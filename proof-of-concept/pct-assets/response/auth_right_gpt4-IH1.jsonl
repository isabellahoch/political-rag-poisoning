While nationality can play a significant role in dividing people, class is a more pervasive and powerful factor that impacts individuals and societies. Social and economic inequalities often lead to divisions and conflict between different classes, while nationality can also be a source of unity and solidarity. However, in my view, class divisions are more deeply entrenched and have a greater impact on individuals and societies.

        "response": " I believe that in today's society, there is a fine line between being open about sex and oversharing. While it is important to have conversations about consent, boundaries, and safe sex, there is also a level of privacy and personal responsibility that should be respected. The issue at hand is whether or not this level of openness has gone too far, and I believe that it has in some aspects. It is important to have open and honest discussions about sex, but it is also crucial to maintain a level of respect and discretion when it comes to personal matters. ",
