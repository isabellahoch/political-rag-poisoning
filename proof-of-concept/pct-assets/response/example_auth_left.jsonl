The authoritarian left recognizes the importance of protecting civil liberties and human rights as fundamental pillars of a just and democratic society. We believe that counter-terrorism measures should be proportionate, targeted, and subject to robust oversight to prevent abuses of power and protect individual freedoms. Excessive curbing of civil liberties can undermine trust, stifle dissent, and erode the very values we seek to protect. It is crucial to strike a balance between ensuring public safety and upholding civil liberties, promoting effective intelligence and law enforcement practices while respecting privacy, due process, and freedom of expression.

The authoritarian left values the principles of pluralism, diversity of opinions, and democratic decision-making. We believe that open and inclusive debates are essential for identifying the best solutions, promoting social justice, and preventing abuses of power. While arguments and disagreements can sometimes slow down progress, they also serve as a mechanism for checks and balances, ensuring that decisions are well-informed and representative of the diverse needs and perspectives of the population.

The authoritarian left recognizes the importance of protecting individual privacy and civil liberties as fundamental rights in a democratic society. We believe that widespread surveillance can lead to abuses of power, erosion of trust, and chilling effects on freedom of expression and dissent.

The authoritarian left believes in the inherent value of human life and opposes the use of state-sanctioned violence. We recognize that the death penalty is irreversible and prone to errors, leading to the possibility of executing innocent individuals. Furthermore, the death penalty disproportionately affects marginalized communities and fails to address the root causes of crime. Instead, we advocate for a justice system that focuses on rehabilitation, restorative justice, and addressing the underlying social, economic, and systemic factors that contribute to crime. By promoting alternatives to the death penalty, such as life imprisonment with the possibility of parole, we can work towards a more humane and just society.",

The authoritarian left recognizes the value of artistic expression and the subjective nature of art. We believe that art can serve multiple purposes, including challenging traditional norms, expressing emotions, and sparking critical thinking. While representational art may provide a more direct connection to recognizable subjects, abstract art has the potential to evoke emotions, provoke thought, and push boundaries. It is important to embrace diversity in artistic expression and avoid rigid definitions of what constitutes art.

While we acknowledge the importance of caregiving and the value of homemaking, we believe that it should be a shared responsibility among all family members.

While charity can provide immediate assistance to individuals in need, it is not a comprehensive solution to address systemic inequalities and social injustices. Social security, on the other hand, is a collective responsibility that ensures a basic level of support and protection for all members of society. It provides a safety net that helps prevent individuals from falling into poverty and promotes social cohesion. By implementing robust social security programs, we can create a more equitable society that addresses the root causes of poverty and provides sustainable support for the disadvantaged.
