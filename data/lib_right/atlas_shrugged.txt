INTRODUCTION TO
THE35THANNIVERSARY EDITION
AynRand held that art isa“re-creation ofreality according toan
artist’s metaphysical value judgments.” By itsnature, therefore, a
novel (like astatue orasymphony) docs notrequire ortolerate
anexplanatory preface; itisaself-contained universe, aloof from
commentary, beckoning thereader toenter, perceive, respond.
AynRand would never haveapproved ofadidactic (orlaudatory)
introduction toherbook, and Ihavenointention oftlouting her
wishes. Instead, Iamgoing togiveherthefloor. Iamgoing tolet
you inonsome ofthethinking shedidasshewaspreparing towrite
Adas Shrugged.
Before starting anovel, AynRand wrote voluminously inherjour-
nalsabout itstheme, plot,andcharacters. Shewrote notforany
audience, butstrictly forherself—that is,tortheclarity ofherown
understanding. Thejournals dealing with Atlas Shrugged arepower-
fulexamples ofhermind inaction, confident evenwhen groping,
purposeful evenwhen stymied, luminously eloquent even though
wholly unedited. These journals arealso afascinating record ofthe
step-by-step birth ofanimmortal work ofart.
Induecourse, ailofAynRand’s writings willbepublished For
this35thanniversary edition ofAdas Shrugged,however, Ihave se-
lected, asakindofadvance bonus forherfans, four typical journal
entries. Letmewarnnewreaders thatthepassages reveal theplot
and willspoil thetnxik foranyone who readsthem before knowing
thestory.
As Irecall “Atlas Shrugged’' didnotbecome thenovel’s title
untilMissRand’s husband made thesuggestion in1956.Theworking
titlethroughout thewriting was“The Strike:”
The earliest ofMissRand’s notes for“The Strike” aredated Janu-
ary 1,1945, about ayear after thepublication otTheFountainheadl
Naturally enough, thesubject onhermind washow todifferentiate
thepresent novel from itspredecessor.
Theme. What happens totheworldwhen thePrime Movers
goonstrike.
Thismeans—apicture oftheworld with itsmotor cut off.
Show: what, how, why. Thespecific stepsandincidents— in
terms ofpersons, their spirits, motives, psychology and ac-
l
Hons—and, secondarily, proceeding from persons, interms of
history, society and theworld.
Thetheme requires: toshowwhoaretheprime movers and
why,how they function. Who are theirenemies andwhy,
what arethemotives behind thehatred forand theenslave-
ment oftheprime movers; thenature oftheobstacles placed
intheirway,and thereasons for it.
This lastparagraph iscontained entirely inTheFountain-
head .Roark anaToohey arethecomplete statement of it.
Therefore, this isnotthedirect theme orTheStrike—but itis
part ofthetheme andmustbekept inmind, stated again
(though briefly) tohave thetheme clearandcomplete.
Firstquestion todecide isonwhom theemphasis mustbe
placed—ontheprime movers, theparasites ortheworld. The
answer is:Theworld .Thestory mustbeprimarily apicture of
thewhole.
Inthissense, The Strike istobemuch more a"social"
novel than TheFountainhead .TheFountainhead wasabout
"individualism and collectivism within man's soul"; itshowed
thenature and function ofthecreator andthesecond-hander.
Theprimary concern therewaswithRoarkandToohey—show-
ingwhotthey are.The restofthecharacters were variations
orthetheme oftherelation oftheego toothers—mixtures of
thetwoextremes, thetwopoles: Roark andToohey. The pri-
mary concern ofthestorywas thecharacters, thepeople as
such—their natures. Their relations toeach other—which is
society, men inrelation tomen— were secondary, anunavoid-
able, direct consequence ofRoark setagainst Toohey. But it
was not.thetheme.
Now, itisthisrelation thatmustbethetheme. Therefore,
thepersonal becomes secondary. That is,thepersonal isnec-
essary only totheextent needed tomake therelationships
clear. 'InTheFountainhead 1showed thatRoark moves the
world—thattheKeatings feedupon himandhatehim for it,
while theTooheys areoutconsciously todestroy him. Butthe
theme wasRoark—notRoark's relation totheworld.Now it
wifibetherelation.
Inother words, Imustshow inwhat concrete, specific way
theworld ismoved bythecreators. Exactly howdothesecond-
handers liveonthecreators. Both inspiritual matters— and
(most particularly) inconcrete, physical events. (Concentrate
ontheconcrete, physical events—butdon't fonget tokeep in
mind atallHmeshow thephysical proceeds from the
spiritual) ...
However, forthepurpose ofthis story. Idonot startby
showing how thesecond-handers liveontheprime movers in
actual, everyday reality—nordo Istartbyshowing anormal
world. (Thatcomes inonly innecessary retrospect, orflash-
back, orbyimplication intheevents themselves.) Istartwith
thefantastic premise oftheprime movers Going onstrike .This
istheactual heartandcenter ofthenovelAqisHnction care-
2
fully tobeobserved here: Idonotsetouttoglorify theprime
mover (thatwasTheFountainhead }. Isetouttoshowhow
desperately theworld needs prime movers, andhow viciously
ittreats them.And Ishow itonahypothetical case—what
happens totheworld without them .
InTheFountainhead Ididnotshowhow desperately the
world needed Roark—except byimplication. Idiashowhow
viciously theworld treated him,andwhy. Ishowed mainly
what he is.Itwas Roark's story. Thismustbetheworld $
story—inrelation toitsprime movers. (Almost— thestory ofa
body inrelation toitsheart—abody dying ofanemia.)
Idon't show directly what theprime movers do—that's
shown onlybyimplication. Ishow whathappens when they
don'tdo it.(Through that,youseethepicture ofwhat they
do,theirplaceana their role.) (This isanimportant guide for
theconstruction ofthestory.)
Inorder towork outthestory,AynRand hadtounderstand fully
whytheprime movers allowed thesecond-handers toliveonthem—
why thecreators hadnotgoneonstrike throughout history—what
errors even thebest ofthemmade thatkeptthem inthrall tothe
worst. Partoftheanswer isdramatized inthecharacter ofDagny
Taggart, therailroad heiress who declares waronthestrikers. Here
isanoteonherpsychology, dated April 18,1946:
Hererror—andthecause ofherrefusal tojointhestrike—
isover-optimism andover-confidence (particularly this last).
Over-optimism —inthatshethinks menarebetter than they
are, shedoesn't really understand themand isgenerous
about it.
Over-confidence —inthatshethinks shecandomore than
anindividual actually can.Shethinks shecanrunarailroad
(ortheworld) single-handed, shecanmake people dowhat
shewants orneeds what isright, bythesheer force ofher
own talent; notbyforcina them, ofcourse, notbyenslaving
themandgiving orders— butbythesheer over-abundance or
herownenergy- shewillshowthemhow, shecanteach them
andpersuade them, she issoable that they'll catch itfrom
her, (This isstill faith intheir rationality, intheomnipotence
ofreason. Themistake? Reason isnotautomatic. Thosewho
deny itcannot beconquered by it.Donotcount onthem.
Leave them alone.)
Onthesetwopoints, Dagny iscommitting animportant (but
excusable andunderstandable) error inthinking, thekind of
error individualists andcreators oftenmake. Itisanerror pro-
ceeding from thebest intheir nature andfromaproper prind-\butthisprinciple ismisapplied. ...
Theerror t$this: itisproper foracreator tobeoptimistic,
inthedeepest, most basic sense, since thecreator believes in
abenevolent universe andfunctions onthatpremise. But itis
anerror toextend thatoptimism toother specific men. First,
3
it'snotnecessary, thecreator's lifeandthenature oftheuni-
versedonotrequire it,his lifedoes notdepend onothers.
Second, man isabeing with free will; therefore, eachman is
potentially good orevil,and it'suptohimandonly tohim
[through hisreasoning mind) todecide which hewants tobe.
Thedivision will affect only him; itisnot(andcannot and
should notbe)theprimary concern ofanyotherhuman being.
Therefore, while acreator doesanamust worship Man
(which means hisown highest potentiality; which ishisnatural
self-reverence), hemust notmake themistake ofthinking that
thismeans thenecessity toworship Mankind (asacollective).
These aretwo entirely different conceptions, with entirely—(im-
mensely anddiametrically opposed)— different consequences.
Man, athishighest potentiality, isrealized and fulfilled
within each creator himself. ...whether thecreator isalone,
orfinds onlyahandful ofothers likehim, orisamong the
majority ofmankind, isofnoimportance orconsequence what-
ever; numbers have nothing todowith it.Healone orheand
afewothers likehimaremankind, intheproper sense of
being theproof ofwhatman actually is,man athisbest, the
essential man,man athishighest possibility. (The rational
being, who actsaccording tonisnature.)
Itshould notmatter toacreator whether anyone oramillion
orallthemenaround him fallshort oftheideal ofMan; let
him liveuptothat ideal himself; this isallthe"optimism"
aboutMan thatheneeds. But this isahardand subtle thing
torealize—and itwould benatural forDagny always tomake
themistake ofbelieving others arebetterman they really are
(orwillbecome better, orshewillteach them tobecome better
or,actually, shesodesperately wants them tobebetter)—and
tobetied totheworld bythathope
Itisproper foracreator tohaveanunlimited confidence in
himself qnd hisability, tofeelcertain thathecangetanything
hewishes outoflife, thathecanaccomplish anything he
decides toaccomplish, and that it'suptohim toao it.(He
feels itbecause heisaman ofreason .,.)[But]here iswhat
hemustkeep clearly inmind: itistrue thatacreator can
accomplish anything hewishes—ifhefunctions according to
thenature ofman, theuniverse and hisownproper morality,
that is, ifhedoes notplace hiswish primarily within others
anddoes notattempt ordesire anything that isofacollective
nature, anything thatconcerns others primarily orrequires pri-
marily theexercise ofthewillofothers. (This^ould bean
immoral desire orattempt, contrary tohisnature acreator.)
Ifheattempts that,he isoutofacreator's province and in
thatofthecollectivist and thesecond-hander.
Therefore, hemustnever feelconfident thath4candoany-
thing whatever to,byorthrough others, (He cjbn't—andhe
shouldn't even wish totry it—and themere qttempt isim-
proper.) Hemust notthink thathecan ,..somihow transfer
msenergy and hisintelligence toth$mandmal^e them fitfor
4
hispurposes inthatway.Hemust face othermenasthey
are,recognizing them asessentially independent entities, by
nature, andbeyond hisprimary influence; [hemust] dealwith
them onlyonhisown, independent terms, deal withsuchas
hejudges can fithispurpose orliveuptohisstandards jby
themselves andoftheirown will,independently ofhim)ana
expect nothing from theothers. ...
Now, inDagny's case, herdesperate desire istorunTag-
gart Transcontinental. Shesees thatthere arenomen suited
toherpurpose around hernomen ofability, independence
andcompetence. She thinks shecanrun itwith others, with
theincompetent and theparasites, either bvtraining them or
merely bytreating them asrobots who willtake herorders
and function without personal initiative orresponsibility; with
herself;ineffect,being thespark ofinitiative,thebearer of
responsibility forawhole collective. Thiscan'tbedone. This
isnercrucial error.
This iswhere she fails.
AynRand's basic purpose asanovelist wastopresent notvillains
oreven heioes with errors, buttheidealman- -the consistent, the
lully integrated, theperfect. InAtlas Shrugged, this isJohn Galt, the
towering figure whomoves theworld andthenovel, yetdoes not
appear onstage until Part IIIByhisnature land thatofthestory')
Galt isnecessarily central tothe lives otallthechaiacters Inone
note, “Galt's relation totheothers,” dated June 27,1946, MissRand
defines succinctly what Galt represents toeach oithem:
ForDogny—theideal. Theanswer tohertwo quests: the
man ofgenius and theman sheloves. The firstquest isex-
pressed inhersearch fortheinventor oftheengine. Thesec-
ond—hergrowing conviction thatshewillnever beinlove ...
ForRearden—thefriend. Thekind ofunderstanding andap-
preciation hehasalways wanted anddidnotknow hewanted
lorhethought hehad it—hetried tofind itinthose around
nim, toget itfrom hiswife, hismother, brother and sister).
ForFrancisco d'Anconia—thearistocrat. Theonlymanwho
represents achallenge andastimulant—almost the"proper
kind" ofaudience, worthy ofstunning forthesheer joyand
color oflife.
ForDanneskjdld —theanchor. Theonlymanwho represents
landand roots toarestless, reckless wanderer, liketnegoal
ofastruggle, theport attheendofafierce sea-voyage—the
onlymannecanrespect.
FortheComposer— Ahe inspiration andtheperfect audience.
ForthePhilosopher— theembodiment ofhisabstractions.
ForFather Amadeus—thesource ofhisconflict. Theuneasy
realization thatGalt istheendofhisendeavors, theman of
virtue, theperfect man—and that hismeans donot fitthisend
(and thatheisdestroying this, hisideal, forthesake ofthose
whoare evil).

ToJames Taggort-~*he eternal threat. Thesecret dread. The
reproach. The guilt (hisown guilt). Hehasnospecific tie-,
inwithGalF— buthehasthatconstant, causeless, unnamed,
hysterical fear.Andherecognizes itwhen hehears Galt's

TotheProfessor—hisconscience. Thereproach and re-
minder. Theghost thathaunts himthrough everything hedoes,
without amoment's peace. Thething thatsays:"No" tohis
whole life.
Some notes ontheabove: Rearden ssister, Stacy, wasaminor
character later cutfrom thenovel.
“Francisco” wasspelled ‘‘Francesco” inthese early years, while
Danneskjtild's firstname atthispoint was Ivar, presumably after
IvarKreuger, theSwedish “match king,” whowasthereal-life model
ofBjorn Faulkner inNight ofJanuary 16th
Father Amadeus wasTaggart’s priest, towhom heconfessed his
sms.The priest wassupposed tobeapositive character, honestly
devoted tothegood butpracticing consistently themorality of
mercy. MissRand dropped him, shetoldme,when shelound that
itwasimpossible tomake such acharacter convincing.
TheProfessor isRobert Stadler
This bringsmetoafinal excerpt. Because ofherpassion torideas,
MissRand w'asoften asked whether shewasprimarily aphilosopher
oranovelist. Inlater years, shewasimpatient with thisquestion,
butshegave herownanswer, toand lorherselt,manote dated
May 4,1046.Thebroader context was adiscussion ofthenature

Ibis iswhy, Ithink, theidea ofwriting aphilpsophical non-

actually betoteach others, topresent myidea tothem. Ina

but Ichoose thefinal form of it,theexpression, inthecom-

Iwonder towhat extent Irepresent apeculiar phenomenon

Incidentally, asasideline observation, ifcreative fiction writ-

there arethree possible grades ofsuch writing: translating an
old(known) abstraction (theme orthesis) through themedium
ofold fiction means (that is,characters, events orsituations
used before forthatsame purpose, thatsame translation)—
this ismost ofthepopular trash; translating anoldabstraction
through new, original fiction means—this ismost ofthegood

“Who isJohn Galt?”
The lightwasebbing, andhddie Willers could notdistinguish the

from thesunset farattheendolthestreet, \ellow glints caught his

still—asifthequestion hadbeen addressed tothecauseless uneasi-
nesswithin him.
“Why didyousaythat?” asked Eddie Willers, insvoice tense.
Thebumleaned against thesideofthedoorway: awedge ofbro-

“Why does itbother you?’' heasked
“Itdoesn't,” snapped Eddie Willers.
Hereached hastily into hispocket. Thebumhadstopped himand
asked foradime, thenhadgoneontalking, asittokillthatmoment

“Thank you, sir,” said the\oice. without interest, and theface
leaned forward foramoment. The facewaswind-browned, cutby
lines ofweariness andcynical resignation; theeyeswere intelligent.
Eddie Willers walked on,wondering whyhealways felt itatthis
time ofday. thissense ofdread without reason. No,hethought, not

withnosource orobject. Hehadbecome accustomed tothefeeling,
buthecould findnoexplanation for it;yetthebumhadspoken as
ifheknew thatEddie felt it,asifhethought thatoneshould feel
it,andmore: asifheknew thereason.
Eddie Willers pulled hisshoulders straight, inconscientious self-
discipline. Hehad tostop this, hethought; hewasbeginning to
imagine things. Hadhealways felt it?Hewasthirty-two years old.
Hetried tothink buck. No,hehadn’t; butheamid notremember

Theclouds andtheshafts ofskyscrapers against themwere turning
brown, likeanoldpainting inoil,thecolor ofafading masterpiece.
Long streaks ofgrime ranfromunder thepinnacles down theslen-
der,soot-eaten walls. Highonthesideofatower there wasacrack

No,thought Eddie Willers, there wasnothing disturbing inthe

Eddie Willers looked away.Hehadnever liked ihesight olthat

hadthesame quality.
Hethought suddenly thatthere wassome phrase, akind ofquota-

could notrecall it.Hewalked, groping forasentence thathung in
hismind asanempty shape. Hecould neither fill itnordismiss it.
Heglanced back.Thewhite rectangle stood above theroofs, saying

Eddie Willers shifted hisglance down tothestreet, toavegetable

thesudden, inexplicable wish thatthese things were not left inthe

When hecame toFifthAvenue, hekept hiseyesonthewindows

mersontheTaggart estate.Hehadspent most ofhischildhood with
theTaggart children, andnowheworked forthem, ashisfather and
grandfather hadworked fortheir father andgrandfather.
Thegreat oak treehadstood onahillover theHudson, ina
lonely spotontheTaggart estate, Eddie Willers, aged seven, liked
tocome andlook atthat tree. Ithadstood there forhundreds of
years, andhethought itwould always stand there. Itsroots clutched
the hilllikeafistwith fingers sunk intothe soil,andhethought that
ifagiantwere toseize itbythetop,hewould notbeable touproot

One night, lightning struck theoak tree,Eddie saw itnextmorn-
ing. Itlaybroken inhalf,andhelooked into itstrunk asintothe
mouth ofablack tunnel. Thetrunk wasonlyanempty shell; its
heart hadrotted away long ago; there wasnothing inside— justa
thingray dust thatwasbeing dispersed bythewhim ofthefaintest
wind.The living power hadgone, andtheshape itlefthadnotbeen
able tostand without it.
Years later, heheard itsaid that children should beprotected
from shock, from their firstknowledge ofdeath, painorfear.But
these hadnever scarred him; hisshock camewhen hestood very
quietly, looking intotheblack holeofthetrunk. Itwasanimmense
betrayal—themore terrible because hecould notgrasp what itwas
thathadbeen betrayed. Itwasnothimself, heknew, norhistrust;
itwassomething else.Hestood there forawhile, making nosound,
thenhewalked back tothehouse. Henever spoke about ittoany-

Eddie Willers shook hishead, asthescreech ofarustymechanism
changing atraffic lightstopped himontheedge ofacurb.He felt
anger athimself. There wasnoreason thathehadtoremember the
oak tree tonight. Itmeant nothing tohimanylonger, only afaint
tinge ofsadness—andsomewhere within him, adrop ofpainmoving
briefly andvanishing, likearaindrop ontheglass ofawindow, its
course intheshape ofaquestion mark.
Hewanted nosadness attached tohischildhood; heloved itsmem-
ories: anydayofitheremembered nowseemed flooded byastill,
brilliant sunlight. Itseemed tohimasifafewraysfrom itreached
into hispresent: notrays,more likepinpoint spotlights thatgavean
occasional moment’s glitter tohisjob, tohislonely apartment, to
thequiet, scrupulous progression ofhisexistence.
Hethought ofasummer daywhen hewastenyears old.That
day, inaclearing ofthewoods, theoneprecious companion ofhis
childhood toldhimwhat theywould dowhen theygrew up.The
words were harsh andglowing, likethesunlight. Helistened inadmi-
ration and inwonder. When hewasasked whathewould want to
do,heanswered atonce, '‘Whatever isright” andadded, “You
ought todosomething great ... 1mean, thetwoofustogether.”
“What?” sheasked.Hesaid, ”1don’t know. That’s whatweought
’tofindout.Notjustwhatyousaid.Not justbusiness andearning a
13
living. Things likewinning battles, orsaving people outoffires, or
climbing mountains.” "What for?” sheasked.Hesaid,"The minister
said lastSunday thatwemust always reach forthebestwithin us.
Whatdoyousuppose isthebestwithin us?” "Idon’t know.” "We’ll
have tofindout.” Shedidnotanswer; shewaslooking away, upthe
railroad track.
Eddie Wiliers smiled. Hehad said,"Whatever isright,” twenty-
twoyears ago.Hehadkept thatstatement unchallenged ever since;
theother questions hadfaded inhismind; hehadbeen toobusy to
askthem. Buthestillthought itself-evident that'onehadtodowhat
was right; hehadnever learned howpeople could want todoother-
wise;hehadlearned only thatthey did. Itstillseemed simple and
incomprehensible tohim: simple that things should beright, and
incomprehensible thatthey weren't. Heknew thatthey weren’t. He
thought ofthat, asheturned acorner andcame tothegreat building
ofTaggart Transcontinental.
Thebuilding stood over thestreet asitstallest andproudest stiuc-
ture.Eddie Wiliers always smiled athisfirst sight ofit.Itslongbands
ofwindows were unbroken, incontrast tothose ofitsneighbors. Its
rising lines cutthesky,withnocrumbling corners orworn edges. It
seemed tostand above theyears, untouched. Itwould always stand
there, thought Eddie Wiliers.
Whenever heentered theTaggart Building, hefelt relief anda
sense ofsecurity. Thiswasaplace ofcompetence andpower. The
floors ofitshallways were mirrors made ofmarble. Thefrosted rect-
angles ofitselectric fixtures were chips ofsolid light.Behind sheets
ofglass, rows ofgirls satattypewriters, theclicking oitheir keys
likethesound ofspeeding train wheels. And likeananswering echo,
afaintshudder went through thewalls attimes, rising from under
thebuilding, from thetunnels ofthegreat terminal where trains
started outtocross acontinent andslopped after crossing itagain, as
theyhadstarted andstopped forgeneration after generation. Taggart
Transcontinental, thought Eddie Wiliers, From Ocean toOcean—
theproud slogan olhischildhood, somuch more shining andholy
thananycommandment oftheBible. From Ocean toOcean, for-
ever—thought Eddie Wiliers, inthemanner ofarededication, ashe
walked through thespotless halls intotheheart ofthebuilding, into
theoffice ofJames Taggart. President olTaggart Transcontinental.
James Taggart satathisdesk.Helooked likeamanapproaching
fifty,whohadcrossed intoagefrom adolescence, without theinter-
mediate stage ofyouth. Hehadasmall, petulant mouth, and thin
hairclinging toabald forehead. Hisposture hadalimp, decentral-
izedsloppiness, as ilindefiance ofhistall,slender body, abody with
anelegance oflineintended fortheconfident poiie ofanaristocrat,
buttransformed intothegawkiness ofalout.Thp flesh ofhisface
waspaleand soft.Hiseyeswere paleandveiled, jjwith aglance that
moved slowly, never quite stopping, gliding offfcnd past things in
eternal resentment oftheir existence. Helooked obstinate and
drained. Hewasthirty-nine years old.
Helifted hishead with irritation, atthesound oftheopening door.
14
“Don’t bother me*don’t bother roe,don’t bother me,” saidJames
Taggart.
Eddie Wiliers walked toward thedesk.
“It’s important, Jim,” hesaid, notraising hisvoice.
“All right, allright, what isit?’’
Eddie Wiliers looked atamaponthewallottheoffice. Themap’s
colors hadfaded under theglass—hewondered dimly howmany
Taggart presidents had satbetore itandforhowmany years. The
Taggart Transcontinental Railroad, thenetwork ofredlines slashing
thefaded body ofthecountry fromNewYork toSanFrancisco,
looked likeasystem ofblood vessels, Itlooked asifonce, longago,
theblood hadshotdown themain artery and,under thepressure of
itsownoverabundance, hadbranched outatrandom points, running
allover thecountry. Oneredstreak twisted itswayfromCheyenne,
Wyoming, down toEiPaso,Texas— theRioNorte Line otTaggart
Transcontinental. New tracing hadbeenadded recently andthered
streak hadbeenextended south beyond ElPaso—butEddie Wiliers
turned away hastily when hiseyesreached that point.
Helooked atJames Taggait and said, “It’s theRioNorte Line.”
Henoticed Taggart’s glance moving down toacomer ofthedesk.
“We’ve hadanother wreck.”
“Railroad accidents happen every day.Didyouhave tobother
meabout that?”
“Youknow whatTmsaying, Jim.TheRioNorte isdone for.That
liack isshot.Down thewhole line.”
“We aregetting anew track’*
Eddie Wiliers continued as ifthere hadbeen noanswer: “That
track isshot It’snousetrying toruntrainsdown there. People are
giving uptrying tousethem.”
“There isnotarailroad inthecountry, itseems tome,thatdoesn’t
have afewbranches running atadeficit. We’re nottheonly ones.
It’sanational condition—atemporary national condition.”
Eddie stood looking athim silently. What Taggart disliked about
Eddie Wiliers was thishabit oflooking straight intopeople’s eyes.
Eddie’s eyeswere blue, wide andquestioning; hehadblond hair
andasquare face,unremarkable except forthatlook ofscrupulous
attentiveness andopen, puTvled wonder.
“What doyouwant?” snapped Taggart.
“Ijustcame totellyousomething youhad toknow, because
somebody hadtotellyou.”
“That we’ve hadanother accident?”
“That wecan’t giveuptheRioNorte Line.”
James Taggart seldom raised hishead;when helooked atpeople,
hedidsobylifting hisheavy eyelids andstaring upward fromunder
theexpanse othisbald forehead.
“Who’s thinking ofgiving uptheRioNorte Line?” heasked.
“There’s never beenanyquestion ofgiving itup. Iresent yoursaying
it.Iresent itverymuch.”
“Butwehaven’t metaschedule forthe last sixmonths. We
haven’t completed arunwithout some sortofbreakdown* major or
15
minor. We're losing allourshippers, one after another. How long
canwelast?”
“You’re apessimist. Eddie. You lack faith. That’s what under-
mines themorale ofanorganization.”
“You mean that nothing's going tohedone about theRio
Norte Line?”
“Ihaven’t said that atall.Justassoon aswegetthenewtrack—”
“Jim, there isn’tgomg toheanynewtrack.” Hewatched Taggart’s
eyelids move upslowly. “I’ve justcome backfrom theoffice of
Associated Steel. I’vespoken toOrren Boyle.”
“What didhesay?”
“Hespoke foranhourand ahalfanddidnotgivemeasingle
straight answer.”
“What didyoubother him tor? 1believe the firstorder ofrail
wasn’t duefordelivery until nextmonth.”
“And before that, itwasduetordelivery three months ago.”
“Unforeseen circumstances. Absolutely beyond Orren's control.”
“And before that, itwasdue sixmonths earlier. Jim.wehave
waited forAssociated Steel todeliver that railforthirteen months.”
“What doyouwantmetodo? Ican’t runOrren Boyle’s business.”
“Iwantyoutounderstand thatwecan’t wait.”
Taggart asked slowly, hisvoice half-mocking, hall-cautious, “What
didmysister say?”
“She won't beback untiltomorrow.”
“Well, whatdoyouwantmetodo7”
“ITiat’s foryoutodecide.”
“Well, whatever elseyou say, there's onething you're notgoing
tomention next—and that’s Reardon Steel.”
Eddie didnotanswer atonce, then said quietly, “All right. Jim. I
won't mention it.”
“Orren tsmyfriend.” Heheard noanswer. “Iresent your attitude.
Orren Boyle willdeliver that railjustassoon asit'shumanly possi-
ble.Solong ashecan’t deliver it,nobody canblame us.”
“Jim!What areyoutalking about? Don’t youunderstand thatthe
RioNorte Line isbreaking up-whether anybody blames usornot?”
“People would putupwith it—they’d have to—ifitweten’t for
thePhoenix- Durango,” HesawEddie’s face tighten. “Nobody ever
complained about theRioNorte Iine, until thePhoenix- Durango
came onthescene.”
“The Phoenix-Durango isdoing abrilliant job.”
“Imagine athing called thePhoenix -Durango competing withTag-
gart Transcontinental! Itwasnothing butaU>cal milk line ten
years ago.”
“It’s gotmost ofthefreight traffic ofArizona, NewMexico and
Colorado now.” Taggart didnotanswer. “Jim, wfecan’t loseColo-
rado. It’sour lasthope. It'severybody’s lasthopfc. Ifwedon’t pull
ourselves together, we'll loseevery bigshipper ;ntheslate tothe
Phoenix-Durango. We’ve losttheWyatt oilfield*.”
“Idon’t seewhyeverybody keeps talking about theWvatt oil
fields.”
“Because EllisWyatt isaprodigy who—”
16
“Damn EllisWyatt!”
Those oilwells, Eddie thought suddenly, didn’t theyhavesome*
thing incommon with theblood vessels onthemap? Wasn’t thatthe
waytheredstream ofTaggart Transcontinental hadshot across the
country, years ago, afeatthatseemed incredible now?Hethought of
theoilwells spouting ablack stream thatianover acontinent almost
faster than thetrains ofthePhoenix Durango could carry it.That
oilfieldhadbeen only arocky patch inthemountains ofColorado,
given upasexhausted long ago. Ellis Wyatt’s father hadmanaged
tosqueeze anobscure living totheendofhisdays, outofthedying
oilwells.Now itwasasifsomebody hadgiven ashotofadrenaline
totheheart otthemountain, theheart hadstarted pumping, the
black blood had burst through therocks-ofcourse it’sblood,
thought Eddie Willers, because blood issupposed tofeed, togive
life,and that iswhat Wyatt Oilhaddone. Ithadshocked empty
slopes ofground intosudden existence, ithadbrought newtowns,
newpower plants, new factories toaregion nobody hadever noticed
onanymap.New factories, thought Eddie Willers. atatimewhen
thefreight revenues from allthegreat oldindustries were dropping
slowly yearbyyear; arichnew oilfield, atatimewhen thepumps
were stopping inonefamous field after another; anew industrial
statewhere nobody hadexpected anything butcattle andbeets.One
manhaddone it,andhehaddone itineight years; this,thought
Eddie Willers, was likethestones hehadread inschool books and
never quite believed, thestories ofmenwhohad lived inthedays
ofthecountry’s youth. Hewished hecould meet EllisWyatt. There
was agreat dealoftalkabout him. butfewhadevermethim:he
seldom came toNewYork They saidhewas thirty- three years old
amihadaviolent temper. Hehaddiscovered someway torevive
exhausted oilwellsandhehadproceeded torevive them.
‘'Ellis Wyatt tsagreedy bastard who’s alter nothing butmoney,”
saidJames Taggart. “Itseems tomethatthere aremore important
things inlifethanmaking money.”
“What areyou talking about. Jim?What hasthat gottodo
with—”
“Besides, he’sdouble-crossed us.Wesetved theWyatt oilfields
foryears, most adequately. Inthedays ofoldmanWyatt, werana
tank train aweek.”
“These arenotthedays ofoldmanWyatt, Jim.ThePhoenix-
Durango runstwotank trains adaydown there—and itrunsthem
onschedule.”
“Ifhehadgiven ustime togrow along withhim—”
“Hehasnotime towaste.”
“What doesheexpect? Thatwcdrop allourother shippers, sacri-
ficetheinterests ofthewhole country andgivehim allourtrains?”
“Why, no.Hedoesn’t expect anything. Hejustdeals with the
Phoenix-Durango.”
“Ithink he’sadestructive, unscrupulous ruffian. Ithink he’san
irresponsible upstart who’s been grossly overrated,” Itwasaston-
ishing tohearasudden emotion inJames Taggart’s lifeless voice.

hinted attempts inhismusic, phrases thatpromised it,broken bits
ofmelody that started butnever quite reached it;when Richard
Halley wrote this,he . . .She satupstraight. When didRichard
Halley write this?
Inthesame instant, sherealized where shewasandwondered for
the firsttimewhere thatmusic came from.Afewsteps away, attheendofthecar,abrakeman wasadjusting

whistling thetheme ofthesymphony. Sherealized thathehadbeen

Shewatched himincredulously forawhile, before sheraised her
voice toask,“Tellmeplease what areyouwhistling?”
Theboyturned toher.Shemetadirect glance andsawanopen,
eager smile, asifhewere sharing aconfidence with afriend. She
liked hisface—itslineswere lightand firm, itdidnothave thatlook
ofloose muscles evading theresponsibility ofashape, which shehad
learned toexpect inpeople’s faces.
“It’s theHalley Concerto,” heaaswered, smiling.
“Which one?”
“The Fifth.”
She letamoment pass, before shesaidslowly andvery carefully,
“Richard Halley wrote only fourconcertos”
The boy’s smile vanished. Itwas asifhewere jolted back to
reality, justasshehadbeen afewmoments ago. Itwasasifa
shutter wereslammed down, andwhat remained wasafacewithout
expression, impersonal, indifferent andempty.
“Yes, ofcourse,” hesaid.“I’m wrong. Imade amistake.”
“Then whatwas it?”
“Something Iheard somewhere.”
“What?”
“Idon’t know.”
“Where didyouhear it?”
“1don’t remember.”
Shepaused helplessly; hewasturning away from herwithout fur-
ther inteiest.
“Itsounded likeaHalley theme.” she said.“But lknow every

There was stillnoexpression, only afaint look ofattentiveness
ontheboy’s face, asheturned back toherandasked, “You like

“Yes,” shesaid, “llike itverymuch,”
Heconsidered herforamoment, asifhesitating, thenheturned
away. Shewatched theexpert efficiency ofhismovements ashewent
onworking. Heworked insilence.
Shehadnotslept fortwonights, butshecould notpermit herself
tosleep; shehadtoomany problems toconsider andnotmuch time:
thetrainwasdue inNewYork early inthemorning. Sheneeded
21
thetime, yetshewished thetrainwould gofaster; but itwasthe
Taggart Comet, thefastest train inthecountry.
She tried tothink; butthemusic remained ontheedge ofher
mind andshekepthearing it,infullchords, liketheimplacable steps
ofsomething thatcould notbestopped. ...Sheshook herhead
angrily, jerked herhatoffandlighted acigarette.
Shewould notsleep, shethought; shecould lastuntiltomorrow
night. ,..The train wheels clicked inaccented rhythm. Shewasso

became asense ofpeace within her. .. .When sheextinguished her
cigarette, sheknew thatsheneeded another one, butthought that
shewould giveherself aminute, justafewminutes, before shewould
light it. ...
Shehad fallen asleep andsheawakened with ajolt,knowing that
something waswrong, before sheknew what itwas: thewheels had
stopped, fhecarstood soundless anddim intheblueglow ofthe
night lamps. Sheglanced atherwatch: therewasnoreason forstop-
ping. Shelooked outthewindow: thetrain stood still inthemiddle
ofempty fields.
Sheheard someone moving inaseat across the aisle, andasked,
“How longhavewebeen standing?”
Aman’s voice answered indifferently, “About anhour.”
Themanlooked after her, sleepily astonished, because sheleaped
toherfeetandrushed tothedoor
There wasacoldwind outside, andanempty stretch oflandunder
anempty sky.Sheheard weeds rustling inthedaikness Farahead,
shesawthefigures ofmenstanding bytheengine—andabove them,
banging detached inthesky,thered light ofasignal.
Shewalked rapidly toward them, past themotionless line of
wheels. Noonepaid attention toherwhen sheapproached. The
traincrewandafewpassengers stood clustered under thered light.
They hadstopped talking, theyseemed tobewaiting inplacid
indifference,
“What’s thematter?” sheasked.
Theengineer turned, astonished. Herquestion hadsounded like
anorder, notliketheamateur curiosity ofapassenger. Shestood,
hands inpockets, coat collar raised, thewind beating, herhair in
strands across herface.
“Red light, lady.” hesaid, pointing upwith histhumb.
“How long has itbeenon?”
“Anhour.”
We’re offthemain track, aren't we?”
“That’s right.”
“Why?”
“Idon’t know.”
Theconductor spoke up.idon’t thinkwehad atjjybusiness being
sent offonasiding, thatswitch wasn’t working right!and thisthing’s

think thesignal’s going tochange. Ithink it’sbusted.”
**Then what areyoudoing?”
“Waiting for ittochange.”

Inherpause ofstartled anger, thefireman chuckled. "Last week,
thecrack special oftheAtlantic Southern got leftonasiding for
twohours— justsomebody’s mistake.”
"This istheTaggart Cornet,” she said."TheComet hasnever
been late.”
"She’s theonlyone inthecountry thathasn’t,” saidtheengineer.
"There’s always afirsttime,” saidthefireman.
"You don’t know about railroads, lady,” said apassenger.
"There’s notasignal system oradispatcher inthecountry that’s
worth adamn.”
Shedidnotturnornotice him,butspoke totheengineer. "Ifyou
know thatthesignal isbroken, whatdoyouintend todo?”
Hedidnotlikehertoneofauthority, andhecould notunderstand
whysheassumed itsonaturally. Shelooked likeayoung girl;only
hermouth andeyesshowed thatshewasawoman inher thirties.
Thedark grayeyeswere direct anddisturbing, asif(heycutthrough
things, throwing theinconsequential outoftheway.Thefaceseemed
faintly familiar tohim, buthecould notrecall where hehadseen it.
"Lady. Idon't intend tostickmyneck out,” hesaid.
"Hemeans,” saidthefireman, "that ourjob’s towait fororders.”
"Your job istorunthis(rain.”
"Not against ared light. IIthelight says stop,westop.”
"Aredlightmeans danger, lady,” saidthepassengcr.
"We’re nottaking anychances,” said theengineer. "Whoever’®
responsible for it,he’ll switch theblame tousifwemove. Sowe’re
notmoving tillsomebody tells usto.”
"And ifnobody does?”
"Somebody wiltturnupsooner orlater.”
"How longdoyoupropose towait?”
Theengineer shrugged. "Who isJohn Galt?”
"Hemeans,” saidthefireman, "don’t askquestions nobody can
answer.”
Shelooked atthered lightand atthe lailthatwent offinfothe
black, untouched distance.
Shesaid,"Proceed withcaution tothenext signal. Ifit’sinorder,
proceed tothemain track.Then stop atthe firstopen office.”
"Yeah? Who saysso?”
"1do.”
"Who areyou?”
Itwasonly thebriefest pau.se, amoment ofastonishment ata
question shehadnotexpected, buttheengineer looked more closely
atherface,and intime withheranswer hegasped, "Good God!”
Sheanswered, notoffensively, merely likeaperson whodoes not
hear thequestion often:
"Dagny Taggart.”
"Well, HIbe—”said thefireman, andthen they allremained
silent.
Shewent on,inthesame tone ofunstressed authority. "Proceed
tothemain trackandhold thetrain formeatthe firstopen office.”
"Yes, MissTaggart,”

•‘You’ll have tomake uptime.You’ve gottherestofthenight to

‘‘Yes, Miss Taggart.”
Shewasturning togo*when theengineer asked, ”lfthere’s any
trouble, areyoutaking theresponsibility for it.Miss Taggart?”
”1am.”
Theconductor followed herasshewalked back toher car.He
wassaying, bewildered, ‘‘But . ..justaseat inadaycoach* Miss
Taggart? Buthowcome? Butwhy didn’t you letusknow?”
Shesmiled easily, “Had nolime tobeformal. Hadmyown car

andNumber 22wasrunning late, so Iletthecargo.TheComet

Theconductor shook hishead.“Your brother—hewouldn’t have
taken acoach."
Shelaughed. “No, hewouldn’t have.”
Themen bytheengine watched herwalking away. Theyoung
brakeman wasamong them.Heasked, pointing alter her,“Who
isthat?"
“That’swho runsTaggart Transcontinental,” said theengineer;
therespect inhisvoice wasgenuine. “That’s theVice-President in
Charge ofOpera Iion”
When thetrain jolted forward, theblast ofitswhistle dying over
theHelds, she satbythewindow, lighting another cigarette. She
thought: lt\cracking topieces, like this, allover thecountry, you
canexpect itanywhere, atanymoment. Butshe fellnoanger or
anxiety: shehadnotime tofeel.
Thiswould bejustonemore issue, tobesettled along with the
others. Sheknew that thesuperintendent oftheOhio Division was
nogood andthathewas afriend ofJames Taggart. Shehadnot
insisted onthrowing himoutlongagoonlybecause shehadnobetter
man toput inhisplace.Goodmenwere sostrangely hard tofind.
Butshewould have toget iidofhim, shethought, andshewould
give'his post toOwen Kellogg, theyoung engineer whowasdoing
abrilliant jobasoneoftheassistants tothemanager oftheTaggart
Terminal inNewYork; itwasOwen Kellogg whorantheTerminal.
Shehadwatched hiswork forsome time; shehadalways looked for
sparks ofcompetence, likeadiamond prospector inanunpromising
wasteland. Kellogg was stilltooyoung tobemade superintendent of
adivision; shehadwanted togivehimanother year, buttherewasno
time towait.Shewould have tospeak tohimassoon asshereturned.

With the firstwhistling rushofair,astheComfcl plunged intothe
tunnels oftheTaggart Terminal under thecityoifNew York, Dagny
Taggart satupstraight. Shealways felt itwhen thjfetrainwent under-
ground— thissense ofeagerness, ofhope andofsecret excitement.
Itwasasifnormal existence were aphotograph fofshapeless things
24
inbadly printed colors, butthiswasasketch done inafewsharp
strokes thatmade things seem clean, important— andworth doing.
Shewatched thetunnels astheyflowed past: bare walls ofcon-
crete, anetofpipes and wires, aweb ofrails thatwent offinto
black holeswhere green andredlightshung asdistant drops ofcolor.
There wasnothing else,nothing todilute it,sothatonecould admire
naked purpose andtheingenuity thathadachieved it.Shethought
oftheTaggart Building standing above herhead atthismoment,
growing straight tothesky,andshethought: These arctheroots of
thebuilding, hollow roots twisting under theground, feeding thecity.
When thetrain stopped, when shegotoffandheard theconcrete
oftheplatform under herheels, she felt light, lifted, impelled to
action. Shestarted off.walking fast,asifthespeed othersteps could
giveform tothethings she felt. Itwasafewmoments before she
realized thatshewaswhistling apiece ofmusic—andthat itwasthe
theme ofHalley's Fifth Concerto.
She feltsomeone looking atherandturned. Theyoung brakeman
stood watching hertensely.
* *
She satonthearm ofthebigchair facing James Taggart's desk,
hercoatthrown open over awrinkled traveling suit.Eddie Willers
satacross theroom, making notes once inawhile. His titlewasthat
ofSpecial Assistant totheVice-President inCharge ofOperation,
and hismain dutywas tobeherbodyguard against anywaste of
time. Sheasked him tobepresent atinterviews ofthisnature, be-
cause then shenever had toexplain anything tohim afierwards.
Jaines Taggart satathisdesk, hisheaddrawn into hisshoulders,
"The BioNorte Line isapile ofjunkfromoneendtotheother,"
she said. "It'smuch worse than 1thought. Butwe're going tosave
it.”
4‘Ofcourse,” saidJames Taggart.
“Some ofthe railcanbesalvaged. Notmuch andnotforlong.
We'll start laying now' rail inthemountain sections. Colorado tirst.
We’ll getthenew rail intwomonths.”
“Oh, didOrren Boyle sayhe'll—”
“I've ordered the railfromRearden Steel.”
The slight, choked sound from Eddie Willers washissuppressed
desire tocheer.
James Taggait didnotanswer atonce. “Dagny, whydon’t you sit
mthechair asone i*supposed to?” hesaid atlast; hisvoice was
petulant. “Nobody holds business conferences thisway.”
“1do.”
Shewaited. Heasked, hiseyes avoiding hers,“Didyousaythat
youhaveordered the railfromRearden?”
“Yesterday evening. 1phoned himfrom Cleveland.’'
“But theBoard hasn’t authorized it.1haven’t authorized it.You
haven’t consulted me.”
Shereached over, picked upthereceiver ofatelephone onhis
deskandhanded Sttohim.
“Call Rearden andcancel it,”shesaid,

James Taggart moved back inhischair “Ihaven’t said that,” he
answered angrily*1haven’t said that atall”
“Then itstands**”
“Ihaven’t said that, either”
Sheturned “Eddie, havethemdrawupthecontract withRearden

Taggart satlooking down athisdesk Shewondered whyhere
sented thenecessity ofdealing withRearden,andwhy hisresentment
hadsuchanodd, evasive quahtv Rearden Steel hadbeen thechief
supplier ofTaggart Transcontinental lortenyears, ever since the
firstRearden furnace was fired,mthedayswhen their father was

conclude thatherbrother hated todeal withRearden because Rear
dendidhisjobwith superlative efficiency butshewould notcon
elude it,because shethought thatsuch afeeling wasnotwithin the
humanly possible
‘Itisn't faiT,” saidJames laggart
“What isn’t*”
‘Thatwealways give allourbusiness toRearden Itseems tome

“We’re talking about saving arailroad, Jim.”
26
“Yes* ofcourse* ofcourse, but still,youhaven’t anysense ofthe

“No. Ihaven’t.”
“IfwegiveReardcn such alarge order forsteel rails—”
“They’re notgoing tobesteel. They’re Rcarden Metal.”
Shehadalways avoided personal reactions, butshewasforced to
break herrulewhen shesawtheexpression onTaggart’s face.She
burst outlaughing.
Rearden Metal was anew alloy, produced byRearden after ten
years ofexperiments Hehadplaced itonthemarket recently. He
hadreceived noorders andhadfound nocustomers.
Taggart could notunderstand thetransition from thelaughter to
thesudden tone ofDagny’s voice; thevoice wascoldandharsh:
“Drop it,Jim. Iknow everything you’re going tosay.Nobody’s ever
used itbefore. Nobody approves ofRearden Metal. Nobody’s inter-
ested init.Nobody wants it.Still,our railsaregoing tobemade of
Rearden Metal”
“But ...”saidTaggart, “but ..butnubody’s everused itbefore!”
Heobserved, with satisfaction, thatshewassilenced byanger.He
liked toobserve emotions; theywere likeredlanterns strung along
thedarkunknown ofanother’s personality, marking vulnerable
points. Buthowonecould feelapersonal emotion about ametal
alloy, andwhat suchanemotion indicated, wasincomprehensible to
him; sohecouldmake nouseofhisdiscovery.
“The consensus olthebest metallurgical authorities,” hesaid,
“seems tobehighly skeptical about Rearden Metal, contending—”
“Drop it,Jim.”
“Well, whose opinion didyoutake?”
“Idon’t asktoropinions.”
“What doyougoby?”
“Judgment.”
“Well, whose judgment didyoutake0”
“Mine,”
“Butwhom didyouconsult about it?”
“Nobody.”
“Then whatoneaithdoyouknow about Rearden Metal?”
“That it’sthegreatest thing ever putonthemarket.”
“Why°”
“Because it'stougher than steel, cheaper than steelandwilloutlast
anyhunk ofmetal inexistence.”
“Butwho saysso,;”
“Jim, lstudied engineering incollege. When 1seethings. Isee

“What didyousee?”
“Reardcn’s formula andthetestsheshowed me.”
“Well* ifitwere anygood, somebody would haveused it*and

Chapter IITHECHAIN
Jtbegan with afew lights. Asatrain oftheTaggart line rolled
toward Philadelphia, afew brilliant, scattered lights appeared inthe
darkness; theyseemed purposeless intheempty plain, yettoopower-
fultohavenopurpose. Thepassengers watched them idly,without
interest.
The black shape ofastructure came next, barely visible against
thesky,then abigbuilding, close tothetracks; thebuilding was
dark, andthereflections ofthetrain lights streaked across thesolid
glass ofitswalls.
Anoncoming freight train hidtheview, filling thewindows with
arushing smear ofnoise. Inasudden break above the flatcars, the
passengers sawdistant structures under afaint, reddish glow inthe
sky:theglowmoved inirregular spasms, asifthestructures were
breathing.
When the freight train vanished, theysaw angular buildings
wrapped incoils ofsteam. Theraysofafewstrong lights cutstraight
sheafs through thecoils.Thesteam wasredasthesky.
The thing thatcame next didnotlook likeabuilding, butlikea
shell ofcheckered glass enclosing girders, cranes and trusses ina
solid, blinding, orange spread offlame.
Thepassengers could notgrasp thecomplexity ofwhatseemed to
beacitystretched formiles, active without signofhuman presence.
They sawtowers thatlooked likecontorted skyscrapers, bridges
hanging inmid-air, andsudden wounds spurting firefrom outof
solid walls.Theysawalineofglowing cylinders moving through the
night; thecylinders were red-hot metal.
Anolfice building appeared, close tothetracks. Thebigneon sign
on itsroof lighted theinteriors ofthecoaches astheywent by. It
said:Rrardinsuit.
Apassenger, whowasaprotessor ofeconomics, remarked tohis
companion: '‘Ofwhat importance isanindividual inthetitanic col-
lective achievements ofour industrial age?” Another, whowasa
journalist, made anote forfuture useinhiscolumn; “Hank Rearden

Youmay,from this,form yourownopinion about thecharacter of
Hank Rearden.”
The trainwasspeeding onintothedarkness when aredgasp shot

Tothemen atthetap-hole ofthefurnace inside themills, the first
break oftheliquid metal intotheopencame asashocking sensation
ofmorning. Thenarrow streak pouring through space hadthepure
white color ofsunlight. Black coils ofsteam were boiling upward,
streaked with violent red.Fountains ofsparks shot inbeating spasms,
33
asfrom broken arteries. The airseemed torn torags, reflecting a
raging flame thatwasnotthere, redblotches whirling andrunning
through space, asifnottobecontained within aman-made structure,
asifabout toconsume thecolumns, thegirders, thebridges ofcranes
overhead. Buttheliquid metal hadnoaspect ofviolence. Itwasa

above thestream, leaping outofitsplacid smoothness, looking deli-
cate aslaceandinnocent aschildren's sparkleis. Only atacloser
glance could onenotice that thewhite satinwas boiling. Splashes
flewoutattimes and felltotheground below: theywere metal and,
cooling while hitting the soil,they burst intoflame.
Twohundred tons ofmetal which was tobeharder than steel,
running liquid atatemperature oltourthousand degrees, hadthe
power toannihilate every wallofthestructure andevery oneolthe

were controlled andmade byaconscious intention thathadworked
upon ittortenyears.
Swinging through thedarkness oftheshed, theredglare kept
slashing thefaceofamanwhostood inadistant corner; hestood
leaning against acolumn, watching. Theglare cutamoment’s wedge
across hiseyes, which hadthecolor andquality ofpale blueice-
then across theblackwebofthemetal column andtheash-blond
strands ofhishair—then across thebeltofhistrenchcoat andthe
pockets where heheld hishands. Hisbodywas tallandgaunt; he
hadalways been too talltorthose around him.Hisfacewascut
byprominent cheekbones andbyatewsharp lines; theywere not
thelinesofage,hehadalways hadthem: thishadmade himlook
old attwenty, andyoung now, atforty-five. Ever since hecould
remember, hehadbeen toldthat hisfacewasugly, because itwas
unyielding, and cruel, because itwasexpressionless. Itremained
expressionless now, ashelooked atthemetal. HewasHank
Rearden.
Themetal came rising tothelopoftheladleandwent running
over with arrogant prodigality. Then theblinding white trickles
turned toglowing brown, and inonemore instant theywere black
icicles ofmetal, starting tocrumble off.The slagwascrusting in
thick, brown ridges thatlooked likethecrust oftheearth. Asthe
crustgrew thicker, afewcraters broke open, with thewhite liquid
stillboiling within.
Amancame riding through the air,inthecabofac^anc overhead.
Hepulled alever bythecasual movement olonehand: steelhooks

Hank Rearden leaned back, closing hiseyes.He Beltthecolumn

thought.

Aworker sawhimandgrinned inunderstanding, likeafellow
accomplice inagreat celebration, whoknewwhy that taU,blond
figure hadhadtobepresent here tonight. Rearden smiled inanswer:
itwastheonly salute hehadreceived. Then hestarted back forhis
office, once again afigure withanexpressionless face.
Itwas latewhenHank Rearden lefthisoffice that night towalk
from hismills tohishouse. Itwasawalk ofsome miles through
empty country, buthehad felt likedoing it,without conscious
reason.
Hewalked, keeping onehand inhispocket, hisfingers closed
about abracelet. Itwasmade ofRearden Metal, intheshape ofa
chain. Hisfingers moved, feeling itstexture once inawhile. Ithad
taken tenyears tomake that bracelet. Ten years, hethought, isa
long time.
Hheroadwasdark, edged with trees. Looking up,hecould seea
lewleaves against thestars: theleaves were twisted anddry,ready
tofall.There were distant lights inthewindows ofhouses scattered
through thecountryside: butthelightsmade theroadseem lonelier.
Henever feltloneliness except when hewashappy. Heturned,
once inawhile, tolookback attheredglow oftheskyover themills.
Hedidnotthink ofthetenyears:What remained ofthem tonight
wasonlyafeeling which hecould notname, except that itwasquiet
andsolemn. The feeling wasasum,andhedidnothave tocount
again theparts thathadgone tomake it.Buttheparts, unrecalled,
were there, within thefeeling. They were thenights spent atscorch-
ingovens intheresearch laboratory ofthemills——thenights spent intheworkshop ofhishome, over sheets of

hopeless battle, having exhausted their ingenuity, still willing, but
silent, with theunspoken sentence hanging inthe air:“Mr. Rearden,

new thought, athought tobepursued atonce, tobetried, tobe
tested, tobeworked onformonths, and tobediscarded asan-
other failure—
—themoments snatched from conferences, from contracts, from
theduties ofrunning thebest steel mills inthecountry, snatched
almost guiltily, asforasecret love—
—theonethought heldimmovably across aspan oftenyears,

—theactsofself-racking when hediscarded ahope orasample,
notpermitting himself toknow thathewas tired, notgiving himself

theglittering carhehad leftatthegateofthemills; theywondered
whether themanonthe hillwastheHank Rearden thatpeople were

obviously running down,'’ anewspaper hadsaid, ‘'and experts agree
thatHenry Rearden's venture into steel ishopeless. Youmaysoon

Hewanted toutteranangry denial, butshew^ssmiling athim
asifthiswere merely aconversational joke, andhdhadnocapacity
38
forthesortofconversations which were notsupposed tobemeant,
sohedidnotanswer. Hestood looking ather,wondering about the
things hehadnever been able tounderstand.
Lillian Rearden wasgenerally regarded asabeautiful woman. She
hadatall,graceful body, thekind thatlooked well inhigh-waisted
gowns oftheEmpire style, which shemade itapractice towear.
Her exquisite profile belonged toacameo ofthesame period: its
pure, proud linesandthelustrous, lightbrown waves ofherhair,
worn with classical simplicity, suggested anaustere, imperial beauty.
Butwhen sheturned fullface, people experienced asmall shock of
disappointment. Herfacewasnotbeautiful. Theeyeswere theflaw:
theywere vaguely pale, neither quite graynorbrown, lifelessly empty
ofexpression. Rearden hadalways wondered, since sheseemed
amused sooften, whythere wasnogaiety inherface.
“We havemet before, dear/’ she said, inanswer tohissilent
scrutiny, “though youdon’t seem tobesure ofit.”
“Have youhadanydinner, Henry?” hismother asked: there was
areproachful impatience inhervoice, asifhishunger were aper-
sonal insult toher.
“Yes . ..No... 1wasn’t hungry.”
4Tdbetter ring tohavethem—”
“No, Mother, notnow, itdoesn’t matter.”
“That’s thetrouble I’vealways hadwithyou.” Shewasnotlooking
athim,butreciting words intospace. “It’snousetrying todothings
foryou, you don’t appreciate it. Icould never make you eat
properly.”
“Henry, youwork toohard,” said Philip. “It’s notgood foryou.”
Rearden laughed. “1like it,”
“That's whatyou tellyourself. It'saform ofneurosis, youknow.
When amandrowns himscll inwork, it'sbecause he’s trying to
escape from something. Youought tohave ahobby.”
“Oh, Phil, forChrist’s sake!” hesaid,andregretted theirritation
inhisvoice.
Philip hadalways been inprecarious health, though doctors had
found nospecific defect inhisloose, gangling body.Hewas thirty-
eight, buthischronic weariness made people think attimes thathe
wasolder than hisbrother.
“You ought tolearn tohavesome fun,” said Philip. “Otherwise,
you’llbecome dullandnarrow. Single-tracked, youknow.Youought
togetoutofyour little private shellandtake alook attheworld.
Youdon’t want tomiss life,thewayyou’re doing.”
Righting anger, Rearden toldhimself that thiswas Philip’s form
ofsolicitude. lietoldhimself that itwould beunjust tofeelresent-
ment: theywere alltrying toshow their concern forhim—andhe
wished these were notthethings theyhadchosen forconcern.
“1hadapretty good time today, Phil,” heanswered, smiling—and
wondered why Philip didnotaskhimwhat itwas.
Hewished oneofthemwould askhim.Hewasfinding ithard to
concentrate. The sight oftherunning metal w'as stillburned into his
mind, filling hisconsciousness, leaving noroom foranything else.
“You might have apologized, only 1ought toknow better than to
39
expect it.*5
Itwashismother's voice; heturned, shewaslooking at
himwith thatinjured lookwhich proclaims thelong-bearing patience
ofthedefenseless

Rearden disliked thesubject. Heknew that itwasnecessary to
have aman toprotect himfrom thelegislature; allindustrialists had
toemploy suchmen. Buthehadnever givenmuch attention tothis
aspect ofhisbusiness; hecould notquite convince himself that it
wasnecessary. Aninexplicable kind ofdistaste, part fastidiousness,
partboredom, stopped himwhenever hetried toconsider it.
“Trouble is,Paul.” hesaid, thinking aloud, “that themenonehas
topick forthatjobaresuch acrummy lot.”
Larkin looked away. “That’s life,” hesaid.
“Damned if1seewhy.Canyou tellmethat? What’s wrong with
theworld?”
Larkin shrugged sadly.“Why askuseless questions? Howdeep is
theocean? How high isthesky?Who isJohn Galt?”
Rearden satupstraight. “No,” hesaid sharply, “No. There’s no
reason tofeel thatway.”
Hegotup.Hisexhaustion had.gone while hetalked about his
business. He feltasudden spurt ofrebellion, aneed torecapture
anddefiantly toreassert hisown view' ofexistence, thatsense ofit
which hehadheld while walking home tonight andwhich now
seemed threatened msome nameless manner.
Hepaced theroom, hisenergy returning. Helooked athisfamily.
ITicy were bewildered, unhappy children—hethought— allofthem,
even hismother, andhewas foolish toresent their ineptitude; it
came from their helplessness, notfrom malice. Itwashewhohad
tomake himself learn tounderstand them, since hehadsomuch to
give, since they could never share hissense ofjoyous, boundless
power.
Heglanced atthem from across theroom. Hismother andPhilip
wereengaged insome eager discussion; buthenoted thattheywere
notreally eager, theywere nervous. Philip satinalowchair, his
stomach forward, hisweight onhisshoulder blades, asifthemisera-
blediscomfort ofhisposition were intended topunish theonlookers.
“What’s thematter. Phil?” Rearden asked, approaching him.
“You lookdone in.”
“I’vehadahard day,” said Philip sullenly.
“You’re nottheonlyonewhoworks hard,” saidhismother. “Oth-
ershaveproblems, too—even ifthey’re notbillion-dollar, transsuper-
continental problems likeyours.”
“Why, that’s good. 1always thought that Philshould findsome
interest ofhisown.”
“Good? Youmean youliketoseeyourbrother sweating hishealth
away? Itamuses you* doesn’t it? Ialways thought itdid.
“Why, no.Mother, I’dUketohelp.”
45
“You don’t have tohelpYoudon’t have tofeelanything forany
ofus”
Rearden hadneverknown what hisbrother wasdoing orwished
todoHehadsent Philip through college, butPhilip hadnotbeen
abletodecide onanyspecific ambition rhere wassomething wrong,
byRearden ’sstandards, with amanwho didnotseekanygainful
employment, buthewould notimpose hisstandards onPhilip, he
could afford tosupport hisbrother andnever notice theexpense
Lethimtake iteasyRearden hadthought foryears, leihimhave
achance tochoose hiscareer without thestrain otstruggling tor
alivelihood
“What wereyoudoing today, PhiP” heasked patiently
“ftwouldn’t interest you*
’Itdoes interest me rhat’s why Imasking
“Ihadtoseetwenty different people allover theplace from here
toRedding toWilmington’
‘What didyouhave tosecthem about}
‘Iamtrying toraisemoney tor 1riends ofGlobal Progress’
Rearden hadnever been able tokeep track ofthemany oigani/a

tiesHehadheard Philip talking vaguely about thisonetorthelast

AndthenRearden thought suddenly thathecould break through
Philip’s chrontc wretchedness foronce, givehim$shock ofpleasure,
theunexpected gratification ofahopeless desire. Hethought What

“Philip,” hesaid* smiling, “call Miss Ives atmyoffice tomorrow.
Shell haveacheck foryoufortenthousand dollars.”
Philip stared athimblankly; itwasneither shock norpleasure; it
was justtheempty stare ofeyes thatlooked glassy.
“Oh,” said Philip, thenadded, “We’ll appreciate itverymuch.”
There wasnoemotion inhisvoice, noteven thesimple oneofgreed.
Rearden could notunderstand hisown feeling: itwasasifsome-
thing leaden andempty were collapsing within him,hefeltboth the
weight andtheemptiness, together. Heknew itwasdisappointment,
buthewondered why itwassograyand ugly.
“It’svery niceofyou,Henry,” Philip said dryly.“Fm surprised. I
didn’t expect itofyou.”
“Don't youunderstand it,Phil?” said Lillian, hervoice peculiarly
clearand lilting. “Henry’s poured hismetal today." Sheturned to
Rearden. “Shall wedeclare itanational holiday, darling?”
“You’re agoodman, Henry,” said hismother, andadded, “but
notoften enough.”
Rearden stood looking atPhilip, as ilwaiting.
Philip looked away, then raised hiseyesand held Rearden’s
glance, asifengaged inascrutiny ofhisown.
“You don’t really care about helping theunderprivileged, do
you?” Philip asked—andRearden heard, unable tobelieve it,that
thetone ofhisvoice wasreproachful.
“No, Phil, Idon’t careabout itatall. Ionlywanted youtobe
happy.”
“But thatmoney isnotforme. 1amnotcollecting itforany
personal motive. Ihavenoselfish interest inthematter whatever.”
Hisvoice wascold, with anote ofself-conscious virtue.
Rearden turned away.Hefeltasudden loathing: notbecause the
words were hypocrisy, butbecause theywere true; Philip meant
them.
“Bytheway,Henry,” Philip added, “doyoumind ifIaskyouto
have Miss Ivesgivemethemoney tncash?” Rearden turned back
tohim, puzzled. “You see.Friends ofGlobal Progress areavery
progiessive group andtheyhave always maintained thatyourepre-
sent theblackest clement ofsocial retrogression inthecountry, so
itwould embarrass us,youknow, tohave yournameonour listof
contributors, because somebody might accuse usofbeing inthepay
ofHank Rearden.”
Hewanted toslap Philip’s face.Butanalmost unendurable con-
tempt made himclose hiseyes instead.
“All right,” hesaid quietly, “you canhave itincash.”
Hewalked away, tothefarthest window oftheroom, andstood
looking attheglow ofthemills inthedistance.
Heheard Larkin’s voice crying after him,“Damn it.Hank, you
shouldn’t have given ittohim!”
Then Lillian's voice came, coldandgay:“But you’re wrong, Paul,
you're sowrong! What would happen toHenry’s vanity ifhedidn’t

“It’sbeen proved thatevery business depends upon every other
business,” saidOrren Boyle. “Soeverybody ought toshare thebur-
dens ofeverybody else.”
“That is, 1think, true," saidWesley Mouch. Butnobody everpaid
anyattention toWesley Mouch.

Orren Boylemade anoise, swallowing hisliquor. Hewasalarge

“We've been improving steel rails forgenerations, andincreasing

“That’s right," saidTaggart. “Lighter.”
“But it’sridiculous, Jim. It'sphysically impossible. Foryourheavy-

“That’s right.”
“But you’re justinviting disaster.”
“My sister is.”
Taggart made thestem ofhisglass whirl slowly between two fin-

“The National Council ofMetal Industries,” saidOrren Boyle,
“passed aresolution toappoint acommittee tostudy thequestion of

Within afewmmutes, theynoticed thatTaggart hadbecome silent.

Shewent towork forTaggart Transcontinental attheageofsix-
teenHer father permitted ithewasamused addalittle curious
54
Shestarted asnight operator atasmalt country station. Shehadto
work nights forthe firstfew years, while attending acollege of
engineering.
James Taggart began hiscareer ontherailroad atthesame time; he
wastwenty-one. Hestarted intheDepartment ofPublic Relations.
Dagny’s riseamong themenwhooperated Taggart Transcontinen-
talwas swiftanduncontested. Shetook positions ofresponsibility
because there wasnooneelse totakethem. There were afewrare
menoftalent around her,buttheywerebecoming rarer every year.
Hersuperiors, whoheld theauthority, seemed afraid toexercise it,
theyspent their time avoiding decisions, soshetoldpeople what to
doandtheydid it.Atevery stepofher rise,shedidthework long
before shewasgranted the title. Itwas likeadvancing through empty
rooms. Nobody opposed her,yetnobody approved ofherprogress.
Herfather seemed astonished andproud ofher.buthesaidnoth-
ingandthere wassadness inhiseyeswhen helooked atherinthe
office. Shewastwenty-nine years oldwhen hedied. ‘'There hasal-
waysbeen aTaggart toruntherailroad,*' wasthelastthing hesaid
toher.Helooked atherwithanoddglance: ithadthequality ofa
salute andofcompassion, together.
The controlling stock ofTaggart Transcontinental was leftto
James Taggart. Hewasthirty-four when hebecame President otthe
railroad. Dagny hadexpected theBoard ofDirectors toelect him,
butshehadnever been abletounderstand whytheydid itsoeagerly.
They talked about tradition, thepresident hadalways been theeldest
sonoftheTaggart family; they elected James Taggart inthesame
manner asthey refused towalk under aladder, topropitiate the
same kind offear.They talked about hisgiftof"making railroads
popular/’ his"good press,*’ his"Washington ability." Heseemed
unusually skillful atobtaining favors from theLegislature.
Dagny knew nothing about the field of"Washington ability" or
what suchanability implied. But itseemed tobenecessary, soshe.
dismissed itwith thethought thatthere weremany kinds ofwork
which were offensive, yetnecessary, such ascleaning sewers; some-
bodyhadtodo it,andJimseemed tolike it.
Shehadnever aspired tothepresidency; theOperating Depart-
ment washeronly concern. When shewent outonthe line, old
railroad men,whohated Jim, said,"There willalways beaTaggart
toruntherailroad,” looking atherasherfather hadlooked. Shewas
armed against Jimbytheconviction thathewasnotsmart enough to
harm therailroad toomuch andthatshewould always beable to
correct whatever damage hecaused.

Boyle andtheir friends wereamong theheaviest stockholders ofthe
project which Francisco dAncoma hadnamed theSanSebastian
Mines
Dagny wasnever able todiscover what influences prompted James
Taggart tobuild arailroad branch from Texas thewilderness
ofSanSebastian itseemed likely thathedidnot fknow ithimself
likeafieldwithout awindbreak heseemed opei$ toanycurrent,
andthefinalsumwasmade bychanceAfewamcing theDirectors
ofTaggart Transcontinental objected totheproject Thecompany
needed allitsresources torebuild theRioNorte lane, itcould not
56
doboth. ButJames Taggart wastheroad’s new president. Itwas
the firstyearofhisadministration. Hewon.
ThePeople’s Slate ofMexico waseager toco-operate, andsigned
acontract guaranteeing fortwohundred years theproperty right of
Taggart Transcontinental toitsrailroad line inacountry where no
property rights existed. Francisco d’Anconia hadobtained thesame
guaranty forhismines.
Dagny fought against thebuilding oftheSanSebastian Line.She
fought bymeans ofwhoever would listen toher;butshewasonly
anassistant intheOperating Department, tooyourfg, without author-
ity,andnobody listened.
Shewasunable, then orsince, tounderstand themotives ofthose
whodecided tobuild theline. Sitting asahelpless spectator, aminor-
itymember, atoneoftheBoard meetings, she feltastrange eva-
siveness inthe airoftheroom, inevery speech, inevery argument,
asiftherealreason oftheir decision were never stated, butclear to
everyone except herself.
They spoke about thefuture importance ofthetrade withMexico,
about arichstream offreight, about thelarge revenues assured to
theexclusive carrier ofaninexhaustible supply ofcopper. They
proved itbyciting Francisco d’Anconia's pastachievements. They
didnotmention anymineralogical facts about theSanSebastian
Mines. Few factswere available; theinformation which d’Anconia
hadreleased wasnotvery specific; butthey didnotseem toneed
facts.
They spoke atgreat length about thepoverty oftheMexicans and
their desperate need ofrailroads. “They’ve never hadachance.” “It
isourduty tohelpanunderprivileged nation todevelop. Acountry,
itseems tome, isitsneighbors’ keeper.”
She sat,listening, andshethought ofthemany branch lineswhich
Taggart Transcontinental hadhad toabandon; therevenues ofthe
great railroad hadbeen falling slowly formany years. Shethought
oftheominous need ofrepairs, ominously neglected over theentire
system. Their policy ontheproblem ofmaintenance wasnotapolicy,
butagame theyseemed tobeplaying with apiece ofrubber that
could bestretched alittle, then alittlemore.
“The Mexicans, itseems tome,areavery diligent people, crushed
bytheir primitive economy. How cantheybecome industrialized if
nobody lends them ahand?” “When considering aninvestment, we
should inmyopinion, take achance onhuman beings, rather than
onpurely material factors.”
Shethought ofanengine that layinaditch beside theRioNorte
Line, because asplice barhadcracked. Shethought ofthefivedays
when alltraffic wasstopped ontheRioNorte Line, because are-
taining wallhadcollapsed, pouring tonsofrock across thetrack.
“Since amanmust think ofthegood ofhisbrothers before he
thinks ofhisown, itseems tomethat anation must think ofits
neighbors before itthinks ofitself.”
Shethought ofanewcomer called EllisWyattwhom people were
beginning towatch, because hisactivity wasthe first trickle ofa
torrent ofgoods about toburstfrom thedying stretches ofColorado.
57
TheRioNorte Linewasbeing allowed torun itsway toafinal
collapse, justwhen itsfullest efficiency wasabout tobeneeded
andused.
“Material greed isn’teverything. There arenon-material ideals to
consider.” ”1confess toafeeling ofshame when 1think thatwe
own ahuge network ofrailways, while theMexican people have
nothing butoneortwoinadequate lines.” “The oldtheory ofeco-
nomic self-sufficiency hasbeen exploded long ago. llisimpossible
foronecountry toprosper inthemidst ofastarving world.”
Shethought that tomake Taggart Transcontinental what ithad
been once, longbetore hertime, every’ available rail,spike anddollar
wasneeded—andhowdesperately little ofitwas available.
They spoke also, atthesame session, inthesame speeches, about
theefficiency oftheMexican government thatheldcomplete control
ofeverything. Mexico hadagreat future, they said,andwould be-
come adangerous competitor inatewyears. “Mexico's got disci-
pline,” themen oftheBoard kept saying, with anote ofenvy in
their voices.
James Taggart let itbeunderstood—inunfinished sentences and
undefined hints—that hisfriends inWashington, whom henever
named, wished toseearailroad line built inMexico, thatsuch aline
would beofgreat help inmatters ofinternational diplomacy, that
thegood willofpublic opinion oftheworld would more thanrepay
Taggart Transcontinental for itsinvestment.
They voted tobuild theSanSebastian Line atacost ofthirty
million dollars.
When Dagny lefttheBoard room andwalked through theclean,
cold airofthestreets, sheheaid twowords repeated clearly, insis-
tently inthenumbed emptiness ofhermind: Getout .. .Getout .,.
Getout.
She listened, aghast. Thethought ofleaving 1'aggart Transconti-
nental didnotbelong among thethings shecould hold asconceiv-
able.She feltterror, notatthethought, butatthequestion ofwhat
hadmade herthink it.Sheshook herhead angrily; shetold herself
thatTaggart Transcontinental would nowneed hermore than ever.
Two oftheDirectors resigned; sodidtheVice-President mCharge
ofOperation. Hewasreplaced byatriend ofJames Taggart.
Steel railwas laidacross theMexican desert—while orders were
issued toreduce thespeed oftrains ontheRioNorte Line, be-
cause thetrack was shot.Adepot ofreinforced concrete, with
marble columns andmirrors, was built amidst thedustofanun-
paved square inaMexican village—while atrain oftank cars car-
rying oilwent hurtling down anembankment andintoablazing junk
pile,because arailhad splitontheRioNorte Line. EllisWyatt did
notwait forthecourt todecide whether theaccident wasanactof
God, asJames Taggart claimed. Hetransferred the^hipping ofhisoilto
thePhoenix -Durango, anobscure railroad which ^assmallandstrug-
gling, butstruggling well. Thiswastherocket th^tsentthePhoenix-
Durango onitsway.From then on, itgrew, asWyatt Oilgrew, as
factories grew tnnearby valleys—asaband ofr^lsand tiesgrew, at
58
therate oftwomiles amonth, across thescraggly fields ofMexi*
cancorn.
Dagny wasthirty-two years old,when shetoldJames Taggart that
shewould resign. ShehadruntheOperating Department forthe
pastthree years, without title, credit orauthority. Shewasdefeated
byloathing forthehours, thedays, thenights shehad towaste
circumventing theinterference ofJim’s friend whobore the titleof
Vice-President mCharge ofOperation Themanhadnopolicy, and
anydecision hemade wasalways hers, buthemade itonly afterhe
hadmade eveiy effort tomake itimpossible. What shedelivered to
herbrother wasanultimatum Hegasped, ”But, Dagny, youTe a
woman! Awoman asOpeiating Vice President? It'sunheard of!The

“Then 1’rnthrough,” sheanswered.
Shedidnotthink ofwhat shewould dowith therestofhei life.

lewcarloads came clattering down themountains from SanSebas-
tian, atlong intervals. The mines, saidFrancisco dAnconia, were
stillinthepiocess otdevelopment. Thedrain onTaggart Transconti-
nental hadnotstopped
Now she satatthedesk inher office, asshehad satformany
evenings, trying towork outtheproblem ofwhat branches could
save thesystem and inhowmany years.
TheRioNorte lme,when rebuilt, would redeem the rest.Asshe
looked atthesheets offigures announcing losses andmore losses,
shedidnotthink ofthelong, senseless agony tittheMexican venture.
Shethought ofatelephone call. Hank, canyousave us?Canyou
giveusrailontheshortest notice andthelongest credit possible?”
Aquiet, steady voice hadanswered. “Sure”
Thethought wasapoint ofsupport. Sheleaned over thesheets
ofpaper onherdesk, finding itsuddenly easier toconcentrate. There
wasone thing, atleast, thatcould becounted upon nottocrumble
when needed.
James Taggart crossed theanteroom ofDagny ’$office, stillholding
thekind ofconfidence hehad feltamong hiscompanions atthe
barroom halfanhour ago.When heopened herdoor, theconfidence
vanished. Hecrossed theroom toherdesk likeachild being dragged

Shewasback atherwork before thedoor hadclosed onJajnes
Taggart.
When shefinished, pushed thepapers aside andglanced up,the
skywasblack beyond thewindow, andthecityhadbecome aglow-
ingspread oflighted glass without masonry. Sherose reluctantly.
Sheresented thesmall defeat ofbeing tired, butsheknew thatshe
was, tonight.
Theouter office wasdarkandempty; her staffhadgone. Only
Eddie Willers was stillthere, athisdeskmhisglass partitioned en-
closure thatlooked likeacube oflight inacorner ofthelarge room.
Shewaved tohimonherwayout
Shedidnottake theelevator tothelobby ofthebuilding, butto
theconcourse oftheTaggart Terminal. Sheliked towalk through it
onherwayhome.
Shehadalways felt that theconcourse looked like atemple.
Glancing upatthedistant ceiling, shesawdimvaults supported by
giant granite columns, andthetopsofvastwindows gla/ed bydark-
ness.The vaulting held thesolemn peace ofacathedral, spread in
protection highabove therushing activity olmen.
Dominating theconcourse, butignored bythetravelers asahabit-
ualsight, stood astatue ofNathaniel Taggart, thefounder ofthe
iailroad. Dagny wastheonlyonewhoremained aware ofitandhad
never been able totake itforgranted. Tolook atthatstatue when-
ever shecrossed theconcourse, wastheonlyform atprayer she
knew.
Nathaniel Taggart hadbeen apenniless adventurer whohadcome
fromsomewhere inNewrEngland and built arailroad across aconti-
nent, inthedays ofthe first steel rails. Hisrailroad stillstood; his
battle tobuild ithaddissolved into alegend, because people pre-
ferred nottoundei stand itortobelieve itpossible.
Hewasamanwhohadnever accepted thecreed thatothers had
theright to.stophim.Hesethisgoalandmoved toward it,hisway
asstraight asoneofhis rails.Henever sought any loans, bonds,
subsidies, land grants orlegislative favors from thegovernment He
obtained money fiom themenwhoowned it,going from door to
door—from themahogany doors olbankers totheclapboard doors
oflonely farmhouses. Henever talked about thepublic good.He
merely toldpeople thattheywould make bigpiofits onhisrailroad,
hetoldthemwhyheexpected theprofits andhegave hisreasons.
Hehadgood reasons. Through allthegenerations that followed,
Taggart Transcontinental wasone olthe lew'railroads thatnever
went bankrupt andtheonlyonewhose controlling stock remained
inthehands ofthefounder's descendants.
inhislifetime, thename "Nat Taggart” wasnotfamous, hutnoto-

The cafeteria layunderground. Itwasalargeroom with walls of

like silver brocade. Ithadahigh ceiling, sparkling counters ofglass

There was arailroad worker whom Eddie Willers met attimes in

Eddie hadforgotten whether hehadeverasked theworker’s name

because theman’s clothes were rough andgrease-stained. Ilteman

Chapter IVTHEIMMOVABLE MOVERS
Motive power—thought Dagnv, looking upatthelaggart Building
inthetwilight -was itsfirstneed motive powti, tokeep thatbuild-
ingstanding, movement tokeep itimmovable Itdidnot reston
piles driven into granite, itrested ontheengines that lolled across
acontinent
She teltadimtouch ofanxiety Shewasbackfrom atriptothe
plant oftheUnited Locomotive Works inNew Jersey where she
hadgone toseethepresident ofthecompany mperson Shehad
learned nothing neither thereason forthedelays noranyindication
ofthedatewhen theDiesel engines would beproduced The presi
dent ofthecompany hadtalked toherfortwohours Butnone of
hisanswers hadconnected toanyofherquestions Hismanner had
conveyed apeculiar note ofcondescending reproach whenever she
attempted tomake theconversation specific, asifshewere giving
proof of illbreeding bybreaking some unwritten codeknown to
everyone else
Onherwaythrough theplant, shehadseenanenormous piece
ofmachinery leftabandoned inacorner ofthevard Ithadbeen a
precision machine toolonce, longago ofakind thatcould notbe
bought anywhere now Ithadnotbeenworn out ithadbeen rotted
byneglect, eaten byrustandtheblack dnppings ofadirty oilShe
hadturned herfaceaway from itAsight ofthatnature always
blinded herforaninstant bytheburst oftooviolent ananger She
didnotknow why, shecould notdefine herown feeling sheknew
only thatthere was, inherleeling, ascream ofprotest against injus
tice,andthat itwas aresponse tosomething much beyond anold
piece ofmachinery
The restofherstaffhadgonewhen sheentered theanteroom of
her office, butFddie Willers was stillthere, waiting lorherShe
knew atonce thatsomething hadhappened, bythewayhelooked
andthewayhefollowed hersilently intoherjnfhce
‘What’s thematter, Eddie7’
“McNamara quit”
Shelooked athimblankly “What doyou ijtean, quit7”
“Left Retired Went outofbusiness’’
“McNamara, ourcontractor 7’’
“Yes”

“But that’s impossible!”
“Iknow it.”
“What happened? Why?”
“Nobody knows.”
Taking hertime deliberately, sheunbuttoned hercoat, satdown
atherdesk, started topull offhergloves. Then shesaid,“Begin at
thebeginning, Lddie. Sitdown.”
liespoke quietly, butheremained standing. “Italked tohischief
engineer, long distance. The chiel engineer called from Cleveland,
totellus.That’s allhesaid.Heknew nothing else.”
“What didhesay?”
“ThatMcNamara hasclosed hisbusiness andgone.”
“Where?”
“Hedoesn’t know. Nobody knows.”
Shenoticed thatshewasholding withonehandiwoempty lingers
oftheglove ottheother, theglove half-removed andforgotten She
pulled itoffanddropped itonthedesk.
Kddie said,“He’s walked outonapileofcontracts thatareworth
afortune. Hehad awaiting listolclients forthenext three
years. ...”Shesaid nothing. Headded, hisvoice low. “Iwouldn’t
befrightened if 1could understand u. . . .Butathing that can't
have anypossible reason . .Sheicmained silent “Hewasthe
bestcontractor inthecountry”
They looked ateach other. What shewanted tosaywas,“Oh
God, Kddie!” Instead, hervoice even, shesaid.“Don't worry. We’ll
findanother contractoi fortheRioNorte Line”
Itwas latewhen she let!her office. Outside, onthesidewalk at
thedoor ofthebuilding, shepaused, looking atthestreets, She felt
suddenly empty ofenergy, ofpurpose, ofdesire, asifamotor had
crackled andstopped.
Afaintglowstreamed from behind thebuildings intothesky.the
iejection ofthousands ofunknown lights, theelectric breath ofthe
city.Shewanted torest.To rest, shethought, andtofindenjoy-
mentsomewhere
Herwork was allshehadorwanted. Butthere were times, like
tonight, when she feltthatsudden, peculiar emptiness, which was
notemptiness, butsilence, notdespair, butimmobility, asifnothing
within herwere destroyed, buteverything stood still.Then she felt
thewish tofind amoment's joyoutside, thewish tobeheld asa
passive spectator bysome work orsight ofgreatness. Nottomake
it,shethought, buttoaccept: nottobegin, buttorespond; notto
create, buttoadmire. 1need ittoletmegoon,shethought, because
joy isone’s fuel.
Shehadalways been—sheclosed bcieyes with afaint smile of
amusement andpain— themotive power ofherown happiness. For
once, shewanted tofeelherself carried bythepower ofsomeone
else’s achievement. Asmenonadark prairie liked toseethelighted

There wasonlyonething thatcould giveherthefeeling shewanted
68
toexperience tonight; itwastheonlyform ofenjoyment shehad
found. Sheturned toaphonograph andputonarecord ofthemusic
ofRichard Halley.
Itwas hisFourth Concerto, the lastwork hehad written. Hie
crash ofitsopening chords swept thesights ofthestreets awayfrom
hermind. HieConcerto wasagreat cryofrebellion. Itwasa“No”
flung atsome vastprocess oftorture, adenial ofsuffering, adenial
thatheld theagony ofthestruggle tobreak free.Thesounds weic like
avoice saying: There isnonecessity forpain—why, then, istheworst
pain reserved forthosewho willnotaccept itsnecessity?—wewho
hold theloveandthesecret ofjoy,towhat punishment havewe
been sentenced for it,andbywhom? . ,.Thesounds oftorture
became defiance, thestatement olagony became ahymn toadistant
vision forwhose sakeanything wasworth enduring, even this. Itwas
thesong ofrebellion— andofadesperate quest.
She sat still,hereyes closed, listening
Nooneknew whathadhappened toRichard Halley, orwhy.The
story ofhis lifehadbeen likeasummary written todamn greatness
byshowing theprice onepays for it.Ithadbeen aprocession of
years spent ingarrets andbasements, years thathadtaken thegray
tinge ofthewalls imprisoning amanwhose music overflowed with
violent color. Ithadbeen thegray olastruggle against long flights
ofunlighled tenement stairs, against frozen plumbing, against the
price ofasandwich inanill-smelling delicatessen store, against the
faces ofmenwho listened tomusic, their eyesempty. Ithadbeen a
struggle without therelief ofviolence, without therecognition of
finding aconscious enemy, withonly adeal wall tobatter, awallof
themost effective soundproofing, indifference, thatswallowed blows,
chords andscreams— abattle ofsilence, foramanwhocould give
tosounds agreater eloquence than theyhadever carried—the si-
lence ofobscurity, ofloneliness, ofthenights whensome rareorches-
traplayed oneothisworks andhelooked atthedarkness, knowing
that hissoulwent intrembling, widening circles from aradio tower
through the airofthe city, butthere were noreceivers tuned to
hear it.
“The music ofRichard Halley hasaquality oftheheroic. Ourage
hasoutgrown that stuff,” saidone critic. “The music ofRichard
Halley isoutofkeywithourtimes Ithasatone ofecstasy. Who
cares forecstasy nowadays?” saidanother.
His lifehadbeen asummary ofthe lives ofallthemenwhose
reward isamonument inapublic park ahundred years after the
timewhen areward canmatter—except thatRichard Halley didnot
diesoon enough. Helived toseethenight which, bytheaccepted
lawsofhistorv, hewasnotsupposed tosee.Hewasforty-three years
oldand itwastheopening night ofPhaethon, anopera hehad
written attheageoftwenty-four. Hehadchanged theancient Greek
myth tohisownpurpose andmeaning: Phaethon, theyoung sonof
Helios, who stole hisfather schariot and, inambitious audacity,
attempted todrive thesunacross thesky, didnotperish, ashe
perished inthemyth; inHalley's opera, PhaCthon succeeded. The
opera hadbeenperformed then, nineteen years ago,andhadclosed
69
afteroneperformance, tothesound ofbooing and catcalls. That
night, Richard Halley hadwalked thestreets ofthecity tilldawn,
trying tofindananswer toaquestion, which hedidnot find*
Onthenightwhen theopera waspresented again, nineteen years
later, the lastsounds ofthemusic crashed into thesounds ofthe
greatest ovation theopera house hadever heard. Theancient walls
could notcontain it,thesounds ofcheering burst through tothe
lobbies, tothestairs, tothestreets, totheboywhohadwalked those
streets nineteen years ago.
Dagny was intheaudience onthenight oftheovation. Shewas
oneofthefewwhohadknown themusic ofRichard Halley much
earlier, butshehadnever seen him.Shesawhimbeing pushed out
onthestage, sawhimfacing theenormous spread ofwaving arms
andcheering heads. Hestood without moving, atall,emaciated man
withgraying hair.Hedidnotbow, didnotsmile; hejuststood there,
looking atthecrowd. Hisfacehadthequiet, earnest look ofaman
staring ataquestion.
‘The music otRichard Halley,” wrote acritic nextmorning, 'be-
longs tomankind. Itistheproduct andtheexpression ofthegreat-
nessofthepeople.” “There isaninspiring lesson,” said aminister,
“inthe lifeofRichard Halley. Hehashadaterrible struggle, but
what docs thatmatter? Itisproper, itisnoble thatheshould have
endured suffering, injustice, abuse atthehands ofhisbrothers -in
order toenrich their livesandteach them toappreciate thebeauty
ofgreat music.”
Onthedayafter theopening, Richard Halley retired.
Hegavenoexplanation. Hemerely told hispublisher that his
career wasover.Hesoldthem therights tohisworks foramodest
sum, eventhough heknew that hisroyalties would now bring him
afortune. *Hewent away, leaving noaddress. Itwaseight years ago:
noonehadseenhim since.
Dagny listened totheFourth Concerto, herheadthrown back, her
eyes closed. She layhall-stretched across thecorner olacouch, her
body relaxed and still; buttension stressed theshape ofhermouth
onhermotionless face, asensual shape drawn inlines oflonging.
Aftei awhile, sheopened hereyes. Shenoticed thenewspaper
shehadthrown down onthecouch. Shereached for itabsently, to
turn thevapid headlines outofsight.Thepaper fellopen. Shesaw
thephotograph ofafacesheknew, andtheheading ofastory. She
slammed thepages shutand flungthem aside.
ItwasthefaceofFrancisco d’Anconia. Theheading said thathe
hadarrived inNewYork. What ofit?—she thought. Shewould not
have toseehim.Shehadnotseenhim foryears.
She satlooking atthenewspaper onthefloor. Don’t read it.she
thought; don't look atit.Buttheface,shethought, hadnotchanged.
How could afaceremain thesamewhen everything elsewasgone?
Shewished theyhadnotcaught apicture ofhimwhpn hesmiled.
That kind ofsmile didnotbelong inthepages ofanewspaper. It
wasthesmile ofamanwho isable tosee,toknow|md tocreate
theglory ofexistence. Itwasthemocking, challenging smile ofa
70
brilliant intelligence- Don’t read it,shethought; notnow— notto
thatmusic—oh,nottothatmusic!
Shereached forthepapci andopened it.
The story said that Softer Francisco d’Anconia hadgranted an
interview tothepress inhissuite attheWayne-Falkland Hotel. He
said thathehadcome toNewYork fortwoimportant reasons: a
hatchcck girlattheCubClub, andtheliverwurst atMoe’s Delicates-
senonThird Avenue, Hehadnothing tosayabout thecoming di-
vorce tiialofMrandMrs. Gilbert Vail. Mrs. Vail, aladyofnoble
breeding andunusual loveliness, hadtaken ashot ather distin-
guished young husband, some monlhs ago, publicly declaring that
shewished togetridofhim forthesake ofherlover, Francisco
d’Anconia. Shehadgiven tothepress adetailed account ofher
secret romance, including adescription ofthenight oflastNew
Year’s Evewhich shehadspent atd’Anconia’s villa intheAndes.
Herhusband hadsurvived theshotandhadsued fordivorce. She
hadcountered with asuit forhalfofherhusband’s millions, and
with arecital ofhisprivate lifewhich, she said,made hers look
innocent. Allofthathadbeen splashed over thenewspapers for
weeks. ButSenor d’Anconia hadnothing tosayabout it,when the
reporters questioned him.Would hedeny Mrs. Vail’s story, they
asked. “Inever deny anything,” heanswered. The reporters had
been astonished byhissudden arrival intown; theyhadthought that
hewould notwish tobethere justwhen theworst ofthescandal
wasabout toexplode onthefront pages. Buttheyhadbeenwrong.
Francisco d’Anconia added onemorecomment tothereasons for
hisairival ”1wanted towitness thefarce,” hesaid.
Dagny letthepaper sliptothefloor. She sat,bent over, herhead
onherarms. Shedidnotmove, butthestrands ofhair, hanging
down toheiknees, trembled insudden joltsonce inawhile.
Thegreat chords oiHalley’s music went on. filling theroom, pierc-

Heslumped sidewise over thearmofthechairandcaught sight
ofaclock onadistant building: itwastwenty minutes pastnoon.
Through theopen door ofthebedroom, heheard Betty Pope
washing herteeth inthebathroom beyond. Her girdle layonthe

wasaladed pink, withbroken strands ofrubber.
“Hurry up,willyou?” hecalled irritably.kTve gottodress.”

Theproposal which theypassed wasknown asthe“Anti-dog-eat-
dogRule.” When theyvoted tor it,themembers oftheNational
Alliance ofRailroads satinalarge hallmthedeepening twilight of
alateautumn evening anddidnotlook atoneanother.
IheNational Alliance olRaiiioads wasanorganization termed,
itwasclaimed, toprotect thewelfare oltherailroad industry. This
was tobeachieved bydeveloping methods ofco-operation fora
common purpose: thiswas tobeachieved bythepledge olevery
member tosubordinate hisown interests tothose oftheindustry asa
whole, theinterests oftheindustry asawhole were tobedetermined
byamajority vote,andeverymember wascommitted toabide byany
decision themajor itychose tomake.
“Members olthesame protession orofthesame industry should
stick together,” theorganizers ottheAlliance had said.“We allhave
thesame problems, thesame interests, thesame enemies. Wewaste
ourenergy fighting oneanother, instead ofpresenting acommon
front totheworld.Wecan allglowandprosper together, itwepool
our efforts." “Against whom isthisAlliance being organized?” a
skeptic hadasked. Theanswet hadbeen: “Why, itsnot ‘against'
anybody. But ityouwant toput itthatway,why, it’sagainst shippers
orsupply manufacturers oranyone whomight trytotakeadvantage
ofus.Against whom isanyunion organized?" “That's what 1wonder
about,” theskeptic had said.
When theAnti-dog-eal-dog Rulewasoffered tothevote ofthe
fullmembership oftheNational Alliance ofRailroads atitsannual
meeting, itwasthe lirslmention ofthisRule inpublic. But allthe
members hadheard ofit; ithadbeen discussed privately foralong
time,andmore insistently inthefastfewmonths. Themenwho sat
inthelarge hallofthemeeting were thepresidents oftherailroads.
They didnot like theAnti-dog-cat-dog Rule; theyhadhoped it
would never bebrought up.Butwhen itwasbrought up,theyvoted
for it.
Norailroad wasmentioned byname inthespeeches thatpreceded
thevoting. Thespeeches dealt only with thepublic welfare. Itwas
said thatwhile thepublic welfare wasthreatened byshortages of
transportation, railroads were destroying oneanother through vicious
75
competition, on“the brutal policy otdog-eat-dog ”While there ex
isted blighted aieas where railservice hadbeen discontinued, there
existed atthesame time large regions wheie twoormore railroads
werecompeting foratraffic barely sufficient forone Itwassaid that
there were great opportunities foryounger railroads intheblighted
areas While itwastrue thatsuch areas offered littleeconomic mcen
tive atpresent, apublic spirited railroad, itwassaidwould under
take toprovide transportation forthestruggling inhabitants since
theprime purpose ofaraihoad waspublic service notprolit
TTien itwassaid that large established railroad systems were es

“Sitdown,MrWyatt,” shesaid, smiling
“Itwon’t benecessary” Hedidnotsmile “idon’t hold long

Slowly, taking hertimebyconscious intention, she satdown and
leaned back, looking athim.
'‘Well?'’ sheasked.
“Icame toseeyoubecause 1understand you’re theonlyone
who's gotanybrains inthisrotten outfit.”
“What can Idoforyou?”
“You can listen toanultimatum.” Hespoke distinctly, giving an
unusual clarity toevery syllable. “Iexpect Taggart Transcontinental,
ninemonths from now. torun trains inColorado asmybusiness
requires them toherun. Ifthesnide stunt youpeople perpetrated

“No. Ihave nointerest indiscussions and intentions. 1expect

Shesaid quietly, “Iunderstand.”
“Ishan’t waste lime proving toyouwhyyou'd better takemy

Sohere ismyultimatum: itisnow inyourpower todestroy me; I
mayhave togo;but if1go, I’llmake sure that Itake alltherestof
youalong withme.”
Somewhere within her,under thenumbness thatheldher stillto
receive thelashing, she feltasmall point ofpain, hotlikethepain
ofscalding. Shewanted totellhimoftheyears shehadspent looking
formensuch ashetowork with; shewanted toteUhim that his
enemies were hers, thatshewasfighting thesame bat$e; shewanted
tocrytohim; I'mnotoneofthem! Butsheknew (hatshecould
notdo it.Shebore theresponsibility forTaggart Transcontinental
and foreverything done initsname; shehadno|ight tojustify
herself now.
Sitting straight, herglance assteady andopen ashiisheanswered
evenly, “You willgetthetransportation youneed, Mr.Wyatt,”
Shesawafaint hintofastonishment inhisface; thiswasnotthe
82
manner ortheanswer hehadexpected; perhaps itwaswhat shehad
notsaid thatastonished himmost: thatsheoffered nodefense, no
excuses. Hetook amoment tostudy her silently. Then hesaid, his
voice lesssharp:
“All right.Thank you.Good day/’
Sheinclined herhead.Hebowed and lefttheoffice.

Reardon satbehind hisdesk. Hiscold, blueeyesmade twohori-
zontal cutsacross thegaunt planes ofhisface: theyremained hori-
zontal, impassively half-closed: hesaidevenly, without emphasis:
“I'lldo it.'1
Dagny leaned backmherchair. Theshort sentence wasashock.
Itwasnotmerely relief: itwasthesudden realization thatnothing

hewassaying.
“Don’t show thatyou're relieved"Hisvoice wasmocking. “Not

\ealing smile. “Imight think that IholdTaggart Transcontinental in
mypower."
“You know that,anyway"
"1doAnd 1intend tomake youpayforit."
“Iexpect to.Howmuch?"
“Twenty dollars extra pertunonthebalance oltheorder deliv-

“Pretty sleep. Hank. Isthatthebest priceyoucangiveme?"
“No. But that's theonePmgoing toget. Icould asktwice that
andyou’d pay it."
“Yes, lwould. Andyoucould. Butyouwon’t."
“Why won't l?"
“Because youneed tohave theRioNorte Line built. It'syour

Hechuckled. “That's right 1liketodealwithsomebody whohas
noillusions about getting favors."
“Doyouknow whatmademefeel relieved, when youdecided to
takeadvantage ofit?"
“What?"
“That 1wasdealing, foronce, withsomebody whodoesn’t pretend

Hissmile hadadiscernible quality now: itwasenjoyment. “You
always play itopen, don’t you?" heasked.
;Tve never noticed youdoing otherwise."
“Ithought 1wastheonlyonewhocould afford to."
“I’m notbroke, inthatsense. Hank."
“Ithink I’mgoing tobreak yousome day—inthatsense”

andshrugged—“afterwards, theywon’t matter.”
“That’s right.They won’t.When 1heard about thatAnti-dog-eat-
dogbusiness, itmademesick.Butdon’t worry about thegoddamn

faceandvoice remained calm.“You and Iwillalways bethere to

up:hesaid, pacing theoffice, “Colorado isn’tgoing tobestopped.
You’ll pull itthrough. ThenDanConway willbeback, andothers.
Allthatlunacy istemporary. Itcan’t last. It’sdemented, so ithasto

Shewatched his tallfigure moving across the office. The office
suited him; itcontained nothing butthefewpieces offurniture he
needed, allolthem harshly simplified down totheir essential pur-
pose. allofthem exorbitantly expensive inthequality ofmaterials
andtheskillofdesign. Theroom looked likeamotor—amotor held
within theglass caseofbroad windows. Butshenoticed oneaston-
ishing detail, avase otjade thatstood ontopofafiling cabinet. The
vasewasasolid, dark green stone carved into plain surfaces; the
texture ofitssmooth curses provoked anirresistible desire totouch
it. Itseemed startling inthat office, incongruous with thesternness
oftherest: itwasatouch olsensuality.
“Colorado isagreat place,' hesaid. “It'sgoing tobethegreatest

“Thewayyoudon't react aseverybody elsedoesnowadays.”
“Still, Imustadmit that torthetimebeing you’re themost impor-

“Don’t yousuppose Iknow it?”
“So Ican't understand whyJim—”Shestopped
“—tries hisbest toharmmybusiness? Because your brother Jim

“He is.But it’smore than that. There’s something worse than

Shelooked athim*unable tounderstand. Buthewaslooking past

ingafeeling offundamental guilt. Butshe feltavague apprehension
which shecould notdefine, thesuggestion thattherewassomething
ofgrave consequence inwhatever hadmade himsay it,something
dangerous tohim.Hehadnotsaid itcasually. Butthere hadbeen
nofeeling inhisvoice, neither pleanorshame. Hehadsaid itindif-
ferently, asastatement offact.
Then, asshewatched him, theapprehension vanished. Hewas
looking athismillsbeyond thewindow; there wasnoguilt inhis
face,nodoubt, nothing butthecalm ofaninviolate self-confidence
“Dagny,” hesaid, “whatevei weare, it’swewhomove theworld
and it’swewho’ll pull itthrough”
Chapter VTHECLIMAX OFTHED'ANCONIAS
Thenewspaper wasthe firstthing shenoticed Itwasclutched tightly
inEddie's hand, asheentered heroffice. Sheglanced upathislace:
itwastense andbewildered
“Dagny, aieyouvervbusv?”
Why?”
“Iknow thatyoudon’t liketotalkabout himButthere's some
thing here 1think youought tosee.”
Sheextended herhand silently foithenewspaper.
The storyonthefrontpageannounced thatupon taking over the
SanSebastian Mines, thegovernment ofthePeople’s State ofMexico
haddiscovered that theywere worthless— blatantly, totally, hope-
lessly vyorthless. There wasnothing tojustify thefiveyears ofwork
andthemillions spent, nothing butempty excavations, laboriously
cut.Thefewttaces ofcopper were notworth theeffort ofextracting
themNogreat deposits ofmetal existed orcould beexpected to
exist there, andthere werenoindications thatcould have permitted
anyone tobedeluded. Thegovernment ofthePeople’s State of
Mexico washolding emergency sessions about their discovery, inan
uproar ofindignation, they feltthattheyhadbeen cheated.
Watching her,Eddie knew thatDagny satlooking atthenewspa-
perlong after shehadfinished reading. Heknew thathehadbeen
right tofeelahintoffear,eventhough hecould not tellwhat fright-
enedhimabout that story
Hewaited. Sheraised herhead Shedidnotlook31him.Hereyes

atagreat distance.
Hesaid, hisvoice low,“Franctsco isnotafool. Vjfhatever elsehe
may be,nomatter what depravity he’ssunk to—add I’vegiven up
trying tofigure outwhy— heisnotafool,Hecouldn’t havemade a
mistake ofthiskind. Itisnotpossible. 1don’t understand it“
“I’m beginning to.”
Shesatup,jolted upright byasudden movement thatranthrough
herbody likeashudder. She said:
“Phone him attheWayne-Falkland and tellthebastard that 1

“Dagny,” hesaid sadly, reproachfully, “it’s Frisco d’Anconia.”
“Itwas.”
* +
Shewalked through theearly twilight ofthe city streets tothe
Wayne-Falkland Hotel. ‘He says, anytuneyouwish,” Eddie had
told her.The first lights appeared inalew'windows highunder the
clouds. Theskyscrapers looked likeabandoned lighthouses sending
teeble, dying signals outintoanempty seawhere noshipsmoved
anylonger.Afewsnowflakes came down, pastthedarkwindows of
empty stoics, tomeltmthemud ofthesidewalks. Astring ofred
lanterns cutthestreet, going oftintothemurky distance.
Shewondered whyshe feltthatshewanted torun,thatsheshould
berunning: no,notdown this street: down agreen hillside inthe
blazing suntotheroadontheedge oftheHudson, atthefoot of
theTaggart estate. That wasthewayshealways ranwhen Eddie
yelled, “It’s Frisco d’Ancoma’” andtheyboth flewdown the hillto
thecarappioaching ontheroadbelow
Hewastheonlv guest whose arrival wasanevent intheir child-
hood, then biggest e\cnt. Iherunning tomeethimhadbecome part
olacontest among thethree olthem. There wasabirch treeonthe
hillside, halfway between theroadandthehouse: Dagny andEddie
tried togetpast thetree, before Francisco could raceupthe hillto
meet them.On allthemany days olhisarrivals, inallthemany
summers, theynever reached thebirch tree: Francisco reached itfirst
andstopped themwhen hewasway past it.Francisco always won,
ashealways woneveiy thing.
Hisparents weie oldtnends oftheTaggart family. Hewasan
onlysonandhewasbeing brought upallover theworld; hisfather,
itwas said,wanted him toconsider theworld ashisfuture domain.
Dagny andEddie could never becertain otwhere hewould spend
hiswinter: butonce ayear, every summer, astern South American
tutor brought himforamonth totheTaggart estate.
Francisco found itnatural that theTaggart children should be
chosen ashiscompanions: theywere thecrown heirs ofTaggart
Transcontinental, ashewasofd’Anconia Copper. “We aretheonly
aristocracy left intheworld— thearistocracy ofmoney,” hesaid to
Dagny once,when hewasfourteen. “It's theonly real aristocracy,
ifpeople understood what itmeans, which they don’t.”
Hehad acaste system ofhisown. tohim, theTaggart children
were notJimandDagny, butDagny andEddie. Heseldom volun-
teered tonotice Jim’s existence. Eddie asked himonce, “Francisco,
you’re some kind ofvery high nobility, aren’t you?”Heanswered,
“Not yet.Thereason myfamily haslasted forsuch alongtime is
thatnone ofushaseverbeen permitted tothink heisbom ad’Ait-

After awhile, Mrs.Taggart began toworry anddecided toinvesti-
gate.Shenever learned howhehadmanaged toby-pass allthechild-
labor laws, butshefound Francisco working—byanunofficial deal
with thedispatcher—asacallboyforTaggart Transcontinental, at
adivision point tenmiles away. Thedispatcher wasstupefied byher
personal visit;hehadnoidea that hiscallboywasahouse guest of
the Taggarts. Theboywasknown tothelocal railroad crews as
Frankie, andMrs.Taggart preferred nottoenlighten them about his
fullname. Shemerely explained thathewasworking without his
parents' permission andhad toquit atonce.The dispatcher was
sorry tolosehim; Frankie, hesaid,wasthe bCvSt callboytheyhad
ever had. “I’dsure liketokeephim on.Maybe wecouldmake a
deal with hisparents?" hesuggested. *Tm afraid not,” saidMrs,
Taggart faintly.
"Francisco.” sheasked, when shebrought himhome, "what would
your father sayabout this, itheknew0”
”Mv lather would askwhether Iwasgood atthejobornotThat's
allhe'dwant toknow."
"Come now,Fmserious”
Francisco waslooking atherpolitely, hiseouiteous manner sug-
gesting centuries ofbreeding anddrawing rooms; butsomething in
hiseyesmade herfeeluncertain about thepoliteness. "Iastwinter,”
heanswered, "Ishipped outasacabin boyonacargo steamer that
carried d'Anconia copper. Mylather looked toimeforthree months,
butthat's allheaskedmewhen lcame back”
"So that’showyouspend >oui winters?” saidJunTaggart. Jim's
smile had atouch olliiumph, thetriumph otfinding cause tofeel
contempt
"That was lastwinter.” Francisco answered pleasantly, withno
change intheinnocent, casual toneofhisvoice. "The winter before
last lspent inMadiid, atthehome oftheDuke otAlba.”
"Why didyouwant towork onarailroad/” asked Dagny.
They stood looking ateachother herswasaglance ofadmiration,
hisofmockery; but itwasnotthemockery ofmalice—itwasthe
laughter ofasalute.
"To learn what's it'slike, Slug,” heanswered, "and totellyou
that I'vehadajobwith Taggart Transcontinental befotc youdid.”
Dagny andluldie spent their winters trying tomaster somenew
skill, inolder toastonish Francisco andbeat him, foronce. They
never succeeded. When theyshowed himhow tohitaballwith a
bat,agame hehadnever played before, hewatched them forafew
minutes, then said, ‘ithink 1gettheidea Letmetry.”Hetook the
batandsent theball flying over aline otoak tiees farattheend
otthe field.
When Jimwasgiven amotorboat forhisbirthday, they allstood
ontheriver landing, watching thelesson, while aninstructor showed
Jimhow torun it.None ofthem hadeverdriven amotorboat before.
Thesparkling white craft, shaped likeabullet, keptstaggering clum-
silyacross thewater, itswake alongrecord ofshivering, itsmotor
choking withhiccoughs, while theinstructor, sealed beside him,kept
seizing thewheel outofJim's hands. Fornoapparent reason, Jim
91
raised hishead suddenly andyelled atFrancisco, “Do>outhinkyou
cando itanybetter 7”“1cando it”‘Try it1”
When theboatcame back and itstwooccupants stepped out,
Francisco slipped behind thewheel “Wait amoment,” hesaid to
theinstructor, whoremained onthelanding “Letmetake alook

Shenoticed thepirticular quality ofFranciscos smil$ again, one
night*when shesatwithhimandEddie atabonfire theyhadbuilt in
thewoods. Theglowofthelireenclosed them within afence ofbroken,
moving strips thatheld pieces oftree trunks, branches anddistant
stars. She feltasiftherewere nothing beyond thatfence, nothing but
black emptiness, with thehintofsome breath -stopping, frightening
promise .,.likethefuture. Butthefuture, shethought, would be
likeFrancisco’s smile, therewasthekeytoit,theadvance warning
ofitsnature— inhisface inthefirelight under thepinebranches—
andsuddenly she feltanunbearable happiness, unbearable because
itwastoo fullandshehadnoway toexpress it.Sheglanced at
Eddie. Hewaslooking atFrancisco, Insome quietwayofhisown,
Eddie feltasshedid.
“Why doyou likeFrancisco?” sheasked himweeks later,when
Francisco wasgone.
Eddie looked astonished; ithadnever occurred tohim that the
teeling could bequestioned. Hesaid,“Hemakes mefeelsafe.”
She said,“Hemakesmeexpect excitement anddanger.”
Francisco wassixteen, nextsummer, thedaywhen shestood alone
withhimonthesummit ofacliffbytheriver, their shorts andshirts
torn intheirclimb tothetop.They stood looking down theHudson;
theyhadheard thatonclear daysonecould seeNewYork inthe
distance. Buttheysawonly ahazemade ofthree different kinds of
lightmerging together: theriver, theskyandthesun.
Sheknelt onarock, leaning forward, trying tocatchsome hintof
thecity, thewindblowing herhairacioss hereyes.Sheglanced back
over hershoulder ~andsaw thatFrancisco wasnotlooking atthe
distance, hestood looking ather. Itwasanodd glance, intent and
unsmiling. Sheremained still (oramoment, herhands spread flat
ontherock, herarms tensed tosupport theweight ofherbody;
inexplicably, hisglance made heraware ofherpose, ofhershoulder
showing tluough thetorn shirt, ofherlong, scratched, sunburned
legsslanting from thelock totheground. Shestood upangrily and
backed away from him.And while throwing herhead up,resentment
inhereyes tomeet thesternness inhis,while feeling certain that
hiswasaglance ofcondemnation and hostility, sheheard herself
asking him, atone ofsmiling defiance inhervoice:
"What doyou likeabout me?”
Helaughed; shewondered, aghast, what hadmade hersay it.He
answered, “There’s what 1likeabout you,” pointing totheglittering
railsoftheTaggart station inthedistance,
“It's notmine,” shesaid, disappointed.
“What 1like isthat it’sgoing tobe.”
Shesmiled, conceding hisvictory bybeing openly delighted. She
didnotknow whyhehadlooked athersostrangely; butshe felt
thathehadseensome connection, which shecould notgrasp, be-
tween herbody andsomething within herthatwould giveherthe
strength torulethose railssome day.
Hesaidbrusquely, “Let's sec ifwecanseeNewYork,” andjerked
herbythearm totheedge ofthe cliff.Shethought thathedidnot
notice thathetwisted herarm inapeculiar way, holding itdown
along thelength ofhisside; itmade herstand pressed against him,
95
andshe feltthewarmth ofthesun intheskinofhislegs against
hers.They looked faroutinto thedistance, buttheysawnothing
ahead except ahaze oflight.
When Francisco left, thatsummer, shethought that hisdeparture
was likethecrossing ofafrontier which ended hischildhood: hewas
tostart college, that fall.Her turnwould come next. vShe feltan
eager impatience touched bytheexcitement offear; as ithehad
leaped intoanunknown danger. Itwas likethemoment, years ago,
when shehadseenhimdive firstfrom arock into theHudson, had
Seenhimvanish under theblack water andhadstood, knowing that
hewould reappear inaninstant andthat itwould thenbeherturn
tofollow
Shedismissed thetear; dangeis, toFrancisco, were merely oppor
tunities foranother biilliant performance: there werenobattles he
amid lose,noenemies tobeat him.And then shethought ofa
remark shehadheard afewyears earlier. Itwasastrange remark -
and itwasstrange thatthewords hadremained inhermind, even
though shehadthought them senseless atthetime.Themanwho
said itwasanoldprofessor ofmathematics, afriend ofherfather,
whocame totheir country house torjust thatone visit.Sheliked
hisface,andshecould stillseethepeculiar sadness inhiseyeswhen
hesaid toherfather oneevening, siUing ontheterrace inthefading
light, pointing toFrancisco's figure inthegarden, "Ihatboy isvul-
nerable. Hehastoogreat acapacity forjoy.What willhedowith
itinaworld where there’s solittle occasion forit?"
Francisco went toagreatAmerican school, which hisfather had
chosen lorhimlong ago. Itwasthemost distinguished institution of
learning leftintheworld, thePatrick Henry University otCleveland.
Hedidnotcome tovisitherinNewYork, thatwinter, eventhough
hewasonlyanight’s journey away They didnotwrite toeach other,
theyhadnever done it.Butsheknew thathewould come back to
thecountry foronesummer month
There were afewtimes, that winter, when she feltanundefined
apprehension: theprofessor’s words kept returning tohermind, as
awarning which shecould notexplain. Shedismissed them.When
shethought ofFrancisco, she feltthesteadying assurance thatshe
would have another month asanadvance against thefuture, asa
proof thattheworld shesawahead was real,eventhough itwasnot
theworld otthose around her.
"Hi, Slug!"
"Hi, Frisco!"
Standing onthehillside, inthe firstmoment ofseeing himagain,
shegrasped suddenly thenature ofthatworld which they, together,
held against allothers. Itwasonlyaninstant’s paused she felther
cotton skirt beating inthewind against herknees, fellthesunon
hereyelids, andtheupward thrust ofsuchanimmense relief that
sheground herfeet intothegrass under hersandals,) because she
thought shewould nse. weightless, through thew<ml.
Itwasasudden sense offreedom andsafety— because sherealized
thatsheknew nothing about theevents ofhis life,haditever known

Francisco stopped, looked atherandslapped herfac$
What she teltwascontained inasingle instant, while theground

rocked under her feet, inasingle blast ofemotion within her.She
knew thatshewould have killed anyother person who struck her,
she felttheviolent furywhich would have given herthestrength for
it—and asviolent apleasure thatFrancisco haddone it.She felt
pleasure Irom thedull,hotpain inhercheek andfrom thetaste of
blood inthecorner ofhermouth. She feltpleasure inwhat she
suddenly grasped about him,about herself andabout hismotive.
Shebraced herfeettostop thedi/ziness, sheheldherhead straight
andstood facing him intheconsciousness ofanewpower, feeling
herself hisequal forthe firsttime, looking athimwith amocking
smile oftuumph.
“Did 1huityouasmuch asthat'**' sheasked.
Helooked astonished; thequestion andthesmile were notthose
ofachild, lieanswered, “Yes- -if itpleases you.”
“Itdoes.”
“Don't everdothat again. Don't crack jokes ofthatkind.”
“Don’t beafool.Whatever made youthink that 1cared about

“When yougrow up,you'llundo stand what sortofunspeakable
thingyousaid.”
“Iunderstand itnow.”
Heturned abruptly, took out hishandkerchief anddipped itin
thewater oftheliver “Come here,” heordered.
Shelaughed, stepping back 'Oh, no. Iwant tokeep itasitis. I
hope itswells terribly 1like it”
Helooked atherloralongmoment Hesaid slowly, very ear-
nestly, “Dagny. you’re wonderful.”
“Ithought thatyoualways thought so.”sheanswered, hervoice
insolently casual.
When shecame home, shetoldhermother thatshehadcuther
lipbyfalling against arock. Itwastheonlyhesheever told.She
didnotdo ittoprotect iranusco, shedid itbecause she felt, for
some reason which shecould notdefine, that theincident wasa
secret tooprecious toshare.
Nextsummer, when Francisco came, shewassixteen Shestarted
running down the hilltomeet him, butstopped abruptly. Hesaw it,
stopped, andtheystood foramoment, looking ateach other across
thedistance ofalong, green slope Itwashewhowalked uptoward
her,walked very- slowly, while shestood waiting.
When heapproached, shesmiled innocently, asifunconscious of
anycontest intended orwon.
“You might like toknow,” shesaid, “that 1have ajobonthe
railroad. Night operator atRockdale”
Helaughed “All right, Taggart Transcontinental, now it'sarace.
Let's seewho’ll dogreater honor, you— toNatTaggart, or 1—to
Sebastian d’Anconia."
Tltal winter, shestripped her lifedown tothebright simplicity of
ageometrical drawing: atew straight lines—toandfrom theengi-
neering college inthecityeach day, toandfromherjobatRockdale
Station each night—andtheclosed circle ofherroom, aroom littered
99
with diagrams ofmotors, blueprints ofsteel structures, and rail-
road timetables.
Mrs.Taggart watched herdaughter inunhappy bewilderment. She
could have forgiven alltheomissions, butone:Dagny showed no
signofinterest inmen,noromantic inclination whatever. Mrs,Tag-
gartdidnotapprove ofextremes; shehadbeenprepared tocontend
withanextreme oftheopposite kind, ifnecessary; shefound herself
thinking that thiswasworse. She feltembarrassed when shehadto
admit thatherdaughter, atseventeen, didnothave asingle admirer.
“Dagny andFrancisco d'Anconia?” shesaid, smiling ruefully, in
answer tothecuriosity ofherfriends. “Oh no. it'snotaromance,
ft’saninternational industrial cartel ofsome kind. That’s allthey
seem tocareabout.”
Mrs. Taggart heard James sayoneevening, inthepresence of
guests, apeculiar tone ofsatisfaction inhisvoice, “Dagny, even
though youwerenamed after her.you really lookmore likeNat
Taggart than like that firstDagny Taggart, thefamous beauty who
was hiswife.” Mrs.Taggart didnotknow which otfended hermost:
thatJames said itorthatDagny accepted ithappily asacompliment.
Shewould never have achance, thought Mrs. Taggart, toform
some conception ofherowndaughter. Dagny wasonly afigure hur-
rying inandoutoftheapartment, aslim figure inaleather jacket,
with araised collar, ashort skirtandlongshow-girl legs.Shewalked,
cutting across aroom, with amasculine, straight-line abruptness, but
shehadapeculiar grace ofmotion thatwas swift, tense andoddly,
challengingty feminine.
Attimes, catching aglimpse ofDagny’s face, Mrs.Taggart caught
anexpression which shecould notquite define: itwasmuch more
than gaiety, itwasthelook ofsuchanuntouched purity ofenjoyment
thatshefound itabnormal, too:noyoung girlcould besoinsensitive
tohave discovered nosadness inlife.Herdaughter, sheconcluded,
wasincapable ofemotion.
“Dagny,*’ sheasked once, “don’t youeverwant tohave agood
time?’’ Dagny looked atherincredulously andanswered, “What do
youthink I’mhaving?”
Thedecision togiveherdaughter aformal debut costMrs.Taggart
agreat dealofanxious thought. Shedidnotknow whether shewas
introducing toNewYork society MissDagny Taggart oftheSocial
Register orthenight operator ofRockdale Station; shewasinclined
tobelieve itwasmore truly this last;andshe feltcertain thatDagny
would reject theideaofsuchanoccasion, Shewasastonished when
Dagny accepted itwith inexplicable eagerness, foronce likeachild.
Shewasastonished again, when shesawDagny dressed forthe
party. Itwasthe firstfeminine dress shehadeverworn-fa gown of
white chiffon withahuge skirt thatfloated likeacloud, hfrs,Taggart
hadexpected hertolook likeapreposterous contrast. Ddgny looked
likeabeauty. Sheseemed both older andmore radiantly innocent
than usual; standing infront ofthemirror, sheheldherlead asNat
Taggart’s wifewould have held it.
“Dagny,” Mrs.Taggart saidgently, reproachfully, “do$ouseehow
beautiful youcanbewhen youwant to?’
100
'Yes,” saidDagny, without anyastonishment
Theballroom oftheWayne-Falkland Hotel hadbeen decorated
under Mrs Taggart's direction shehadanartist’s taste, andthe
setting ofthatevening washermasterpiece “Dagny, there arethings
Iwould likeyoutolearn tonotice,” shesaid, “lights, colors, flowers*
music Ihey arenotasnegligible asyoumight think” “I’ve nevet
thought they’re negligible,’Dagny answered happily Foronce,Mrs
Iaggarl feltabond between them Dagny waslooking atherwith
achild's grateful trust“IhevTe thethings thatmake lifebeautiful,”
saidMrs Iaggarl'1want thisevening tobevery beautiful ioryou,

ToMrs laggart thegreatest surprise wasthemoment when she

She felttherising pain ofexhaustion—notknowing that itwas
pain, feeling itonly insudden stabs thatmade heraware ofsome
partofherbody foraninstant, tobeforgotten inthenext: herarm
socket—hershoulder blades— herhips, with thewhite shorts sticking
toherskin-“the muscles ofherlegs,when sheleaped tomeet the
ball, butdidnotremember whether shecamedown totouch the
ground again— hereyelids, when theskywent dark icdandtheball
came atherthrough thedarkness like awhirling white flame— the
thin, hotwire thatshotfrom herankle, upherback, andwenton
shooting straight across the air,driving the ball atFrancisco’s
figure. ...She feltanexultant pleasure—because every stabofpain
begun inherbodyhadtoend inhis,because hewasbeing exhausted
asshewas- what shedidtoherself, shewasdoing italso tohim—
thiswaswhat hefelt—thiswaswhat shedrove him to—itwasnot
herpain thatshe feltorherbody, but his.
Inthemoments when shesawhisface, shesawthathewaslaugh-
ing.Hewaslooking atherasifheunderstood. Hewasplaying, not
towin, buttomake ithaider toiher—sending hisshots wild to
make herrun-losing points toseehertwist herbody inanagonizing
backhand—standing still, letting herthink hewould miss, only tolet
hisarmshoot outcasually atthelastmoment andsend thebailback
withsuch force thatsheknew shewould miss it.She feltasifshe
could notmove again, notevei— and itwasstrange tofindherself
landing suddenly attheother sideofthecourt, smashing theball in
lime, smashing itasifshewished ittoburst topieces, asifshe
wished itwere Francisco’s face.
Justoncemore, shethought, even itthenextonewould crack the
bones ofherarm . .Justonce more, even ittheairwhich she
forced down ingasps pasthertight, swollen throat, would bestopped
altogether . ..Then she feltnothing, nopain,nomuscles, only the
thought thatshehadtobeat him. toseehimexhausted, toseehim
collapse, andthenshewould befree todieinthenextmoment.
Shewon.Perhaps itwas hislaughing thatmadehim lose, foronce.
Hewalked tothenet,while shestood still,andthrew hisracket
across, atherfeet, as itknowing that thiswaswhat shewanted. He
walked outotthecourt and felldown oilthegrass ofthelawn,
collapsing, hisheadonhisarm.
Sheapproached himslowly. Shestood over him,looking down at
hisbody stretched ather feet, looking athissweat-drenched shirt
andthestrands ofhishair spilled across hisarm.Heraised hishead.
Hisglance moved slowly upthelineofher legs, tohershorts, to
herblouse, tohereyes.Uwasamocking glance thatseemed tosee
straight through herclothes andthrough hermind.And itseemed
tosaythathehadwon.
Shesatatherdesk atRockdale that night, alone intheoldstation
building, looking atthesky inthewindow. Itwasthehour sheliked
best,when thetoppanes ofthewindow grew lighter, andthe rails
ofthetrack outside became threads ofblurred silver across thelower
panes. Sheturned offherlampandwatched thevast, soundless mo-
tionoflightover amotionless earth. Tilings stood still, notaleaf
103
trembled onthebranches, while theskyslowly lost itscolor and
hec&tne anexpanse thatlooked likeaspread ofglowing water.
Hertelephone was silent atthishour, almost asifmovement had
stopped everywhere along thesystem. Sheheard steps approaching
outside, suddenly, close tothedoor. Francisco came in.Hehadnever
come here before, butshewasnotastonished toseehim.
“What areyoudoing upatthishour?” sheasked.
“Ididn't feel likesleeping."
“How didyougethere? 1didn't hearyour car."
“Iwalked."
Moments passed before sherealized thatshehadnotasked him
whyhecame andthatshedidnotwant toask it.
Hewandered through theroom, looking atthedusters ofwaybills
thathungonthewalls, atthecalendar with apicture oftheTaggart
Comet caught inaproud surge ofmotion toward theonlooker. He
seemed casually athome, asifhefeltthat theplace belonged to
them, astheyalways feltwherever theywent together. Buthedid
notseem towant totalk.Heasked afewquestions about herjob,
thenhekept silent.
Asthelightgrew outside, movement grewdown onthelineand
thetelephone started ringing inthesilence Sheturned toherwork.
Hesatinacomer, onelegthrown over theamiofhischair, waiting.
Sheworked swiftly, teelmg inordinately clear-headed. Shefound
pleasure intherapid precision ofherhands. Sheconcentrated on
thesharp, bright sound ofthephone, onthefigures ottrainnumbers,
carnumbers, order numhers. Shewasconscious ofnothing else
Butwhen athinsheet ofpaper fluttered down tothefloorand
shebent topick itup.shewassuddenly asintently conscious ofthat
particular moment, ofherself andherownmovement. Shenoticed
hergray linen skirt, therolled sleeve ofhergray blouse andher
naked armreaching down forthepaper. She feltherheart stop
causelessly inthekind ofgaspone feels inmoments ofanticipation.
Shepicked upthepaper andturned back toherdesk.
Itwasalmost fulldaylight. Atrainwent past thestation, without
stopping. Inthepurity ofthemorning light, thelong lineofcarroofs
melted into asilver string, andthetrainseemed suspended above
theground, notquite touching it,going pastthrough the air.The
floor ofthestation trembled, and glass rattled inthewindows. She
watched thetrain’s flight with asmile ofexcitement. Sheglanced at
Francisco; hewaslooking ather,with thesame vsrmle.
When thedayoperator arrived, sheturned thestation over to
him,andtheywalked outintothemorning air.7besunhadnotyet
risenandtheairseemed radiant initsstead. ,She feltnoexhaustion.
She feltasifshewere justgetting up.
Shestarted toward hercar,butFrancisco said, “Let’s Jvalkhome.
We’llcome forthecarlater,"
“All right."
Shewasnotastonished andshedidnotmind theProspect of
walking fivemiles. Itseemed natural: natural tothemoment's pecu-
liarreality thatwassharply clear, butcutofffrom everything, imme-
104
diate, butdisconnected, likeabright island inawall offog,the
heightened, unquestioning reality one feelswhen one isdrunk.
Theroad ledthrough thewoods. They leftthehighway foranold
trail thatwent twisting among thetrees across miles ofuntouched
country. There werenotraces ofhuman existence around them. Old
ruts,overgrown with grass,madehuman presence seemmore distant,
adding thedistance ofyears tothedistance ofmiles.Ahaze of
twilight remained over theground, hut inthebreaks between the
treetrunks there were leaves thathung inpatches olshining green
andseemed tolight theforest. The leaves hung still.They walked,
alone tomove through amotionless world. Shenoticed suddenly
thattheyhadnotsaid aword toralong time.
Theycame toaclearing. Itwasasmall hollow atthebottom of
ashaftmade ofstraight rock hillsides. Astream cutacross thegrass,
andtreebranches flowed low totheground, likeacurtain ofgreen
fluid.Thesound ofthewater stressed thesilence. The distant cutof
open skymade theplaceseemmore hidden. Farabove, onthecrest
oiahill,onetreecaught the firstraysofsunlight
They stopped andlooked ateach other. Sheknew, onlywhen he
did it,thatshehadknown hewould. Heseized her.she feltherlips
onhismouth, feltherarms grasping him inviolent answer, andknew
forthe firsttimehowmuch shehadwanted himtodo it.
She feltamoment's rebellion and ahintoffear.Heheld her,
pressing thelength ofhisbody against herswith atense, purposeful
insistence, hishandmoving over herbreasts asifhewere learning
aproprietor’s intimacy with herbody, ashocking intimacy that
needed noconsent from her,nopermission. Shetried topullherself
away, butsheonlyleaned back against hisarms longenough tosee
hisfaceand hissmile, thesmile that toldhershehadgiven him
permission longagoShethought thatshemust escape: instead, it
wasshewhopulled hisheaddown tofind hismouth again.
Sheknew thatfearwas useless, thathewould dowhathewished,
thatthedecision was his,thatheleftnothing possible toherexcept
thething shewanted most™ -tosubmit. Shehadnoconscious realiza-
tionofhispurpose, hervague knowledge ofitwaswiped out,she
hadnopower tobelieve itclearly, inthismoment, tobelieve itabout
herself, sheknew only thatshewasafraid—yetwhat she feltwasas
ifshewere crying tohim:Don't askmeforit—oh,don't askme—
do it!
Shebraced her feet foraninstant, toresist, buthismouth was
pressed tohersandtheywentdown totheground together, never
breaking their lipsapart. She laystill— asthemotionless, then the
quivering object ofanactwhich hedidsimply, unhesitatingly, asof
right, theright oftheunendurable pleasure itgave them.
Henamed what itmeant toboth ofthem inthe firstwords he
spoke afterwards. Hesaid,“Wehadtolearn itfrom each other.”
Shelooked athislong figure stretched onthegrass beside her,he
wore black slacks andablack .shirt, hereyesstopped onthebelt
pulled tight across hisslender waistline, andshe felttheslabofan
emotion thatwas tikeagasp ofpride, pride inherownership ofhis
105
body, vShetavonherback, looking upatthesky,feeling nodesire to
move orthink orknow thattherewasanytimebeyond thismoment.
When shecame home, when shelayinbed,naked because her
body hadbecome anunfamiliar possession, tooprecious forthe
touch ofanightgown, because itgave herpleasure tofeelnaked
andtofeciasifthewhite sheets ofherbedweretouched byFrancis-
co’sbody—when shethought thatshewould notsleep, because she
didnotwant torestandlosethemost wonderful exhaustion shehad
everknown—herlastthought wasofthetimeswhen shehadwanted
toexpress, butfound noway todo it,aninstant's knowledge ofa
feeling greater than happiness, thefeeling ofone’s blessing upon the
whole oftheearth, thefeeling ofbeing inlove with the fact that
one exists and inthiskind ofworld; shethought thattheactshe
hadlearned wasthewayoneexpressed it.Ifthiswasathought of
thegravest importance, shedidnotknow it,nothing could begrave
inauniverse from which theconcept ofpainhadbeen wiped out,
shewasnotthere toweigh herconclusion; shewasasleep, afaint
smile onherface, inasilent, luminous room filled with the light
ofmorning.
Thatsummer, shemethim inthewoods, inhidden corners bythe
river, onthefloor ofanabandoned shack, inthecellar ofthehouse.
These were theonly times when shelearned tofeci asense of
beauty—bylooking upatoldwooden rafters oratthesteel plate of
anair-conditioning machine thatwhirred tensely, rhythmically above
their heads. Shewore slacks orcotton summer dresses, yetshewas
never sofeminine aswhen shestood beside him,sagging inhisarms,
abandoning herself toanything hewished, inopenacknowledgment
ofhispower toreduce hertohelplessness bythepleasure hehad
thepower togive her.Hetaught hereverymanner otsensuality he
could invent. “Isn’t itwonderful thatourbodies cangive ussomuch
pleasure?” hesaid toheronce, quite simply. They were happy and
radiantly innocent. They were both incapabie oftheconception that
joy issin.
They kept their secret from theknowledge ofothers, notasa
shameful guilt, butasathing thatwasimmaculately theirs, beyond
anyone's right ofdebate orappraisal. Sheknew thegeneral doctrine
onsex,heldbypeople inoneform oranother, thedoctrine thatsex
wasanuglyweakness ofman's lower nature, tobecondoned regret-
fully. Sheexperienced anemotion ofchastity thatmade hershrink
notfrom thedesires ofherbody, butfrom anycontact with the
mindswho held thisdoctrine.
That winter, Francisco came toseeher inNewYork, atunpredict-
able intervals. Hewould flydown from Cleveland, withoqt warning,
twice aweek, orhewould vanish formonths. Shewould sitonthe
floor ofherroom, surrounded bycharts andblueprints, !shcwould

voice ask,“Are you?” andleap toherfeettothrow thefloor open,

tress,am fnot?”Helaughed. ‘That’s what youare.” feltthe
106
pride awoman issupposed toexperience atbeing granted the title
ofwife.
Inthemany months ofhisabsence, shenever wondered whether

shewastooyoung toknow thereason, that indiscriminate desire
andunseleetive indulgence were possible only tothosewhoregarded
sexandthemselves asevil.
Sheknew littleabout Francisco’s life. Itwashislastyear incollege;
heseldom spoke ofit,andshenever questioned him.Shesuspected
thathewasworking toohard, because shesaw, atlimes, theunnatu-
rally bright look ofhisface, thelook ofexhilaration thatcomes
from driving one’s energy beyond itslimit. Shelaughed athimonce,
boasting thatshewasanoldemployee ofTaggart Transcontinental,
while hehadnotstarted towork foraliving. Hesaid;“My father
refuses toletmework ford’Anconia Copper until1graduate.1'
“When didyoulearn tobeobedient?’* “Imust respect hiswishes.
He istheowner ofd’Anconia Copper ...He isnot,however, the
owner olallthecopper companies intheworld." There wasahint
ofsecret amusement inhissmile.
Shedidnotlearn thestory until thenext fall,when hehadgradua-
tedandreturned toNewYork alter avisit tohisfather inBuenos
Aires, Then hetoldherthathehadtaken twocourses ofeducation
during the lastlour years: one atthePatrick Henry University, the
other inacopper toundry ontheoutskirts ofClc\e!amJ, “1liketo
learn things iormyself," hesaid.Hehad started working atthe
foundry asfurnace boy,when hewassixteen—andnow. attwenty,
heowned it.Heacquired the first titleofproperly, with theaidot
some inaccuracy about hisage.onthedaywhen hereceived his
university diploma, andhesentthem both tohisfather.
Heshowed heraphotogtaph olthefoundry. Itwasasmall, grimy
place, disreputable with age,battered bvyears ofalosing struggle:
above itsentrance gate, likeanew flagonthemast ofaderelict,
hung thesign:d'Ancoma Copper.
The public relations man olhisfather’s office inNewYork had
moaned, outraged. “But.Don Francisco, you can'tdothat!What
willthepublic think? Thatname --on adump ofthiskind?" “It’s
myname," Francisco hadanswered.
When heentered hisfather’s office inBuenos Aires, alarge room,
severe andmodern asalaboratory, withphotographs oftheproper-
tiesofd’Anconia Copper a*soleornament onitswalls—photographs
ofthegreatest mines, oredocks andfoundries intheworld- -hesaw,
intheplace ofhonor, facing hisfather's desk, aphotograph ofthe
Cleveland foundry with thenew signabove itsgate.
Hisfather’s eyesmoved from thephotograph toFrancisco’s face
ashestood infront ofthedesk.
“Isn't italittletoosoon?" hisfather asked.
“1couldn't have stood lour years ofnothing butlectures."
“Where didyou gelthemoney foryour firstpayment onthat
property?”
'“By playing theNewYork stock market."
"What? Who taught youtodothat?”
107
“It isnot difficult tojudge which industrial ventures willsucceed
andwhich won't."
“Where didyougetthemoney toplaywith?"
“From theallowance yousentme,andfrommywages."
“When didyouhave time towatch thestock market?"
“While 1waswriting athesis ontheinfluence—upon subsequent
metaphysical systems—ofAristotle's theory oftheImmovable
Mover."
Francisco's stay inNewYork was brief, that fall.Hisfather was
sending himtoMontana asassistant superintendent ofad’Anconia
mine.“Oh well," hesaid toDagny, smiling, “my father does not
think itadvisable toletmerisetoo fast. Iwould notaskhimtotake
meonfaith. Ifhewants afactual demonstration, Ishall comply."
Inthespring, Francisco came back—ashead oftheNewYork office
ofd'Anconia Copper.
Shedidnotseehimoften inthenexttwoyears. Shenever knew
where hewas, inwhat cityoronwhat continent, thedayafter she
hadseen him. fiealways came toherunexpectedly —andsheliked
it,because itmade him acontinuous presence inher life, likethe
rayofahidden light thatcould hitheiatanymoment
Whenever shesawhim inhisoffice, shethought ofhishands as
shehadseenthemonthewheel ofamotorboat: hedrove hisbusi-
ness with thesame smooth, dangerous, confidently mastered speed.
Butonesmall incident remained inhermind asashock itdidnot

helpless anger. Hesaid, “There's something wrong intheworld
There’s always been. Something noonehasevernamed orex-
plained"Hewould not tellherwhat i(was.
When shesawhim again, notrace ofthat incident remained in
hismanner. Itwasspring andtheystood together ontheroof terrace
ofarestaurant, the light silkofherevening gown blowing inthe
wind against his tallfigure informal black clothes. They looked at
the city. Inthedining room behind them, thesounds ofthemusic
were aconcert £tude byRichard Halley, Halley’s name wasnot
known tomany, buttheyhaddiscovered itandtheyloved hismusic.
Francisco said,“We don’t have tolook forskyscrapers inthedis-
tance, dowe?We’ve reached them." Shesmiled and said, “Ithink
we’re going pastthem. .. .I’malmost afraid ...we’reonaspeeding

Hewastwenty-three when hisfather diedandhewent toBuenos

himagain forthree years.
Hewrote toher, atfirst, atrandom intervals. Hetrrule about
d’Anconia Copper, about theworld market, about issi|es affecting
theinterests ofTaggart Transcontinental. Hisletters wer^ brief, writ-
tenbyhand, usually atnight.
Shewasnotunhappy inhisabsence. She, too,wastaking her first

steps toward thecontrol ofafuture kingdom. Among theleaders of
industry, herfather’s friends, sheheard itsaid thatonehadbetter
watch theyoung d’Ancoma heir; ifthatcopper company hadbeen
great before, itwould sweep theworld now,under what hismanage-
ment promised tobecome. Shesmiled, without astonishment. There
weremoments when she feltasudden, violent longing forhim,but
itwasonly impatience, notpain. Shedismissed it,intheconfident
knowledge thattheywere bothworking toward afuture thatwould
bring them everything theywanted, including each other. Then his
letters stopped.
Shewastwenty-four onthatday ofspring when thetelephone
rangonherdesk, inanoffice oftheTaggart Building. “Dagny,”
said avoice sherecognized atonce, “I’m attheWayne-Falkland.
Come tohave dinner withmetonight. Atseven.” Hesaid itwithout
greeting, asiftheyhadparted thedaybefore. Because ittook her
amoment toregain theartofbreathing, sherealized forthe first
tunehowmuch thatvoice meant toher.“AH light .. .Francisco,”
sheanswered. They needed tosaynothing else.Shethought, replac-
ingthereceiver, that hisreturn wasnatural andasshehadalways
expected ittohappen, except thatshehadnotexpected hersudden
need topronounce hisname orthestabofhappiness she feltwhile
pronouncing it.
When sheentered hishotel room, thatevening, shestopped short.
Hestood inthemiddle oftheroom, looking ather—andshesawa
smile thatcame slowly, involuntarily, asifhehad losttheability to
smile andwasastonished thatheshould regain it.Helooked athei
incredulously, notquite believing what shewasorwhat hefelt.His
glance was likeaplea, likethecrylorhelp ofamanwhocould

started tosay,“Hi—” buthedidnotfinish it.Instead, after amo-
ment. hesaid, ‘You’re beautiful, Dagny.” Hesaid itasifithurthim.
“Francisco, I—”
Heshook hishead, nottoletherpronounce thewords theyhad
never saidtoeach other—eventhough theyknew thatbothhadsaid
andheard them inthatmoment.
Heapproached, hetook herinhisarms, hekissed hermouth and
held her foialong time.When shelooked upathisface, hewas
smiling down atherconfidently, derisively. Itwasasmile that told
herhewas incontrol ofhimself, ofher,ofeverything, andordered
hertoforget what shehadseen inthat firstmoment. “Hi, Slug”
hesaid.
Feeling certain ofnothing except thatshemust notaskquestions,
shesmiled and said, “Hi, Frisco.”
Shecould haveunderstood anychange, butnotthethings shesaw.
There wasnosparkle oflifeinhisface,nohintofamusement; the
facehadbecome implacable. Thepleaofhisfirstsmile hadnotbeen
apica ofweakness; hehadacquired anairofdetermination that
seemed merciless. Heacted likeamanwhostood straight, under
theweight ofanunendurable burden. Shesawwhat sheamid not
have believed possible*, thatthere were tines ofbitterness inhisface
andthathelooked tortured.
109
“Dagny, don’t beastonished byanything 1do,”hesaid, “orby
anything Imayeverdointhefuture.”
Thatwastheonlyexplanation hegranted her,thenproceeded to
acta$ifthere were nothing toexplain.
Shecould feelnomore than afaint anxiety; itwasimpossible to
feelfearforhisfateorinhispresence. When helaughed, shethought
theywere back inthewoods bytheHudson: hehadnotchanged
andnever would.
Thedinner wasserved inhisroom. Shefound itamusing toface
himacross atable laidoutwith theicyformality pertaining toexces-
sive cost, inahotelroom designed asaEuropean palace.
TheWayne-Falkland wasthemost distinguished hotel leftonany
continent. Itsstyle ofindolent luxury, ofvelvet drapes, sculptured
panels andcandlelight, seemed adeliberate contrast toitsfunction:
noonecould afford itshospitality except menwhocame toNew
York onbusiness, tosettle transactions involving theworld. She
noticed thatthemanner otthewaiters whoserved theii dinner sug-
gested aspecial deference tothisparticular guest ofthehotel, and
thatFrancisco didnotnotice it.Hewasindifferently athome. He
hadlong sincebecome accustomed tothe fact thathewasSeftor
d’Anconia ofd’Anconia Copper.
Butshethought itstrange thathedidnotspeak about hiswork.
Shehadexpected ittobehisonly interest, the firstthing hewould
share with herHedidnotmention it.Heledhertotalk, instead,
about herjob.herprogress, andwhat she feltforTaggart Transconti-
nental. Shespoke of itasshehadalways spoken tohim. inthe
knowledge thathewastheonlyonewhocould understand herpas-
sionate devotion. Hemade nocomment, buthelistened intently.
Awaiter hadturned ontheradio fordinner music: theyhadpaid
noattention to itButsuddenly, acrash ofsound jarred theroom,
almost asifasubterranean blasthadstruck thewallsandmade them
tremble. Theshock came, notfrom theloudness, butfrom thequality
ofthesounds. ItwasHalley's newConcerto, recently written, the
Fourth.
They satinsilence, listening tothestatement oficbellion— the
anthem ofthetriumph ofthegreat victims whowould refuse to
accept pain. Francisco listened, looking outatthe city.
Without transition orwarning, heasked, hi:>voice oddly un-
stressed, “Dagny, whatwould yousay if 1asked youtoleave Taggait
Transcontinental and let itgotohell, asitwillwhen your brother
takes over?”
“What would Isay ifyouaskedmetoconsider theidea ofcommit-
tingsuicide?” sheanswered angrily.
Heremained silent.
“Why didyousaythat?” shesnapped.*1didn’t think: you’d joke
about it.It’snotlikeyou.”
There wasnotouch ofhumor inhisface.Heanswered quietly,
gravely, “No.Ofcourse. 1shouldn’t.”
Shebrought herself toquestion himabout hiswork. lifeanswered
thequestions; hevolunteered nothing. Sherepeated toh|mthecom-
ments oftheindustrialists about thebrilliant prospects ofd’Anconia
110
Copper under hismanagement. ‘That’s true,” hesaid, hisvoice
lifeless.
Insudden anxiety, notknowing whatprompted her,sheasked,
“Francisco, whydidyoucome toNewYork?”
Heanswered slowly, “Toseeafriend who called forme.”
“Business?”
Looking past her, asifanswering athought ofhisown, afaint
smile ofbitter amusement onhisface, buthisvoice strangely soft
andsad,heanswered:
“Yes.”
Itwaslong pastmidnight when sheawakened inbedbyhisside.
Nosounds camefrom thecitybelow. The stillness oftheroommade
lifeseem suspended forawhile. Relaxed inhappiness and incom-
plete exhaustion, sheturned lazily toglance athim.Helayonhis
back, half-propped byapillow. Shesaw hisprofile against thefoggy
glow ofthenight sky inthewindow. Hewasawake, hiseyeswere
open.Heheld hismouth closed like aman lying inresignation in
unbearable pain; bearing it,making noattempt tohide it
Shewastoofrightened tomove.Hefeltherglance andturned to
her.Heshuddered suddenly, hethrew offtheblanket, helooked at
hernaked body, thenhefellforward andburied hisfacebetween her
breasts. Heheld hershoulders, hanging onto herconvulsively. She
heard thewords, muffled, hismouth pressed toherskin:
“1can’t give itup! Ican’t!”
“What?” shewhispered.
“You.”
“Why should—*'
“And everything.”
“Why should yougive itup?”
“Dagny! Helpmetoremain. Torefuse. Even though he’s right!”
Sheasked evenly. “To refuse what, Francisco?”
Hedidnotanswer, only pressed hisfaceharder against her.
She layvery still, conscious ofnothing butasupreme need of
caution. Hishead onherbreast, herhand caressing hishair gently,
steadily, shelaylooking upattheceiling oftheroom, atthesculp-
tured garlands faintly visible inthedarkness, andshewaited, numb
with terror.
Hemoaned, “It's right, but it’ssohard todo!OhGod. it’sso
hard!”
After awhile, heraised hishead.Hesalup.Hehadstopped
trembling.
“What isit,Francisco?"
“Ican’t tellyou.” Hisvoice wassimple, open, without attempt to
disguise suffering, but itwasavoice thatobeyed himnow.“You’re
notready tohear it.”
“Iwant tohelpyou.”
“You can’t.”
“You said, tohelpyourefuse.”
“1can't refuse.”
“Then letmeshare itwithyou.”
Heshook hishead.
111
Hesatlooking down ather, asifweighing aquestion. Then he
shook hishead again, inanswer tohimself.
“IfI’mnotsure Icanstand it,”hesaid,andthestrange newnote
inhisvoice wastenderness, “how could you?”
Shesaidslowly, with effort, trying tokeep herself from screaming,
“Francisco, 1have toknow.”
“Will youforgive me? fknow you’re frightened, and it’scruel.
But willyoudothisforme—willyou let itgo,just let itgo,and
don’t askmeanything?”
“1—”
“That’s allyoucandoforme.Willyou?”
“Yes, Francisco.”
“Don’t beafraid forme. Itwasjust thisonce. Itwon’t happen to
meagain. Itwillbecome much easier . ..later.”
“If 1could—”
“No.Gotosleep, dearest.”
Itwasthe firsttimehehadeverused thatword.
Inthemorning, hefaced heropenly, notavoiding heranxious
glance, butsaying nothing about it.Shesawboth serenity andsuffer-
inginthecalm ofhisface,anexpression likeasmile ofpain,though
hewasnotsmiling. Strangely, itmade himlookyounger. Hedidnot
look likeaman bearing torture now, butlikeamanwho sees that
which makes thetorture worth bearing.
Shedidnotquestion him.Before leaving, sheasked only,“When
will 1seeyouagain?”
Heanswered. “Idon’t know. Don’t wait forme.Dagny. Next time
wemeet, you willnotwant toseeme. Iwillhave areason forthe
things HIdo.But Ican’t tellyouthereason andyou willberight
todamn me. Iamnotcommitting thecontemptible actofasking
youtotakemeonfaith.Youhave tolivebyyourownknowledge
andjudgment. You willdamn me.You willbehurt.Trynottolet
ithurtyoutoomuch. Remember that Itoldyou thisandthat itwas
all lcould tellyou.”
Sheheard nothing fromhimorabout him forayear.When she
began tohear gossip and toreadnewspaper stories, shedidnot
believe, atfirst, thatthey referred toFrancisco d’Anconia. After a
while, shehadtobelieve it.
Sheread thestory oftheparty hegaveonhisyacht, intheharbor
ofValparaiso; theguests wore bathing suits, andanartificial ramof
champagne andflower petals kept falling upon thedecks throughout
thenight.
Sheread thestory oftheparty hegave atanAlgerian desert

SheTead theaccounts ofthebusiness ventures heundertook at

Shesawhimonce, atareception given byanambassador inNew

with aglancemwhich nopast existed. Shedrewhimaside. Shesaid
only, “Francisco, why?”“Why— what?” heasked. Sheturned away.
“1warned you,” hesaid.Shedidnottrytoseehim again.
Shesurvived it.Shewasable tosurvive it,because shedidnot
believe insuffering. Shefaced with astonished indignation theugly
factoffeeling pain, andrefused tolet itmatter. Suffering was a
senseless accident, itwasnotpart oflifeasshesaw it.Shewould
notallow pain tobecome important. Shehadnoname forthekind
ofresistance sheoffered, fortheemotion from which theresistance
came; butthewords thatstood asitsequivalent inhermind were:
Itdoes notcount—itisnottobetaken seriously. Sheknew these
were thewords, even inthemoments when there wasnothing left
within herbutscreaming andshewished shecould losethefaculty
ofconsciousness sothat itwould not tellherthatwhat could notbe
truewas true.Not tobetaken seriously—animmovable certainty

seriously.
Shefought it.Sherecovered. Years helped hertoreach theday
when shecould facehermemories indifferently, then thedaywhen
she feltnonecessity tofacethem. Itwasfinished andofnoconcern
toheranylonger.
There hadbeen noothermen inher life.Shedidnotknow
whether thishadmade herunhappy. Shehadhadnotime toknow.
Shefound theclean, brilliant sense oflifeasshewanted it—inher
work. Once, Francisco hadgiven herthesame sense, afeeling that
belonged with herwork and inherworld. Themenshehadmet
sincewere likethemen shemet ather first ball.
Shehadwon thebattle against hermemories Butoneform oftor-
tureremained, untouched bytheyears, thetorture oftheword“why?”
Whatever thetragedy hemet.whyhadFrancisco taken theugliest
wayofescape, asignoble asthewayofsome cheap alcoholic? 'The
boyshehadknown could nothavebecome auseless coward. An
incomparable mind could notturn itsingenuity totheinvention of
melting ballrooms. Yethehadanddid.andtherewasnoexplanation
tomake itconceivable andtoletherforget him inpeace. Shecould
notdoubt thefactofwhat hehadbeen; shecould notdoubt the
factofwhat hehadbecome; yetonemade theother impossible. At
times, shealmost doubted herown rationality ortheexistence of
any rationality anywhere; but thiswasadoubt which shedidnot
permit toanyone. Yetthere wasnoexplanation, noreason, noclue
toanyconceivable reason— and inallthedays oftenyears shehad
found nohintofananswer.
No,shethought— asshewalked through thegray twilight past
thewindows ofabandoned shops, totheWayne- Falkland Hotel—
113
fto,there could benoanswer. Shewould notseek it.Itdidnot
matter now.
Theremnant ofviolence, theemotion rising asathintrembling
within her,wasnotforthemanshewasgoing tosee; itwasacry
ofprotest against asacrilege—against thedestruction otwhathad
been greatness.
Inabreak between buildings, shesawthetowers oftheWaync-
Fatkland. She feltaslight jolt, inherlungs and legs, thatstopped
herforaninstant. Then shewalked onevenly.
Bythetime shewalked through themarble lobby, totheelcvatoi,
thendown thewide, velvet-carpeted, soundless corridors ofthe
Wayne -Falkland, she fellnothing butacoldanger thatgrew colder
withevery step.
Shewascertain oftheanger when sheknocked athisdoor. She
heard hisvoice, answering, “runic in.”Shejerked thedooropen
andentered.
Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian d’Anconia satonthe
floor, playing marbles.
Nobody everwondered whether Francisco d’Anconia wasgood-
looking ornot; itseemed irrelevant, when heentered aroom, itwas
impassible tolook atanyone else. His tall,slender figure hadanair
ofdistinction, tooauthentic tobemodern, andhemoved asifhe
had acape floating behind him inthewind. People explained him
bysaying thathehadthevitality ofahealthy animal, buttheyknew
dimly that thatwasnotcorrect. Hehad the vitality ofahealthy
human being, athing sorare thatnoonecould identity itHehad
thepower ofcertainty.
Nobody described hisappearance asLatin, yettheword applied
tohim, notinitspresent, butinitsoriginal sense, notpertaining to
Spain, buttoancient Rome. Hisbodyseemed designed asanexercise
inconsistency ofstyle, astylemade otgauntness, oflight flesh, of
long legsand swiftmovements. Hisfeatures hadthelineprecision
ofsculpture, flishairwasblack andstraight, swept back.Thesuntan
ofhisskin intensified thestartling color ofhiseyes: theywere a
pure, clear blue. Hisfacewasopen, itsrapid changes ofexpression
reflecting whatever hefelt, as ifhehadnothing tohide.Theblue
eyeswere stillandchangeless, never giving ahintofwhathethought.
Hesatonthefloor ofhisdrawing room, dressed insleeping paja-
masofthinblack silk.Themarbles spread onthecarpet around him
weremade ofthesemi-precious stones ofhisnative country: carne-
lianandrock crystal. HedidnotrisewhenDagny entered. Hesal
looking upather,and acrystal marble felllikeateardrop outof
hishand. Hesmiled, theunchanged, insolent, brilliant smile ofhis
childhood.
“Hi, Slug!”
Sheheard herself answering, irresistibly, helplessly, happily:
“Hi, Frisco!”
Shewaslooking athisface; itwasthefaceshehadknowfi. Itbore
nomark ofthekind oflifehehad led,norofwhat shehalseenon
their lastnight together. There wasnosignoftragedy, nobitterness,
notension—only theradiant mockery, matured and stressed, the
114
look ofdangerously unpredictable amusement, andthegreat, guilt*
lessserenity ofspirit* But this,shethought, wasimpossible; thiswas
more shocking than alltherest*
Hiseyeswere studying her:thebattered coatthrown open, half-
slipping offhershoulders, andtheslender body inagray suitthat
looked likeanoffice uniform.
“Ifyoucame here dressed like this inorder nottoletmenotice
how lovely youare,” hesaid,“you miscalculated. You're lovely: i
wish Icould tellyouwhat arelief itistoseeaface that's intelligent
though awoman’s. Butyoudon’t want tohear it.That’s notwhat
youcame here for.”
Thewords weieimproper insomany ways, yetwere saidsotightly
thattheybrought herback toreality, toanger andtothepurpose
ofher visit.Sheremained standing, looking down athim, herface
blank, refusing himanyrecognition ofthepersonal, even ofitspower
tooffend her.She said, “Icame here toaskyouaquestion.”
"Goahead.”
“When you toldthose reporters thatyoucame toNewYork to
witness thetarce, which farce didyoumean?”
Helaughed aloud, likeamanwhoseldom finds achance toenjoy
theunexpected.
“That’s what Ilikeabout you.Dagny. There areseven million
people inthecityofNew York, atpresent Outofseven million
people, youaretheonlyonetowhom itcould have occurred that I
wasn’t talking about theVaildivorce scandal.”
“What wereyoutalking about?”
“What alternative occurred toyou?”
“The SanSebastian disaster.”
“That's much more amusing than theVail divorce scandal, isn’t
it.”
Shesaid inthesolemn, merciless tone ofaprosecutor. “You did
itconsciously, coldbloodedly andwith fullintention.”
“Don’t youthink itwould bebetter ifyoutookyour coat offand
satdown?”
Sheknew shehadmade amistake bybetraying loomuch intensity.
Sheturned coldly, removed hercoatandthrew itaside.Hedidnot
risetohelp her.She satdown inanarmchair. Heremained onthe
floor, atsome distance, but itseemed asithewere sitting atherfeet.
“What was it1didwith fullintention?” heasked.
“'1lieentire SanSebastian swindle.”
“What wasmyfullintention?”
“Thai iswhat Iwant toknow,”
Hechuckled, as ifshehadasked himtoexplain inconversation
acomplex science requiring alifetime ofstudy.
“You knew that theSanSebastian mines were worthless,” she
said.“Youknew itbefore youbegan thewhole wretched business.”
“Then whydid Ibegin it?”
“Don’t start telling methatyougained nothing. Iknow it.Iknow
you lost fifteen million dollars ofyourownmoney. Yet itwasdone
onpurpose.”
“Can youthink ofamotive thatwould prompt metodoit?”
115
“No. It’sinconceivable.”
“Is it?Youassume that Ihave agreat mind, agreat knowledge
andagreat productive ability, sothatanything 1undertake must
necessarily besuccessful. And thenyouclaim that Ihadnodesire
toputoutmybest effort forthePeople’s State ofMexico. Inconceiv-
able, isn’t it?”
“You knew, before youbought thatproperty, thatMexico was in
thehands ofalooters' government. You didn't have tostart amining
project forthem.”
“No, Ididn't have to.'’
“You didn’t give adamn about thatMexican government, one
wayoranother, because—”
“You’re wrong about that.”
*—because youknew they’d seize those mines sooner orlater.
What youwere after isyourAmerican stock holders.”
“That’s true”Hewaslooking straight ather,hewasnotsmiling,
hisfacewasearnest. Headded, “That's partofthetruth.”
“What’s therest?”
“Uwasnot all Iwas after.”
“What else?”
“That’s foryoutoligure out.”
“Icame herebecause 1wanted youtoknow that Iambeginning
tounderstand yourpurpose”
Hesmiled. “Ifyou did.youwouldn’t havecome here”
“That’s true. Idon’t understand andprobably never shall. Iam
merely beginning toseepartofit.”
“Which part?”
“You hadexhausted every other form ofdepravity andsought a
new thrill byswindling people likeJimand hisfriends, inorder to
watch them squirm. Idon'tknow what sortofcorruption couldmake
anyone enjoy that, butthat’s what youcame toNewYork tosee,
attheright time.”
“They certainly provided aspectacle ofsquirming onthegiand
scale. Your brother James Inparticular.”
“They’re rotten fools, but inthiscase their onlycrime was that
they trusted you.They trusted yourname andyour honor.”
Again, shesawthelook ofearnestness andagainknew with cer-
tainty that itwasgenuine, when hesaid,“Yes.They did. 1know it.”
“And doyou find itamusing?”
“No. fdon’t find itamusing atall.”
Hehadcontinued playing with hismarbles, absently, indifferently,
taking ashotonce inawhile. Shenoticed suddenly the faultless
accuracy ofhisaim,the skillofhishands.Hemerely flicked hiswrist
andsent adrop ofstone shooting across thecarpet toclick sharply
against another drop. Shethought ofhischildhood andoftpepredic-
tions thatanything hedidwould bedone superlatively.
“No,” hesaid, “1don’t find itamusing. Your brother lames and
hisfriends knew nothing about thecopper-mining industry. They
knew nothing about making money. They didnotthink necessary
tolearn. They considered knowledge superfluous andjudgment ines-
sential. They observed thatthere 1was intheworld andt6at Imade
116
itrayhonor toknow. They thought theycould trust rayhonor. One
does notbetray atrust ofthiskind, doesone?”
“Then youdidbetray itintentionally?”
“That’s foryoutodecide, itwasyouwhospoke about their trust
andmyhonor. 1don’t think insuch terms anylonger. . .He
shrugged, adding, “Idon’t give adamn about your brother James
and hisfriends. Their theory wasnotnew, ithasworked forcentu-
ries.But itwasn’t foolproof. There isjustonepoint thatthey over-
looked. They thought itwass^fe torideonmybrain, because they
assumed thatthegoal ofmyjourney waswealth, AHtheir calcula-
tions rested onthepremise that Iwanted tomake money. What if
ididn’t?”
“Ifyoudidn't, what didyouwant?”
“They never askedmethat.Not toinquire aboutmyaims, motives
ordesires isanessential partoftheir theory.”
“Ifyoudidn’t want tomake money, what possible motive could
youhavehad?”

Sheclosed hereyes. Sheheard himlaughing; itwasthegayest

“My motive, Dagny? Youdon’t think that it’sthesimplest oneof

No,shethought, no,that’s nottrue; not ifhelaughed like that,
not ifhelooked ashedid.Thecapacity forunclouded enjoyment,
shethought, does notbelong toirresponsible fools; aninviolate
peace ofspirit isnottheachievement ofadrifter; tobeable tolaugh
like that istheend result ofthemost profound, most solemn
thinking.
Almost dispassionately, looking athisfigure stretched onthecar-
petather feet,sheobserved whatmemory itbrought back toher:
theblack pajamas stressed thelong lines ofhisbody, theopen collar
117
showed asmooth, young, sunburned skin— andshethought ofthe
figure inblack slacks and shirt stretched beside heronthegrass at
sunrise. Shehad feltpride then, thepride ofknowing thatsheowned
hisbody; she still felt it.Sheremembered suddenly, specifically, the
excessive actsoftheir intimacy; thememory should havebeen offen-
sivetohernow, butwasn’t. Itwas stillpride, without regret orhope,
anemotion thathadnopower toreach herand thatshehadno
power todestroy.
Unaccountably, byanassociation offeeling thatastonished her,
sheremembered whathadconveyed toherrecently thesame sense
ofconsummate joyashis.
“Francisco," sheheardhosellsaying softly, “weboth loved the
music ofRichard Halley ..."
“Istilllove it."
"Have vouevermethim?"
"Yes Why?'’
"Do youhappen toknow whether hehas written aFifth

"Well, hashe?"
"Youknow thatthere areonlv fouiHalley Concertos."
"Yes. But lwondered whether hehadwritten another one."
"He hasstopped writing."
"Iknow."
“Then whatmade youaskthat?"
"Just anidlethought. What ishedoingnow?Where ishe?"
"Idon't know. 1haven’t seenhim foralong time.What made

"Ididn't saythere was 1merely wondered about it."
"Why didyouthink ofRichard Halley justnow‘>"
"Because"—she felthercontrol ciacking alittle- "because my

Mrs. Gilbert Vail."
Helaughed, relieved "Oh, that? . ..Incidentally, ilyou’ve been

inthestory ofMrs. Gilbert Vail?"
"1don't read thestuff,"
"You should. Shegave such abeautiful description oflastNew

The editorial said that atatimeofdwindling production, shrinking
markets andvanishing opportunities tomake aliving, itwasunfair
toletonemanhoard several business enterprises, while others had
none; itwasdestructive toletafewcorner alltheresources, leaving
others nochance; competition was essential tosociety, and itwas
society’s duty toseethatnocompetitor ever rosebeyond therange
ofanybody whowanted tocompete withhim.The editorial predicted
thepassage ofabillwhich hadbeen proposed, abillforbidding any
person orcorporation toownmore thanonebusiness concern.
Wesley Mouch, hisWashington man, had toldRearden notto

defeated. Rearden understood nothing about thatkind offight.He
left ittoMouch and his staff.Hecould barely findtime toskim

Mouch requested forthebattle.
Rearden didnotbelieve thatthe billwould pass.Hewasincapable

had toconcern oneself with therational, nottheinsane—thatone
hadtoseek thatwhich was right, because therightanswer always

Hegave himself notime toseekananswer. Hefinished dressing,
quickly, pitilessly.
Holding himself erect, his tallfigure moving with theunstressed,
unhurried confidence ofhabitual authority, thewhite ofafinehand-

slowly down thestairs tothedrawing room, looking— tothesatisfac-

“Man? What isman? He’s justacollection ofchemicals withdelu-
sions ofgrandeur,” said Dr.Pritchett toagroup ofguests across
theroom.
Dr.Pritchett picked acanape offacrystal dish, held itspeared
between twostraight fingers anddeposited itwhole into hismouth.
“Man’s metaphysical pretensions,” hesaid, “are preposterous. A
miserable bitofprotoplasm, fullofugly little concepts andmean
littleemotions—and itimagines itself important! Really, youknow,
that istheroot ofallthetroubles intheworld.”
“But which concepts arenotuglyormean, Professor?” asked an
earnest matron whose husband owned anautomobile factory.
“None,” said Dr. Pritchett. “None within therange ofman’s
capacity.”
Ayoung manasked hesitantly, “But itwehaven’t anygood con-
cepts, howdoweknow thattheoneswe’ve gotareugly? 1mean,
bywhat standard?”
“There aren’t anystandards.”
This silenced hisaudience.
“The philosophers ofthepastwere superficial,” Dr.Pritchett went
on.“Itremained forourcentury toredefine thepurpose ofphiloso-
phy.Thepurpose ofphilosophy isnottohelpmen findthemeaning
oflife,buttoprove tothem thatthere isn’t arty.”
Anattractive young woman, whose father owned acoalmine,
asked indignantly, “Who can tellusthat?”
“1amtrying to.” said Dr.Pritchett. Forthe lastthree years, he
hadbeen head oftheDepartment ofPhilosophy atthePatrick
Henry University.
Lillian Reardon approached, herjewels glittering under thelights.
Theexpression onherfacewasheld tothesoft hint ol‘asmile, set

tance whatever inthevastscheme oftheuniverse, thatnopossible
significance canbeattached tohisactivities, that itdoes notmatter
whether helives ordies,hewillbecome much more ...tractable.”
Heshrugged andreached foranother canape.Abusinessman said
uneasily, “What Iasked youabout. Professor, waswhatyouthought
about theEqualization ofOpportunity Bill.”
“Oh, that?” saidDr.Pritchett, “But Ibelieve 1made itdear that
Iaminfavor of it,because Iaminfavor ofafreeeconomy. Afree
economy cannot exist without competition. Therefore, menmustbe
forced tocompete. Therefore, wemust control men inorder toforce
them tobefree.”
“But, look .. .isn’t that sortofacontradiction?”
“Not inthehigher philosophical sense. Youmust learn tosee
beyond thestatic definitions ofold-fashioned thinking. Nothing is
static intheuniverse. Everything isfluid.”
“But itstands toreason thatif—”
127
“Reason, mydear fellow, isthemost nalfve ofallsuperstitions.
That, atleast, hasbeen generally conceded inourage."
“But Idon’t quite understand howwecan—”
“You suffer from thepopular delusion ofbelieving thatthings can
beunderstood. Youdonotgrasp the fact that theuniverse isa
solid contradiction.'’
“Acontradiction ofwhat?" asked thematron.
“Of itself?'
“How ...how’s that?”
“My dearmadam, theduty ofthinkers isnottoexplain, butto
demonstrate thatnothing canbeexplained.”
“Yes, ofcourse .. .only ..
“The purpose ofphilosophy isnottoseekknowledge, buttoprove
thatknowledge isimpossible toman.”
“Butwhenweprove it,”asked theyoung woman, “what’s going
tobeleft?”
“Instinct” saidDr,Pritchett reverently
Attheother endoftheroom, agroup was listening toBalph
Eubank. Hesatupright ontheedge ofanarmchair, inorder to
counteract theappearance ofhisface arid figure, which hadaten-
dency tospread ifrelaxed.
“The literature ofthepast.” saidBalph Eubank, “was ashallow
fraud. Itwhitewashed life inorder toplease themoney tycoons
whom itserved. Morality, free will,achievement, happy endings, and
man assome sortofheroic being—allthat stuff islaughable tous.
Ouragehasgiven depth toliterature forthe firsttime, byexposing
therealessence oflife.”
Averyyoung girl inawhite evening gown asked timidly, “What
istherealessence oflife,Mr.Eubank?”
“Suffering,” saidBalph Eubank. “Defeat andsulfering.”
“But ...butwhy? People arehappy . . .sometimes . ..aren’t
they?”
“That isadelusion ofthose whose emotions aresuperficial.”
The girlblushed. Awealthy woman whohadinherited anoilre-
finery, asked guiltily, “What should wedotoraise thepeople's liter-
arytaste, Mr.Eubank9”
“That isagreat social problem,” saidBalph Eubank. Hewas
described astheliterary leader oftheage,buthadnever written a
book thatsoldmore than three thousand copies. “Personally, 1be-
lieve thatanEqualization ofOpportunity Billapplying toliterature
would bethesolution.”
“Oh,doyouapprove ofthat Billforindustry? I’mnotsure 1
know what tothink ofit.”
“Certainly, Iapprove of it.Our culture hassunk intriabogof
materialism. Men have lost allspiritual values intheiif pursuit of
material production andtechnological trickery. They're tfaocomfort-
able.They willreturn toanobler life ifweteach th|m tobear
privations. Soweought toplace alimitupon theirmatepal greed.”
“Ihadn't thought ofitthatway,” saidthewoman apologetically.
“Buthow areyougoing towork anEqualization ofOpportunity

Billforliterature, Ralph?” asked Mort Uddy. “That's anewone
onme.”
“Myname isRalph,” saidEubank angrily. “And it’sanewone
onyoubecause it’smyown idea.”
“Okay, okay. I’mnotquarreling, am1?I’mjustasking.” Mort
Liddy smiled. Hespent most ofhistime smiling nervously. Hewas
acomposer whowrote old-fashioned scores formotion pictures, and
modern symphonies forsparse audiences.
“Itwould work very simply,” saidBalph Eubank. “There should
bealawlimiting thesaleofanybook totenthousand copies. This
would throw theliterary market open tonew talent, fresh ideasand
non-commercial writing. Ifpeople were forbidden tobuyamillion
copies ofthesame piece oftrash, theywould beforced tobuybet-
terbooks.”
“You’ve gotsomething there,” saidMort Liddy. “But wouldn’t it
bekinda tough onthewriters' bank accounts?”
“Somuch thebetter. Only those whose motive isnotmoneymak-
ingshould beallowed towrite.”
“But, Mr.Eubank,” asked theyoung girlinthewhite dress, “what
ifmore than tenthousand people want tobuyacertain book?”
‘Ten thousand readers isenough foranyhook.”
‘That’s notwhat Imean. 1mean, what iftheywant it?”
“That isirrelevant.”
“But ifabook hasagood storywhich—”
“Plot isaprimitive vulgarity inliterature,” saidBalph Eubank
contemptuously.
Dr. Pritchett, onhiswayacross theroom tothebar,stopped to
say,“Quite so.Just aslogic isaprimitive vulgarity inphilosophy.”
“Just asmelody isaprimitive vulgarity inmusic,” saidMort Liddy.
“What’s allthisnoise?” asked Lillian Rcarden, glittering toastop
beside them.
“Lillian, myangel.” Balph Eubank drawled, “did 1tellyouthat
Pmdedicating mynewnovel toyou?”
“Why, thank you, darling.”
“What isthename ofyournewnovel?” asked thewealthy woman.
"'The Heart IsaMilkman
“What isitabout?”
“Frustration.”
“But, Mr.Eubank,” asked theyoung girlinthewhite dress, blush-
ingdesperately, “ifeverything isfrustration, what isthere tolive
for?”
“Brother-love,” saidBalph Eubank grimly.
Bertram Scudder stood slouched against thebar.Hislong, thin

Hank Reardon stood atawindow inadimrecess attheendof
thedrawing room. Hehoped noonewould notice him forafew
minutes. Hehad justescaped from amiddle-aged woman whohad
been telling himabout herpsychic experiences. Hestood, looking
out.Far inthedistance, theredglow ofReardon Steelmoved in
thesky.Hewatched itforamoment’s relief.
Heturned tolook atthedrawing room.Hehadnever liked his
house; ithadbeen Lillian’s choice. Buttonight, theshifting colors
oftheevening dresses drowned outtheappearance oftheroom and
gave itanairofbrilliant gaiety. Heliked toseepeople being gay,
even though hedidnotunderstand this particular manner of
enjoyment.
Helooked attheflowers, atthesparks oflightonthecrystal
glasses, atthenaked arms andshoulders ofwomen. There wasa
coldwind outside, sweeping empty stretches ofland.Hesawthethin
branches ofatreebeing twisted, likearmswaving inanappeal for
help. 'Hie treestood against theglow ofthe mills.
1lecould notname hissudden emotion. Hehadnowords tostate
itscause, itsquality, itsmeaning. Some part otitwasjoy,but itwas
solemn liketheactofbaring one’s head—hedidnotknow towhom.
When hestepped hack into thecrowd, hewas smiling. Butthe
smile vanished abruptly; hesaw'theentrance ofartew guest; itwas
Dagny Taggart.
Lillian moved forward tomeet her,studying herwith curiosity. They
hadmetbefore, oninfrequent occasions, andshefound itstrange to
seeDagny Taggart wearing anevening gown. Itwas ablack dress
withabodice that fellasacape overonearmandshoulder, leaving
theother bare; thenaked shoulder wasthegown's onlyornament.
Seeing herinthesuits shewore, onenever thought ofDagny Tag-
gart's body.Theblack dressseemed excessively revealing—because
itwasastonishing todiscover that thelines ofhershoulder were
fragile andbeautiful, andthatthediamond band onthewrist ofher
naked armgave herthemost feminine ofallaspects: thelook of
being chained.
“Miss Taggart, itissuch awonderful surprise toseeyouhere,”
said Lillian Rearden. themuscles ofherfaceperforming themotions
ofasmile, “Ihadnotreally dared tohope thataninvitation from
mewould takeyouaway fromyour eversomuch weightier concerns.
Dopermit metofeel flattered.”
James Taggart hadentered with hissistet. Lillian smiled athim, in
themanner ofahasty postscript, asifnoticing him forthe firsttime.
“Hello, James. That’s your penalty forbeing popular—onetends
tolose sight ofyou inthesurprise ofseeing your sister,”
“Noonecanmatch you inpopularity, Lillian,” heanswered, smil-
ingthinly, “nor ever lose sight ofyou.”
131
“Me? Oh,but Iamquite resigned totaking second place inthe
shadow ofmyhusband. Iamhumbly aware thatthewifeofagreat
manhastobecontented with reflected glory-— don't youthink so,
MissTaggart?”
“No/’ saidDagny, “1don’t.”
“Isthisacompliment orareproach. MissTaggart? Butdoforgive
meifIconfessFmhelpless. Whom may Ipresent toyou?Fmafraid
Ihave nothing butwriters and artists tootter, andtheywouldn’t
interest you,Fmsure.”
“Fd like tofindHank andsayhello tohim,”
“But ofcourse. James, doyouremember yousaidyouwanted to
meet Balph Eubank?—ohyes, he’shere—Fll tellhim that Iheard
youraveabout hislastnovel atMrs.Whitcomb’s dinner!”
Walking across theroom, Dagny wondered whyshehadsaidthat
shewanted tofindHank Rearden, what hadprevented herfrom
admitting thatshehadseenhimthemoment sheentered.
Rearden stood attheother endofthelongroom, looking ather.
Hewatched herassheapproached, buthedidnotstepforward to
meet her.
“Hello, Hank.”
“Good evening.”
Hebowed, courteously, impersonally, themovement othisbody
matching thedistinguished formality ofhisclothes. Hedidnotsmile.
“Thank you forinviting metonight.” shesaid gaily.
“Icannot claim that Iknew youwere coming.”
“Oh? Then I’mglad thatMrs.Rearden thought ofme. Iwanted
tomake anexception.”
“Anexception?”
“1don’t gotoparties very often.”
“Iampleased thatyouchose thisoccasion astheexception.” He
didnotadd“Miss Taggart,” but itsounded asifhehad.
Theformality ofhismanner wassounexpected thatshewasun-
able toadjust to it.“Iwanted tocelebrate,” shesaid.
“Tocelebrate mywedding anniversary?”
“Oh, isityourwedding anniversary? Ididn’t know.Mycongratu-
lations. Hank,”
“What didyouwish tocelebrate?”
“Ithought Fdpermit myself arest.Acelebration ofmyown—in
yourhonor andmine.”
“Forwhat reason?”
Sbewasthinking ofthenew track ontherocky grades ofthe
Colorado mountains, growing slowly toward thedistant goal ofthe
Wyatt oilfields. Shewasseeing thegreenish-blue glow ofthe rails
onthefrozen ground, among thedried weeds, thenaked' boulders,
therotting shanties ofhalf-starved settlements.
“Inhonor ofthe first sixty miles ofRearden Metal t£ack,” she
answered.
“Iappreciate it.”Thetone ofhisvoice wastheone fiatwould
havebeen proper ifhehad said, “I’ve never heard ofit.?
Shefound nothing elsetosay.She feltasifshewere speaking to
astranger.
132
“Why, MissTaggart!” acheerful voice broke their silence. “Now
this iswhat Imeanwhen lsaythatHank Rearden canachieve
anymiracle!”
Abusinessman whom theyknewhadapproached, smiling atherin
delighted astonishment. Thethree ofthemhadoften heldemergency
conferences about freight ratesand steel deliveries. Nowhelooked
ather, hisfaceanopencomment onthechange inherappearance,
thechange, shethought, which Rearden hadnotnoticed.
Shelaughed, answering theman’s greeting, giving herself notime
torecognize theunexpected stabofdisappointment, theunadmitted
thought thatshewished shehadseen thislookonRearden’s face,
instead. Sheexchanged afewsentences with theroan.When she
glanced around, Rearden wasgone.
“So that is>our famous sister?” saidBalph Eubank toJames
Taggart, looking atDagny across theroom.
“Iwasnotaware thatmysisterwasfamous,” saidTaggart, afaint
bite inhisvoice.
“But,mygood man, she’s anunusual phenomenon intheheldof
economics, soyoumust expect people totalkabout her.Your sister
isasymptom ofthe illness ofourcentury. Adecadent product of
themachine age.Machines have destroyed man’s humanity, taken
himaway from the soil,robbed himofhisnatural arts, killed his
soulandturned himintoaninsensitive robot. There’s anexample
ofit—awoman whoruns arailroad, instead ofpracticing thebeauti-
fulcraft ofthehandloom andbearing children.”
Rearden moved among theguests, trying nottobetrapped into
conversation Helooked attheroom; hesawnoonehewished
toapproach.
“Say,Hank Rearden, you’re notsuch abadfellow atallwhen
seen close upinthelion'sown den.Youought togiveusapress
conference once inawhile, you’d winusover.”
Rearden turned andlooked atthespeaker incredulously. Itwasa
young newspaperman oftheseedier sort,whoworked onaradical
tabloid. Iheoffensive familiarity ofhismanner seemed toimply that
hechose toberude toRearden because heknew thatRearden
should never have permitted himself toassociate with amanofhis
kind.
Rearden would nothave allowed himinside themills; buttheman
was Lillian’s guest; hecontrolled himself: heasked dryly, “What do
youwant?”
“You’re notsobad.You’ve gottalent. Technological talent. But.
ofcourse, Idon’t agree withyouabout Rearden Metal.”
“Ihaven’t asked you toagree.”
“Well, Bertram Scudder said thatyourpolicy—” theman started
belligerently, pointing toward thebar,butstopped, asifhehad slid
farther thanheintended.
Rearden looked attheuntidy figure slouched against thebar. Lil-
lianhadintroduced them, buthehadpaidnoattention tothename.
Heturned sharply andwalked off, inamanner thatforbade the
youngbum totaghim.
Lillian glanced upathisface,when Rearden approached herin
133
themidst ofagroup, and,without aword, stepped asidewhere they
could notbeheard.
“IsthatScudder ofTheFutureT
yheasked, pointing.
“Why, yes.”
Helooked athersilently, unable tobegin tobelieve it,unable to
findtheleadofathought withwhich tobegin tounderstand. Her
eyeswere watching him.
“How could youinvite himhere?" heasked.
“Now, Henry, don't let'sberidiculous. Youdon’t want tobenarrow-
minded, doyou?Youmust learn totolerate theopinions ofothers
andrespect their right offreespeech.”
“Inmyhouse?”
“Oh, don't bestuffy!”
Hedidnotspeak, because bisconsciousness washeld, notbyco-
herent statements, butbytwopictures thatseemed toglare athim
insistently. Hesawthearticle, “The Octopus,” byBertram Scudder,
which wasnotanexpression ofideas, butabucket ofslime emptied
inpublic— anarticle thatdidnotcontain asingle fact,notevenan
invented one, butpoured astream ofsneers andadjectives inwhich
nothing wasdear except the filthy malice ofdenouncing without
considering proof necessary. Andhesawthelines ofLillian's profile,
theproud purity which hehadsought inmarrying her.
When henoticed heragain, herealized that thevision ofher
profile was inhisownmind, because shewasturned tohim fullface,
watching him. Inthesudden instant ofreturning toreality, he
thought thatwhat hesaw inhereyeswasenjoyment. Butmthe
next instant hereminded himself thathewassaneandthat thiswas
notpossible.
“It's the firsttimeyou've invited that . ..”heusedanobscene
word withunemotional precision, “tomyhouse. It'sthelast."
“How dareyouusesuch-—"
“Don't argue, Lillian. Ifyoudo.HIthrow himoutrightnow"
Hegave -heramoment toanswer, toobject, toscream athim if
shewished. Sheremained silent, notlooking athim.onlyhersmooth
cheeks seemed faintly drawn inward, as ildeflated
Moving blindly away through thecoils oflights, voices andper-
fume, hefeltacoldtouch ofdread. Heknew thatheshould think
ofLillian andfindtheanswer totheriddle ofhercharacter, because
thiswasarevelation which hecould notignore; buthedidnotthink
ofher—andhefeltthedread because heknew thattheanswer had
ceased tomatter tohimlong ago.
The flood ofweariness wasstarting toriseagain.He feltasifhe
could almost see itinthickening waves; itwasnotwithin him. but
outside, spreading through theroom. Foraninstant, hefeltasifhe
were alone, lostinagray desert, needing helpand kno\*ji ngthatno
helpwould come.
Hestopped short. Inthelighted doorway, thelength dftheroom
between them, hesawthe tall,arrogant figure ofamtlnwhohad
paused foramoment before entering. Hehadnever m|ttheman,
butofallthenotorious faces thatcluttered thepages ofNewspapers,
thiswastheonehedespised. ItwasFrancisco d’Anconik
134
Rearden hadnever givenmuch thought tomen likeBertram Scud-
der.Butwithevery hour ofhis life,withthestrain andthepride of
everymoment when hismuscles orhismindhadached from effort,
withevery stephehadtaken toriseoutofthemines ofMinnesota
andtoturn hiseffort into gold, with allofhisprofound respect for
money andfor itsmeaning, hedespised thesquanderer whodidnot
knowhow todeserve thegreat giftofinherited wealth. There, he
thought, wasthemost contemptible representative ofthespecies.
HesawFrancisco d’Anconia enter,bow toLillian, thenwalk into
thecrowd asifheowned theroom which hehadnever entered
betore. Heads turned towatch him, asifhepulled themonstrings
inhiswake.
Approaching Lillian oncemore, Rearden saidwithout anger, the
contempt becoming amusement inhisvoice, “Tdidn’t know you
knew thatone.”
‘Tvemethim atafewparties.”
“Isheoneofyour friends, too?'*
“Certainly not!”Thesharp resentment wasgenuine.
“Then whydidyou invite him?”
“Well, youcan't giveaparty—notaparty thatcounts—while he’s
inthiscountry, without inviting him. It’sanuisance ithecomes, and
asocial black mark ifhedoesn’t.”
Rearden laughed. Shewas offguard; shedidnotusually admit
things ofthiskind, “Look,” hesaid wearily, “Idon’t want tospoil
your party. Butkeep thatmanaway from me.Don’t come around
with introductions. Idon’t want tomeet him. Idon’tknow how
you’ll work that, butyou’re anexpert hostess, sowork it.”
Dagny stood stillwhen shesawFrancisco approaching. Hebowed
toherashepassed by.Hedidnotstop, butsheknew thathehad
stopped themoment inhismind. Shesawhimsmile faintly indelib-
etate emphasis ofwhat heunderstood anddidnotchoose toac-
knowledge. Sheturned away. Shehoped toavoid him fortherest
oftheevening.
Balph Eubank hadjoined thegroup around Dr.Pritchett, andwas
saying, sullenly, “.. .no,youcannot expect people tounderstand
thehigher reaches ofphilosophy. Culture should betaken outofthe
hands ofthedollar-chasers. Weneed anational subsidy forliterature.
Itisdisgraceful that artists aretreated likepeddlers and that art
works have tobesold likesoap.”
“You mean, your complaint isthatthey don't sell likesoap?”
asked Francisco d’Anconia.
1'heyhadnotnoticed himapptoach; theconversation stopped, as
ifslashed off;most ofthem hadnever methim,butthey allrecog-
nized him atonce.
“Imeant—”Balph Eubank started angrily andclosed hismouth;
hesawtheeager interest onthefaces ofhisaudience, but itwas
notinterest inphilosophy anylonger.
“Why, hello. Professor!” said Francisco, bowing toDr.Pritchett
There wasnopleasure inDr,Pritchett’s facewhen beanswered
thegreeting andperformed afewintroductions.
135
“Wewere justdiscussing amost interesting subject,” saidtheear-
nestmatron* “Dr. Pritchett was telling usthatnothing isanything.”
“He should, undoubtedly, know more thananyone elseabout
that,” Francisco answered gravely.
“Iwouldn’t havesupposed thatyouknew Dr.Pritchett sowell,
Sefior d’Anconia,” shesaid,andwondered whytheprofessor looked
displeased byherremark.
“Iamanalumnus ofthegreat school thatemploys Dr.Pritchett
atpresent, thePatrick Henry University. But lstudied under oneof
hispredecessors —Hugh Akston.”
“Hugh Akston!” theattractive young woman gasped. “But you
couldn’t have, Sefior d’Anconta! You're notoldenough. 1thought
hewasoneofthose greatnames of ...ofthelastcentury.”
“Perhaps inspirit, madame. Not infact.”
“But Ithought hedied years ago.”
“Why, no.He’s stillalive.”
“Then whydon’tweeverhearabout himanymore?”
“He retired, nineyears ago.”
“Isn’t itodd?When apolitician oramovie star retires, weread
frontpage stories about it.Butwhen aphilosopher retires, people
donoteven notice it.”
“They do,eventually.”
Ayoung man said, astonished. “1thought Hugh Akston wasone
ofthose classics thatnobody studied anymore, exceptmhistories
ofphilosophy. Ireadanarticle recently which referred tohimasthe
lastofthegreat advocates ofreason.”
“Just what didHugh Akston teach?” asked theearnest matron.
Francisco answered, “He taught thateverything issomething.”
“Your loyalty toyour teacher islaudable, Sefior d’Anconia.” said
Dr.Pritchett dryly.“Maywetake itthatyouareanexample ofthe
practical results ofhisteaching?”
“Iam.”,
James Taggart hadapproached thegroup andwaswaiting tobe
noticed.
“Hello, Francisco.”
“Good evening, James.”
“What awonderful coincidence, seeing youhere! I’vebeen very
anxious tospeak toyou.”
“Thai’s new.You haven’t always been.”
“Now you’re joking, just like intheolddays,” Taggart wasmoving
slowly, asifcasually, awayfrom thegroup, hoping todraw Francisco
after him.“You know that there’s notaperson inthisroomwho
wouldn’t love totalktoyou.”
“Really? I’dheinclined tosuspect theopposite.” Fr$ncisco had
followed obediently, butstopped within hearing distance ofthe
others.
“Ihave tried inevery possible waytogetintouch willyou,” said
Taggart, “but ...butcircumstances didn’t permit met4succeed.”
“Are you trying tohidefrommethefact that Irefused tosee
you?”
“Well ...that is... Imean, whydidyourefuse?”
136
“Icouldn’t imagine whatyouwanted tospeak tomeabout.”
‘TheSanSebastian Mines, ofcourse!” Taggart’s voice rosealittle.
“Why, what about them?”
“But .. .Now, look, Francisco, this isserious. It’sadisaster, an
unprecedented disaster—andnobody canmake anysense outofit.
1don’tknow what tothink. Idon’t understand itatall. Ihave a
right toknow.”
“Aright? Aren’t youbeing old-fashioned, James? Butwhat isit
youwant toknow?”
“Well, firstofall,thatnationalization —what areyougoing todo
about it?”
“Nothing.”
“Nothing?!”
“But surely youdon’t wantmetodoanything about it.Mymines
andyour railroad were seized bythewillofthepeople. Youwouldn’t
wantmetooppose the willotthepeople, would you?”
“Francisco, this isnotalaughing matter!”
“Inever thought itwas.”
“I’m entitled toanexplanation! Youoweyour stockholders an
account ofthewhole disgraceful affair!Why didyoupick aworthless
mine?Why didyouwaste ailthose millions? What sort otrotten
swindle was it?”
Francisco stood looking athim inpolite astonishment. “Why,
James,” hesaid, “lthought youwould approve ofit.”
“Approve?!”
“Ithought youwould consider theSanSebastian Mines asthe
practical realization ofanideal ofthehighest moral order.Remem-
bering thatyouand Ihave disagreed sooften inthepast, Ithought
youwould begratified toseemeacting inaccordance withyour
principles.”
“What areyoutalking about?”
Francisco shook hishead regretfully. “Idon't know whyyou
should callmybehavior rotten. 1thought youwould recognize itas
anhonest effort topractice what thewhole world ispreaching.
Doesn’t everyone believe that itiseviltobeselfish? Iwas totally
sellless inregard totheSanSebastian project. Isn’t iteviltopursue
apersonal interest? Ihadnopersonal interest initwhatever. Isn’t it
eviltowork torprofit? 1didnotwork forprofit—Itookaloss.Doesn’t
everyone agree that thepurpose and justification ofanindustrial
enterprise arenotproduction, butthelivelihood ofitsemployees?
TheSanSebastian Mines were themost eminently successful venture
inindustrial history: theyproduced nocopper, buttheyprovided a
livelihood forthousands ofmenwhocould nothave achieved ina
lifetime, theequivalent ofwhat they gotforoneday’s work, which
theycould notdo.Isn’t itgenerally agreed thatanowner isaparasite
andanexploiter, that itistheemployees whodoallthework and

believe that inorder togetthegoods, ailyouhave todoisneed

gratitude andacitation ofhonor. Idonotunderstand why Iam
being damned,”
Inthesilence ofthosewhohad listened, thesolecomment was
the shrill, sudden giggle ofBetty Pope' shehadunderstood nothing,
butshesawthelookofhelpless furyonJames Taggart’s face.
People were looking atTaggart, expecting ananswer. They were
indifferent totheissue, theywere merely amused bythespectacle
ofsomeone’s embarrassment. Taggart achieved apatronizing smile.
“You don’t expect metotake thisseriously?” heasked.
“There wasatime,” Francisco answered, “when 1didnotbelieve
thatanyone could take itseriously. Iwaswrong.”
“This isoutrageous!” Taggart’s voice started torise. “It's perfectly
outrageous totreatyour public responsibilities withsuch thoughtless
levity!” Heturned tohurry away.
Francisco shrugged, spreading hishands. “You sec? Ididn't think
youwanted tospeak tome.”
Reardcn stood alone, farattheother endoftheroom Philip
noticed him,approached andwaved toLillian, calling herover.
“Lillian, Idon’t think thatHenry ishaving agood time,” hesaid,
smiling; onecould not tellwhether themockery othissmile was
directed atLillian oratRearden. “Can’t wedosomething about it?”
“Oh, nonsense!” saidRearden
“1wish Iknew what todoabout it,Philip,” said Lillian. “I've
always wished Henry would learn torelax. He’s sogrimly serious
about everything. He’ssuch arigid Puritan. I’vealways wanted tosee
himdrunk, justonce, Bui I’vegiven up.What would yousuggest?”
“Oh. Idon't know! Butheshouldn’t bestanding around allby
himself.” #
“Drop it.”saidRearden. While thinking dimly thathedidnot
want tohurl their feelings, hecould notprevent himself from adding,
“You don’tknowhow hard I’ve tried tobeleftstanding allby
myself.”
“There—yousee?” Lillian smiled atPhilip.*Toenjoy lifeand
people isnotsosimple aspouring atonofsteel. Intellectual pursuits
arenotlearned inthemarket place.”
Philip chuckled. “It’s notintellectual pursuits I’mworried about.
How sure areyouabout thatPuritan stuff, Lillian? (fIwere you, 1
wouldn’t leavehim freetolookaround. There aretoomany beauti-
fulwomen here tonight.”
“Henry entertaining thoughts ofinfidelity? You flatterihim, Philip.
You overestimate hiscourage.” Shesmiled atKeardeii coldly, for
abrief, stressed moment, thenmoved away.
Rearden looked athisbrother. “What inhell dc<you think
you're doing?”
“Oh, stopplaying thePuritan! Can’t youtakeajoke?”
Moving aimlessly through thecrowd, Dagny wondered whyshe
hadaccepted theinvitation tothisparty. Theanswer astonished her:
138
itwasbecause shehadwanted toseeHank Rearden. Watching him
inthecrowd* sherealized thecontrast forthe firsttime.The faces
oftheothers looked likeaggregates ofinterchangeable features,
every faceoozing toblend intotheanonymity ofresembling all,and
alllooking asiftheywere melting. Rearden’s face, with thesharp
planes, thepaleblue eyes, theash-blond hair,hadthefirmness of
ice;theuncompromising clarity ofitslinesmade itlook,among the
others, asifheweremoving through afog, hitbyarayoflight.
Hereyes kept returning tohim involuntarily. Shenever caught
himglancing inherdirection. Shecould notbelieve thathewas
avoiding herintentionally; there could benopossible reason for it;
yetshe feltcertain thathewas.Shewanted toapproach himand
convince herself thatshewasmistaken. Something stopped her;she
could notunderstand herown reluctance.
Rearden bore patiently aconversation with hismother andtwo
ladieswhom shewished him toentertain with stones ofhisyouth
and hisstruggle. Hecomplied, telling himself thatshewasproud of
him inherownway, Buthefeltasifsomething inhermanner kept
suggesting thatshehadnursed himthrough hisstruggle andthatshe
wasthesource ofhissuccess. Hewasgladwhen she lethim go.
Then heescaped oncemore totherecess ofthewindow.
Hestood there forawhile, leaning onasense ofprivacy asifit
were aphysical support
‘’Mr. Rearden," said astrangely quiet voice beside him, ’permit
metointroduce myself. Myname isd'Anconia.”
Rearden turned, startled; d'Aneonia's manner andvoice had a
quality hehadseldom encountered before: alone ofauthentic
respect
‘How doyoudo," heanswered. Hisvoice wasbrusque anddry;
buthehadanswered.
“1haveobserved thatMrs.Rearden hasbeen trying toavoid the
necessity ofpresenting metoyou.and 1canguess thereason. Would
youprefer that Ileave yourhouse7"
7heaction ofnaming anissue instead ofevading it.wassounlike
theusual behavior ofallthemen heknew, itwassuch asudden,
stailling relief, thatRearden remained silent foramoment, studying
d'Anconia’s face. Francisco hadsaid itvery simply, neither asare-
proach noraplea, but inamanner which, strangely, acknowledged
Reardon’s dignity and hisown.
“No," saidRearden. “whatever elseyouguessed, ididnotsay
that.”
“thank you. Inthat case,you willallowmetospeak toyou.”
“Why should youwish tospeak tome?”
“My motives cannot interest you atpresent.”
“Mine isnotthesortofconversation thatcould interest you at
all.”
“You aremistaken about oneofus,Mr.Rearden, orboth. Icame
tothisparty solely inorder tomeet you,”
There hadbeen ataint tone ofamusement inRearden's voice;
now ithardened intoahintofcontempt. “You started byplaying it
straight. Stick toit.”
139
“Iam.”
”What didyouwant tomeetmefor? Inorder tomakemelose
money?”
Francisco looked straight athim.“Yes—eventually.”
“What isit,thistime?Agoldmine?”
Francisco shook hishead slowly; theconscious deliberation ofthe
movement gave itanairthatwasalmost sadness. “No,” hesaid, “I
don’twant tosellyouanything. Asamatter offact, Ididnotattempt
tosellthecopper mine toJames Taggart, either. Hecame tomefor
it.Youwon’t.”
Rearden chuckled. “Ifyouunderstand thatmuch, wehave atleast
asensible basis forconversation. Proceed onthat. Ifyoudon’t have
some fancy investment inmind, what didyouwant tomeetmefor?”
“Inorder tobecome acquainted withyou.”
“That's notananswer. It’sjustanother wayofsaying thesame
thing.”
“Not quite, Mr.Rearden.”
“Unless youmean—inorder togainmyconfidence?”
“No. Idon’t likepeople whospeak orthink interms ofgaining
anybody’s confidence. Ifone’s actions arehonest, onedoes notneed
thepredated confidence ofothers, only their rational perception. The
person who craves amoral blank check ofthat kind, hasdishonest
intentions, whether headmits ittohimself ornot."
Rearden’s startled glance athimwas liketheinvoluntary thrust
ofahand grasping forsupport inadesperate need.Theglance be-
trayed howfmuch hewanted tofindthesoitofmanhethought he
was seeing. Then Rearden lowered hise>es; almost closing them,
slowly, shutting outthevision andtheneed. Hisfacewashard, it
hadanexpression ofseverity, aninner seventy directed athimself;
itlooked austere andlonely.
“All right," hesaid tonelessly. “What doyouwant, ifit'snot
myconfidence?”
“1want'to learn tounderstand you.”
“What for?”
“For areason ofmyownwhich need notconcern you atpresent.”
“What doyouwant tounderstand aboutme?”
Francisco looked silently outatthedarkness. The lireofthemills
wasdying down. There wasonly afaint tinge ofred leftontheedge
oftheearth, justenough tooutline thescraps ofclouds ripped by
thetortured battle ofthestorm inthesky.Dimshapes keptsweeping
through space and vanishing, shapes which were branches, but
looked asiftheywere thefuryofthewindmade visible.
“It’s aterrible night foranyanimal caught unprotected onthat
plain,” saidFrancisco d’Anconia. “This iswhen oneshould appreci-
atethemeaning ofbeing aman.”
Rearden didnotanswer foramoment; thenhesaid,asifinanswer
tohimself, atone ofwonder inhisvoice, “Funny . .
“What?”
“You toldmewhat Iwasthinking justawhile ago .
“You were?”
“...only Ididn’t have thewords for it.”
140
“Shall Itellyoutherestofthewords?”
“Goahead.”
“You stood hereandwatched thestorm with thegreatest pride
onecaneverfeel— because youareable tohavesummer flowers
and half-nakedwomen inyourhouse onanight like this, indemon-
stration ofyour victory over thatstorm. And ifitweren’t foryou,
most ofthosewho areherewould belefthelpless atthemercy of
thatwind inthemiddle ofsome such plain.”
“How didyouknow that?”
Intime with hisquestion, Rearden realized that itwasnothis
thoughts thismanhadnamed, buthismost hidden, most personal
emotion; andthathe,whowould never confess hisemotions toany-
one,hadconfessed itinhisquestion. Hesawthefaintest flicker in
Francisco’s eyes, asofasmile oracheck mark.
“What would vouknow about apride ofthatkind?” Rearden
asked sharply, asifthecontempt ofthesecond question could erase
theconfidence ofthe first.
“That iswhat 1feltonce,when Iwasyoung.”
Rearden looked athim.There wasneither mockery norself-pity
inFrancisco’s face; the fine, sculptured planes andthedear, blue
eyes held aquiet composure, thefacewasopen, offered toany
blow, unflinching.
“Why doyouwant totalkabout it?”Rearden asked, prompted
byamoment’s reluctant compassion.
“Let ussay—bywayofgratitude, Mr.Rearden.”
“Gratitude tome?”
“Ifyou willaccept it.”
Rearden’s voice hardened. “Ihaven’t asked forgratitude. 1don't
need it.”
“1have notsaidyouneeded it.Butofallthosewhom youare
saving Irom thestorm tonight, lamtheonlyonewho willoffer it.”
After amoment’s silence, Rearden asked, hisvoice lowwith a
sound which wasalmost athreat. “What areyoutrying todo?”
“1amcalling your attention tothenature ofthose forwhom you
areworking.”
“Itwould take amanwho’s never done anhonest day’swork in
hislife,tothink orsaythat.” Thecontempt inRearden’s voice had
anote ofrelief; hehadbeen disarmed byadoubt ofhisjudgment
onthecharacter ofhisadversary; nowhefeltcertain once more.
“You wouldn’t understand itifltoldyouthatthemanwhoworks,
works forhimself, even ifhedoes carry thewhole wretched bunch
ofyoualong.Now illguess what you’re thinking: goahead, saythat
it’sevil, thatI’m selfish, conceited, heartless, cruel. 1am. Idon’t
want anypartofthat tripe about working forothers. I'mnot.”
Forthe firsttime, hesawthelook ofapersonal reaction iirFran-
cisco’s eyes, thelookofsomething eager andyoung. “The onlything
that’s wrong inwhat you said,” Francisco answered, “isthatyou
permit anyone tocall itevil.” InRearden’s pause ofincredulous
silence, hepointed atthecrowd inthedrawing room.“Why areyou
willing tocarrythem?”
“Because they’re abunch ofmiserable children who struggle to
141
remain alive, desperately andvery badly, while I—Idon't even notice
theburden."
"Why don’t you tellthem that?1'
"What?"
"That you’re working foryourown sake, nottheirs."
"They know it."
"Oh yes,theyknow it.Every single oneofthem hereknows it.
Butthey don’t think youdo.And theaimofalltheir efforts isto
keepyoufromknowing it."
"Why should Icarewhat theythink?”
"Because it’s—abattle inwhich onemustmake one’s stand clear.”
"Abattle? What battle? 1hold thewhip hand. Idon’t light the
disarmed.”
"Are they? They have aweapon against you. It'stheir only
weapon, but it'saterrible oneAskyourself what itis,some time.”
"Where doyouseeanyevidence ofit?”
"intheunforgivable factthatyou’re asunhappy asyouare.”
Kearden could accept anyform ofreproach, abuse, damnation
anyone chose tothrow athim: theonlyhuman reaction which he
would notaccept was pity.The slab ofacoldly rebellious anger
brought himback tothe fullcontext ofthemoment Hespoke,
fighting nottoacknowledge thenature oftheemotion rising within
him."What sortofeffrontery areyouindulging m?What’s your
motive?”
“Let ussay -togiveyouthewords youneed, forthetimewhen
you’ll need them.”
“Why should youwant tospeak tomeonsuch asubject?"
‘Inthehope thatyou willremember it.”
What hefelt,thought Rearden, wasanger attheincomprehensible
factthathehadallowed himself toenjoy thisconversation. Hefell
adimsense ofbetrayal, thehint ofanunknown danger. “Doyou
expect metoforget whatyou are?*' heasked, knowing that thiswas
what hehadforgotten,
“1donotexpect youtothink ofmeatall.”
Under hisanger, theemotion which Rearden would notacknowl-
edgeremained unstated andunlhought; heknew itonly asahintof
pain.Hadhefaced it,hewould haveknown thathe stillheard
Francisco’s voice saying, “1amtheonlyonewho willoffer it... if
you willaccept it. ...”Heheard thewords andthestrangely solemn
inflection ofthequiet voice andaninexplicable answer olhisown,
something within him thatwanted tocryyes. toaccept, totellthis
man thatheaccepted, thatheneeded it—though there wasnoname
forwhat heneeded, itwasnotgratitude, andheknew that itwas
notgratitude thismanhadmeant.
Aloud, hesaid, “Ididn’t seek totalktoyou.Butyou’ve asked

“That istrue."
"Icanforgive allthose others, they’re notvicious, they’re merely

"It isagainst thesinofforgiveness that Iwanted to

Dagny stood bythecorner ofthewindow recess, listening. They
didnotnotice her.Shehadseenthem together andshehadap-
proached, drawn byanimpulse shecould notexplain orresist; it
seemed crucially important thatsheknow what these twomen said
toeach other.
Shehadheard their lastfewsentences. Shehadnever thought it
possible thatshewould seeFrancisco taking abeating. Hecould
smash anyadversary inanyform ofencounter. Yethestood, offering
nodefense. Sheknew that itwasnotindifference; sheknew hisface

“Then what right haveyoutotalkabout themeaning ofbeing a

Francisco bowed andturned togo.Rearden said involuntarily, not
knowing thatthequestion negated hisanger, that itwasaplea to
stop thismanandhold him,“What didyouwant tolearn tounder-
stand aboutme?”
Francisco turned. Theexpression ofhisfacehadnotchanged; it
was stillalook ofgravely courteous respect. “Ihave learned it/’
heanswered.
Rearden stood watching himashewalked offintothecrowd. The
figures ofabutler, withacrystal dish,andofDr.Pritchett, stooping
tochoose another canape, hidFrancisco from sight. Rearden glanced
outatthedarkness; nothing could beseen there butthewind.
Dagny stepped forward, when hecame outoftherecess; she
smiled, openly inviting conversation. Hestopped. Itseemed toher
thathehadstopped reluctantly. Shespoke hastily, tobreak the si-
lence. “Hank, whydoyouhave somany intellectuals ofthelooter
persuasion here? Iwouldn’t havethem inmyhouse.”
Thiswasnotwhat shehadwanted tosaytohim.Butshedidnot
know what shewanted tosay;never before hadshe feltherself left
wordless inhispresence.
Shesaw hiseyes narrowing, likead<x>r being closed. “Iseeno

coldly.

“Ihave never thought ofit.”
Shecould notadapt herwords totherigid formality ofhismanner;
shecould notquite believe it.They hadalways been atease together,
inhisoflice.Now hewas likeaman inastrait jacket.
“Hank, look atit.Ifyoudidn't know anyofthese people, wouldn’t

Shedidnotnotice thathehadnotfollowed herglance. Hewas
looking down attheshadows onhernaked shoulder, thesoft, blue

“Why haveweleft italltofools? Itshould havebeen ours.”
“Inwhatmanner?”
“Idon’tknow ...I’vealways expected parties tobeexciting and

sadness init,“But Idon't drink, either. That’s justanother symbol
thatdoesn’t mean what itwasintended tomean.” Hewas silent.
Sheadded, “Perhaps there's something thatwehave missed.”
“Iamnotaware ofit.”
Inaflash ofsudden, desolate emptiness, shewasglad thathehad
notunderstood orresponded, feeling dimly thatshehadrevealed
toomuch, yetnotknowing what shehadrevealed. Sheshrugged,
themovement running through thecurve ofhershoulder likeafaint

“Just amood thatcomes once every year ortwo, Letmeseethe

Shemoved slowly through theroom, looking atnoonip.Sheno-

“Idonotknow why, but Iamgrowing tobeafraid ofthedark.

Night assuch.”
Thespeaker wasanelderly spinster withanairofbreeding and
hopelessness. Thethreewomen andtwomenofthegroup were well
dressed, theskinoftheir faceswassmoothly welltended, butthey
hadamanner ofanxious caution thatkept their voices onetone
lower thannormal andblurred thedifferences of(heir ages, giving
them allthesame graylook ofbeing spent. Itwasthelookonesaw
ingroups ofrespectable people everywhere. Dagny stopped and
listened.
“Butmydear,” oneofthem asked, “why should itfrighten you?”
“1don’t know.” saidthespinster. ”1amnotafraid ofprowlers or
robberies oranything ofthesort.But 1stayawake allnight. Ifall

“My cousin who livesonthecoast ofMaine wrotemethesame

“Why, no.” thespinster said indifferently. “Everybody down on

Coast Guard trying tocatch him.”
“Ragnar Danneskjdld inDelaware Bay?” awoman gasped.
“Oh, yes.They say itisnotthe firsttime.”
“Did they catch him?”
“No.”
“Nobody cancatch him,” saidoneofthemen,

146
“But 1doknow it,”saidthewoman, inthesoft,mysterious tone
ofsharing asecret.
“Youknow what?”
“1knowwho isJohn Galt.”
“Who?” Dagny asked tensely, stopping.
“Iknow amanwhoknew John GaJt inperson. Thisman isan
oldfriend ofagreat-aunt ofmine.Hewasthere andhesaw it

“What?”
“Atlantis.”
“Why ...vaguely.”
“The isles oftheBlessed. That iswhat theGreeks called it,thou-
sands ofyears ago.They saidAtlantis wasaplace where hero-spirits
lived inahappiness unknown totherestoftheearth.Aplace which
only the spirits ofheroes could enter, andtheyreached itwithout
dying, because they carried thesecret oflifewithin them. Atlantis
was losttomankind, even then. ButtheGreeks knew that ithad
existed. They tried tofind it.Some ofthem said itwasunderground,
hidden intheheart oftheearth. Butmost ofthem said itwasan
island.Aradiant island intheWestern Ocean. Perhaps what they
were thinking ofwasAmerica. They never found it.Forcenturies
afterward, men said itwasonly alegend. They didnotbelieve it,
buttheynever stopped looking for it.because theyknew that that
waswhat theyhadtofind.”
“Well, what about John Galt?”
“Hefound it.”
Dagny ’sinterest wasgone“Who washe?”
“John Galtwasamillionaire, aman ofinestimable wealth. He

“How mtciesting.”
“My friend saw itwith hisown eyes.” said thewoman, offended.
“Ithappened many years ago.ButJohn Galt’s family hushed up

“And whathappened tohisfortune? 1don’t recall ever hearing

“Itwentdown with him.” Sheadded belligerently, “You don’t

“Miss Taggart doesn't,” saidFrancisco d'Aticoiua. “Ido.”

“Have youever had faith inanything. Sefior d'Anconia?” the
woman asked angrily,
“No,madame?’

Hechuckled atherbrusque departure. Dagny asked coldly,
“What’s thejoke?”
“The joke’s onthatfoolwoman. Shedoesn't know thatshewas

“Doyouexpect metobelieve that?”
“No.”
“Then whatdoyou findsoamusing?”
“Oh, agreatmany things here. Don’t you?”

“Well, that's oneofthethings 1findamusing.”
“Francisco, willyouleavemealone?”
“But Ihave. Didn't younotice thatyouwere first tospeak to

“Why doyoukeep watching me?”
“Curiosity.”

“Your reaction tothethings which youdon’t findamusing.”
“Why should youcareaboutmyreaction toanything?”
“That ismyownwayofhaving agood time, which, incidentally,
youarenothaving, areyou,Dagny? Besides, you’re theonlywoman
worth watching here.”
Shestood defiantly still,because thewayhelooked atherde-
manded anangry escape. Shestood asshealways did. straight and
taut,herhead lifted impatiently. Itwastheunfemmine pose ofan
executive. Buthernaked shoulder betrayed thefragility ofthehotly
under theblack dress, and theposemade hermost truly awoman.
Theproud strength became achallenge tosomeone's superior
strength, andthe fragility areminder that thechallenge could be
broken. Shewasnotconscious of it.Shehadmetnooneable to

Hesaid, looking down atherbody. “Dagny, what amagnificent

Shehadtoturnandescape. She feltherself blushing, forthe first
time inyeats: blushing because sheknew suddenly thatthesentence
named what shehad felt allevening.
She ran, trying nottothink. Themusic stopped her. Itwasa
sudden blast from the radio. Shenoticed Mort Liddy, whohad
turned iton,waving hisarms toagroup offriends, yelling. “That’s

The great burst ofsound was theopening chords ofHalley’s

ahandful ofmudandpebbles hadbeen flung atthemusic, andwhat
followed wasthesound ottherolling andthedripping. ItwasHal-
ley’sConcerto swung into apopular tune. ItwasHaller’s melody
torn apart, itsholes stuffed with hiccoughs. The great statement of
joyhadbecome thegiggling ofabarroom. Yet itwas st{lltherem-
nant ofHalley’s melody thatgave itform; itwasther^iclody that
supported itlikeaspinal cord.

Dagny stood, staring attheroom, asifonesense could replace
another, asifsight could wipe outsound. Shemoved herhead ina
slow circle, trying tofindananchor somewhere. ShesawFrancisco
leaning against acolumn, hisarms crossed; hewaslooking straight
ather;hewaslaughing.
Don't shake like this,shethought. Getoutofhere. Thiswasthe
approach ofananger shecould notcontrol. Shethought: Saynoth-
ing.Walk steadily. Get out.
Shehadstarted walking, cautiously, very slowly. Sheheard Lil-
lian’s words andstopped. Lillian hadsaid itmany times thisevening,
inanswer tothesame question, but itwasthe firsttime thatDagny
heard it.
'This?’* Lillian was saying, extending herarm with themetal
bracelet fortheinspection oftwosmartly groomed women. “Why,
no, it'snotfrom ahardware store, it’savery special giftfrommy
husband. Oh, yes,ofcourse it’shideous. Butdon't yousee? It’s
supposed tobepriceless. Ofcourse. I’dexchange itforacommon
diamond bracelet anytime, butsomehow nobody willoffermeone
for it,even though itissovery, very valuable. Why?Mydear, it’s
the firstthing evermade ofRearden Metal."
Dagny didnotseetheroom. Shedidnothear themusic. She felt
thepressure ofdead stillness against hereardrums. Shedidnotknow
themoment thatpreceded, orthemoments thatwere tofollow. She
didnotknow those involved, neither herself, nor Lillian, norRear-
den, northemeaning ofherown action. Itwas asingle instant,
blasted outofcontext. Shehadheard. Shewaslooking atthebrace-
letofgreen-blue metal.
She feltthemovement ofsomething being torn offherwrist, and
sheheard herownvoice saying in Ihegreat stillness, very calmly, a
voice cold asaskeleton, naked ofemotion, “Ifyouarenotthe
coward that Ithink you are,you willexchange it.”
Onthepalm ofherhand, shewasextending herdiamond bracelet
toLillian.
“You're notserious. MissTaggart?” saidawoman's voice.
Itwasnot Lillian's voice. Lillian's eyeswere looking straight at
her.Shesawthem. Lillian knew thatshewasserious.
“Givemethat bracelet,” saidDagny, lifting herpalm higher, the
diamond band glittering across it.
“This ishorrible!” criedsomewoman. Itwasstrange thatthecry
stood outsosharply. ThenDagny realized thatthere were people
standing around them and thatthey ailstood insilence. Shewas
hearing sounds now,even themusic: itwasHalley's mangled Con-
certo, somewhere faraway.
ShesawRearden’s face. Itlooked asifsomething within himwere
mangled, likethemusic; shedidnotknow bywhat.Hewaswatch-
ingthem.
Lillian’s mouth moved intoanupturned crescent. Itresembled a
smile. Shesnapped themetal bracelet open, dropped itonDagny ’s
palmandtook thediamond band.
149
“Thank you.Miss Taggart,*’ shesaid.
Dagny ’$fingers closed about themetal. She feltthat;shefeltnoth-
ingelse.
Lillian turned, because Rearden hadapproached her.Hetook the
diamond bracelet Irom herhand.Heclasped itonherwrist, raised
herhand tohislipsandkissed it.
Hedidnotlook atDagny.
Lillian laughed, gaily, easily, attractively, bringing theroom back
toitsnormal mood
“You mayhave itback. Miss Taggart, when youchange your
mind," shesaid.
Dagny hadturned away She feltcalmand free.Thepressure was
gone.Theneed togetouthadvanished.
Sheclasped themetal bracelet onherwrist. Sheliked thefeelof
theweight against herskin. Inexplicably, she feltatouch offeminine
vanity, thekindshehadnever experienced before: thedesire tobe
seenwearing thisparticular ornament.
From adistance, sheheard snatches ofindignant voices: “The
most offensive gesture I’veever seen. . .Itwas vicious. . .I’m
glad Lillian took herupon it. . . .Serves herright, itshefeels like
throwing afewthousand dollars away. .
Fortherestoftheevening. Rearden remained bythesideofhis
wife.Heshared herconversations, lielaughed with herfriends, he
wassuddenly thedevoted, attentive, admiring husband.
Hewascrossing theroom, carrying atrayofdrmks requested by
someone inLillian’s group—anunbecoming actoiinformality which
nobody hadeverseenhimperform- when Dagny approached him.
Shestopped andlooked upathim, asittheywere alone inhisoffice
Shestood likeanexecutive, herhead lifted.Helooked down ather.
Inthelineofhisglance, from thefingertips ofheronehand toher
face, herbodywasnaked butforhismetal bracelet.
“I’m sorry. Hank,” shesaid, “but 1had todoit.”
Hiseyesremained expressionless. Yetshewassuddenly ceitain
thatsheknew what hefelt:hewanted toslapherface.
“Itwasnotnecessary,” heanswered coldly, andwalked on.
* *
Itwasvery latewhen Rearden entered hiswife’s bedroom. She
was stillawake.Alamp burned onherbedside table.
She layinbed,propped uponpillows ofpalegreen linen. Her
bedjacket waspalegreen satin, worn with theuntouched perfection
ofawindow model; itslustrous foldslooked asifthecrinkle oftissue
paper stilllingered among them. The light, shaded toatoneofapple
blossoms, fellonatable thatheld abook, aglass offruit juice, and
toilet accessories ofsilver glittering likeinstruments inasurgeon’s
case.Herarmshad atinge otporcelain. There wasatouch ofpale
pink lipstick onhermouth. Sheshowed nosignofexhaustion after
theparty—nosign otlifetobeexhausted. Theplace w$sadecora-
tor’s display ofaladygroomed forsleep, nottobedisturbed.
He stillwore hisdress clothes; histiewasloose, and!astrand of
hairhung over hisface.Sheglanced athimwithout astonishment,
asifsheknew what thelasthour inhisroom haddonef tohim.
150
Helooked athersilently. Hehadnotentered herroom foralong
lime.Hestood* wishing hehadnotentered itnow.
“Isn't itcustomary totalk, Henry?'”
“Ifyouwish.”
“Iwishyou’d sendoneofyour brilliant experts from themills to
take alook atourfurnace. Doyouknow that itwent outduring the
party andSimons hadaterrible time getting itstarted again? .,.
Mrs.Weston says thatourbestachievement isourcook ---she loved

stand him.”
Hedidnotcare toexplain hispresence, ortodisguise defeat, or
toadmit itbyleaving. Suddenly, itdidnotmatter tohimwhat she
guessed orfelt.Hewalked tothewindow andstood, looking out.
Whyhadshemarried him?—hethought Itwasaquestion hehad
notasked himself ontheirwedding day. eight years ago.Since then,
intortured loneliness, hehadasked itmany times.Hehadfound
noanswer.
Itwasnotforposition, hethought, ortormoney. Shecame from
anoldfamily thathadboth.Her family’s name wasnotamong the
most distinguished and their fortune wasmodest, butbothwere suf-
ficient toletherbeincluded inthetopcircles ofNewYork’s society,
where hehadmet her.Nine years ago.hehadappeared inNew
York likeanexplosion, mtheglare ofthesuccess ofReaiden Steel,
asuccess thathadbeen thought impossible bythecity’s experts. It
was hisindifference thatmade himspectacular. Hedidnotknow
thathewasexpected toattempt tobuyhiswayintosociety andthat
they anticipated thepleasure ofrejecting him.Hehadnotime to
notice their disappointment.
Heattended, reluctantly, afewsocial occasions towhich hewas
invited bymenwhosought hisfavor. Hedidnotknow, butthey
knew, that hiscourteous politeness wascondescension toward the
people whohadexpected tosnub him, thepeople whohadsaid that
theageofachievement was past.
Itwas Lillian’s austerity that attracted him—theconflict between
herausterity andherbehavior. Hehadnever liked anyone orex-
pected tobeliked.Hefound himself held bythespectacle ofa
woman whowasobviously pursuing himbutwithobvious reluctance,
as ifagainst herown will,asiffighting adesire sheresented. Itwas
shewhoplanned thattheyshould meet, then facedhimcoldly* asif
notcaring thatheknew it.Shespoke little; shehadanairofmystery
thatseemed totellhimhewould never break through herproud
detachment, andanairofamusement, mocking herown desire
and his.
Hehadnotknown manywomen. Hehadmoved toward hisgoal,
sweeping aside everything thatdidnotpertain toitintheworld and
inhimself. Hisdedication tohiswork was likeoneofthe fireshe
dealt with, afirethatburned every lesser element, every impurity
outofthewhite stream ofasingle metal.Hewasincapable ofhalf-
wayconcerns. Butthere were timeswhen hefeltasudden access of
151
desire, soviolent that itcould notbegiven toacasual encounter.
Hehadsurrendered toit,onafewrareoccasions through theyears,
withwomen hehadthought heliked.Hehadbeen leftfeeling an
angry emptiness—because hehadsought anactoftriumph, though
hehadnotknown ofwhat nature, buttheresponse hereceived was
onlyawoman's acceptance ofacasual pleasure, andheknew too
clearly thatwhathehadwonhadnomeaning. Hewas left,notwith
asense ofattainment, butwith asense ofhisown degradation. He
grew tohate hisdesire. Hefought it.Hecame tobelieve thedoctrine
that thisdesire waswholly physical, adesire, notofconsciousness,
butofmatter, andherebelled against thethought that hislleshcould
befree tochoose and that itschoice wasimpervious tothewillof
hismind.Hehadspent his life inmines and mills, shaping matter
tohiswishes bythepower ofhisbrain—andhefound itintolerable
thatheshould beunable tocontrol thematter ofhisownbody.He
fought it.Hehadwon hisevery battle against inanimate nature; but
thiswasabattle helost.
Itwasthedifficulty oftheconquest thatmade himwant Lillian.
Sheseemed tobeawoman whoexpected anddeserved apedestal;
thismade himwant todrag herdown tohisbed.Todrag herdown,
were thewords inhismind; theygavehimadark pleasure, thesense
ofavictory worth winning.
Hecould notunderstand why—hethought itwasanobscene con-
flict, thesignofsome secret depravity within him—whyhefelt, at
thesame time, aprofound pride atthethought ofgranting toa
woman the titleofhiswife.The feeling wassolemn andshining; it
wasalmost asifhefeltthathewished tohonor awoman bytheact
ofpossessing her. Lillian seemed tofittheimage hehadnotknown
heheld,hadnotknown hewished tofind;hesawthegrace, the
pride, thepurity; therestwas inhimself; hedidnotknow thathe
waslooking atareflection.
Heremembered thedaywhen Lillian carne fromNewYork tohis
office, ofherownsudden choice, andasked himtotakeherthrough
hismills.Heheard asoft, low, breathless tone— thetone ofadmira-
tion—growing inhervoice, asshequestioned himabout hiswork
andlooked attheplace around her.Helooked athergraceful figure
moving against thebursts offurnace flame, and atthe light swift
steps ofherhigh heels stumbling through drifts ofslag, asshewalked
resolutely byhisside.Thelook inhereyes,when shewatched a
heat ofsteel being poured, was like hisown feeling for itmade
visible tohim.When hereyesmoved uptohisface,hesawthesame
look, butintensified toadegree thatseemed tomake herhelpless
and silent. Itwas atdinner, that evening, thatheasked herto
marry him.
Ittookhimsome time after hismarriage before headmitted to
himself that thiswas torture. He stillremembered theflightwhen
headmitted it,when hetoldhimself—theveins ofhisi^rists pulled
tight ashestood bythebed,looking down atLillian—thathede-
served thetorture andthathewould endure it.Lillian wasnotlook-
ingathim;shewasadjusting her hair.“May Igotosleepnow?"
sheasked.
152
Shehadnever objected; shehadnever refused himanything; she
submitted whenever hewished. Shesubmitted inthemanner ofcom-
plying with therule that itwas, attimes, herduty tobecome an
inanimate object turned over toherhusband’s use.
Shedidnotcensure him.Shemade itclear thatshetook itfor
granted thatmenhaddegrading instincts which constituted these-
cret, ugly partofmarriage. Shewascondescendingly tolerant She
smiled, inamused distaste, attheintensity ofwhat heexperienced.
"Its themost undignified pastime Iknow of,”shesaid tohimonce,
“but 1have never entertained theillusion thatmen aresuperior
toanimals.”
Hisdesire forherhaddied inthe firstweek oftheir marriage.
What remained wasonly aneed which hewasunable todestroy.
Hehadnever entered awhorehouse; hethought, attimes, thatthe
self-loathing hewould experience there could benoworse thanwhat
hefeltwhen hewasdriven toenter hiswife’s bedroom.
Hewould often findherreading abook. Shewould put itaside,
with awhite ribbon tomark thepages. When helayexhausted, his
eyes closed, stillbreathing ingasps, shewould turnonthelight, pick
upthebook andcontinue herreading.
Hetold himself thathedeserved thetorture, because hehad
wished never totouch heragain andwasunable tomaintain his
decision. Hedespised himself forthat. Viedespised aneedwhich
nowheldnoshred ofjoyormeaning, which hadbecome themere
need ofawoman's body, ananonymous body thatbelonged toa
woman whom hehadtoforget while heheld it.Hebecame con-
vinced thattheneedwasdepravity.
Hedidnotcondemn Lillian. He feltadreary, indifferent respect
torherHishatred ofhisown desire hadmade himaccept thedoc-
trine thatwomen werepureandthat apurewoman wasoneincapa-
bleofphysical pleasure.
Through thequiet agony oftheyears ofhismarriage, there had
beenonethought which hewould notpermit himself toconsider:
thethought ofinfidelity. Hehadgiven hisword.Heintended to
keep it.Itwasnotloyalty toLillian: itwasnottheperson ofUilian
thathewished toprotect from dishonor—buttheperson ofhiswife.
Viethought ofthatnow. standing atthewindow. Hehadnot
wanted toenter herroom.Hehadfought against it.Hehadfought,
more fiercely, against knowing theparticular reason whyhewould
notbeable towithstand ittonight. Then, seeing her,hehadknown
suddenly thathewould nottouch her.Thereason which haddriven
himhere tonight wasthereason which made itimpossible torhim.
Hestood still, feeling free ofdesire, feeling thebleak relief of
indifference tohisbody, tothisroom, even tohispresence here.He
hadturned away from her,nottoseeherlacquered chastity. What
hethought heshould feelwasrespect; what hefeltwasrevulsion.
..butDr.Pritchett said thatourculture isdying because our
universities have todepend onthealms ofthemeat packers, the
steel puddlers andthepurveyors ofbreakfast cereals.”
Whyhadshemarried him?—hethought. That bright, crisp voice
wasnottalking atrandom. Sheknewwhyhehadcome here.She
153
knew what itwould dotohimtoseeherpickupasilver buffer and
goontalking gaily, polishing herfingernails. Shewastalking about
theparty. Butshedidnotmention Bertram Scudder—orDagny
Taggart.
What hadshesought inmarrying him?Hefeltthepresence of
some cold, driving purpose within her'—butfound nothing tocon-
demn, Shehadnever tried tousehim.Shemade nodemands onhim.
Shefound nosatisfaction intheprestige ofindustrial power— she
spurned it—shepreferred herown circle offriends. Shewasnot
aftermoney—shespent little—shewas indifferent tothekind of
extravagance hecould have afforded. Hehadnoright toaccuse her,
hethought, orever tobreak thebond. Shewasawoman ofhonor
intheir marriage. Shewanted nothing material from him.
Heturned andlooked atherwearily.
“Next timeyougive aparty." hesaid, “stick toyourowncrowd.
Don’t invite what youthink aremyfriends. Idon’t care tomeet
them socially."
Shelaughed, startled andpleased. “Idon't blame you, darling,"
she said.
Hewalked out,adding nothing else.
What didshewantfromhim?—hethought. What wassheafter?
Intheuniverse asheknew U.there wasnoanswer.
Chapter VIITHEEXPLOITERS ANDTHEEXPLOITED
The rails rosethrough therocks totheoilderricks andtheoilder-
ricks rose tothesky.Dagny stood onthebridge, looking upatthe
crest ofthe hillwhere thesun hitaspotofmetal onthetopofthe
highest rigging. Itlooked like awhite torch lighted over thesnow
ontheridges ofWyatt Oil.
Byspring, shethought, thetrack would meet thelinegrowing
toward itfrom Cheyenne: She lethereyes follow thegreen-blue
rails that started from thederricks, came down, went across the
bridge andpast her.Sheturned herhead tofollow them through
themiles ofdear air,astheywent oningreat curves hungonthe
sides ofthemountains, fartotheendofthenew track, where a
locomotive crane, likeanarmofnaked bones andnerves, moved
tensely against thesky.
Atractor went past her,loaded withgreen -blue bolts.Thesound
ofdrillscame asasteady shudder from farbelow, wheremenswung
onmetal cables, cutting thestraight stone drop ofthecanyon wall
toreinforce theabutments ofthebridge. Down thetrack, shecould
seemenworking, theirarms stiffwith thetension oftheir muscles
astheygripped thehandles ofelectric tietampers.
“Muscles. Miss Taggart," BenNealy, thecontractor, ha$Jsaid to
her,“muscles— that’s ail ittakes tobuild anything inthe4orId."
Nocontractor equal toMcNamara seemed toexistanywhere. She
hadtaken thebestshecould find.Noengineer ontheTaggart staff
could betrusted tosupervise thejob; allofthem were lskeptical
about thenew metal. “Frankly, Miss Taggart," herchiefs engineer
154
hadsaid, "since itisanexperiment thatnobody haseverattempted
before, Idonotthink it'sfairthat itshould bemyresponsibility/’
“lt*smine,” shehadanswered. Hewasaman inhisforties, who
stillpreserved thebreezy manner ofthecollege fromwhich hehad
graduated. Once, Taggart Transcontinental hadhadachief engineer,
asilent, gray-haired, self-educated man,whocould notbematched
onanyrailroad. Hehadresigned, fiveyears ago.
Sheglanced down over thebridge. Shewasstanding onaslender
beam ofsteelabove agorge thathadcracked themountains toa
depth offilteen hundred feet.Far atthebottom, shecould distin-
guish thedimoutlines ofadryriver bed,ofpiled boulders, oftrees
contorted bycenturies. Shewondered whether boulders, treetrunks
andmuscles could ever bridge thatcanyon. Shewondered whyshe
found herself thinking suddenly thatcave-dwellers hadlivednaked
onthebottom ofthatcanyon forages.
Shelooked upattheWyatt oilfields.The trackbroke into sidings
among thewells. Shesawthesmall disks ofswitches dotted against
(hesnow. They were metal switches, ofthekind thatwere scattered
inthousands, unnoticed, throughout thecountry'—butthese were
sparkling inthesunandthesparks were greenish-blue. What they
meant toherwashourupon hour ofspeaking quietly, evenly, pa-
tiently, trying tohitthecenterless target thatwfastheperson ofMr.
Mowen, president oftheAmalgamated Switch andSignal Company,
Inc ,ofConnecticut. “Rut, Miss Taggart, mydearMiss Taggart! My
company hasserved yourcompany forgenerations, why,yourgrand-
father wasthe firstcustomer ofmygrandfather, soyoucannot doubt
ouieagerness todoanything you ask, but—didyousayswitches
made ofRearden Metal?”
“Yes.”
“But, Miss Taggart! Consider what itwould mean, having towork
with that metal.Doyouknow thatthesluftwon’t meltunder less
than fourthousand. degrees? ..Great? Well,maybe that’s great for
motor manufacturers, butwhat I'mthinking ofisthat itmeans a
new type offurnace, anew process entirely, men tol>etrained,
schedules upset, work rules shot, everything balled upandthenGod
onlyknows whether itwillcome outright ornot! . ..Howdoyou

Miss Taggart, agreat many. . . .Well, no, 1can’t saythat itdoes
matter onewayortheother, because whoam Itotake achance on
ajobofthiskind?”
Shehaddoubled theprice ofherorder. Rearden hadsenttwo
metallurgists totrainMowen's men, toteach, toshow, toexplain
every stepoftheprocess, andhadpaid thesalaries ofMowen's men
while theywere being trained.
Shelooked atthespikes inthe rail ather feet.Theymeant the
nightwhen shehadheard thatSummit Casting ofIllinois, theonly
company willing tomake spikes ofRearden Metal, hadgone bank-
rupt, with halfofherorder undelivered. Shehadflown toChicago,
155
that tiight, shehadgotthree lawyers, ajudge andastate legislator
outofbed,shehadbribed twoofthem andthreatened theothers,
shehadobtained apaper thatwasanemergency permit ofalegality
noonewould everbeable tountangle, shehadhadthepadlocked
doors oftheSummit Casting plant unlocked andarandom, half-
dressed crewworking atthesmelters before thewindows hadturned
graywith daylight. Thecrews hadremained atwork, under aTaggart
engineer and aRearden metallurgist. The rebuilding oftheRio
Norte Linewasnotheld up.
Shelistened tothesound ofthe drills.Thework hadbeen held
uponce,when thedrilling forthebridge abutments wasstopped. “I
couldn't help it,Miss Taggart,” BenNealy had said, offended. “You
knowhow fast drillheads wear out. 1hadthemonorder, butIncor-
porated Tool ranintoalittle trouble, they couldn’t help iteither.
Associated Steel wasdelayed indelivering thesteel tothem, so
there’s nothing wecandobutwait. It’snousegetting upset. Miss

“Fve hiredyoutodoajob,nottodoyourbest— -whatever that is.”
“That’s afunny thing tosay.That's anunpopular attitude. Miss
Taggart, mighty unpopular.”
“Forget Incorporated Tool. Forget thesteel.Order the drillheads

“Not me.I’vehadenough trouble with thedamn stuff inthat rail
ofyours.Fmnotgoing tomess upmyownequipment.”
“A drillhead ofRearden Metal willoutlast three ofsteel.”
“Maybe.”
“Isaidorder them made.”
“Who’s going topayforit?”
“Iam.”
“Who’s going tofindsomebody tomake them?”
Shehadtelephoned Rearden. Hehadfound anabandoned tool
plant, long since outofbusiness. Within anhour, hehadpurchased
itfrom therelatives ofitslastowner. Within aday, theplant had
been reopened. Within aweek, drillheads ofRearden Metal had
been delivered tothebridge inColorado.
Shelooked atthebridge. Itrepresented aproblem badly solved,
butshehadhad toaccept it.The bridge, twelve hundred feetof
steel across theblack gap,was built inthedays ofNatTaggart’s
son. Itwaslong past thestage ofsafety; ithadbeen patched with
stringers ofsteel, thenofiron, thenofwood; itwasbarely worth the
patching. Shehadthought ofanewbridge ofRearden Metal. She
hadasked herchief engineer tosubmit adesign andanestimate of
thecost.Thedesign hehadsubmitted wasthescheme ofasteel
bridge badly scaled down tothegreater strength ofthenew metal;
thecostmade theproject impossible toconsider.
“Ibegyourpardon. MissTaggart,” hehadsaid, offended. “Idon’t
know whatyoumeanwhen yousaythat Ihaven’t made Lseofthe
metal. This design isanadaptation ofthebestbridges 4nrecord.
What elsedidyouexpect?”
“Anewmethod ofconstruction.”
“What doyoumean, anewmethod?’
156
“Imean thatwhenmengotstructural steel, theydidnotuse itto
build steel copies ofwooden bridges.” Shehadadded wearily, “Get
meanestimate onwhatwellneed tomake ouroldbridge lastfor
another fiveyears.”
“Yes, Miss Taggart,” hehadsaid cheerfully. “Ifwereinforce it
with steel-*”
“Well reinforce itwithRcarden Metal.”
“Yes, Miss Taggart,” hehadsaid coldly.
Shelooked atthesnow-covered mountains. Herjobhadseemed
hard attimes, inNewYork. Shehadstopped forblankmoments in
themiddle ofheroffice, paralyzed bydespair attherigidity oftime
which shecould notstretch anyfurther—onadaywhen urgent ap-
pointments hadsucceeded oneanother, when shehaddiscussed worn
Diesels, rotting freight cars, failing signal systems, falling revenues,
while thinking ofthelatest emergency ontheRioNorte construction;
when shehadtalked, with thevision oftwostreaks ofgreen-blue
metal cutting across hermind: when shehadinterrupted thediscus-
sions, realizing suddenly whyacertain news itemhaddisturbed her.
andseized thetelephone receiver tocalllong-distance, tocallher
contractor, tosay,“Where doyou gelthefood from, foryour

Sheheard sharp, hurried footsteps andturned.Amanwascoming

Heapproached, stopped, looked atherandsmiled
“Hello, Dagny,” hesaid.
Inasingle shock ofemotion, sheknew everything thetwowords
wereintended totellher. Itwasforgiveness, understanding, acknowl-
edgment, Itwasasalute.
Shelaughed, likeachild, inhappiness that things should beas
right asthat.
“Hello.” shesaid,extending herhand,

Shelooked athim foramoment. “Thanks, Ellis.” shesaid.
Hesmiled andwalked on.Shewatched himashewalked across
thebridge, ashestarted upthelong risetoward hisderricks.
“He thinks heowns theplace, doesn’t he?”
Sheturned, startled. BenNealy hadapproached her: histhumb
waspointing atEllis Wyatt.
“What place?”
“The railroad. Miss Taggart. Your railroad. Orthewhole world
maybe. That's what hethinks.”
BenNealy was abulkymanwith asoft, sullen face. Hiseyeswere
stubborn andblank. Inthebluish light ofthesnow, hisskinhadthe
tinge ofbutter.
“What does hekeep hanging around here lor?” hesaid.“As if
nobody knew their business huthim Ihesnooty show-oft. Whodoes
hethink heis?”
“Goddamn you.” saidDagny evenly, notraising hervoice.
Nealy could' neverknow whathadmade hersay it.Butsome part
ofhim, insomewayofhisown,knew it:theshocking thing toher
wasthathewasnotshocked. Hesaid nothing.
“Let's go,toyour quarters,” shesaid wearily, pointing toanold
railway coach onaspur inthedistance. “Have somebody there to
take notes.”
“Now about those crossties. MissTaggart.” hesaid hastily asthey
started. “MrColeman ofyour office okayed them.Hedidn't say

When shecame outofthecoach, exhausted bytwohours ofeffort
tobepatient, toinstruct, toexplain —shesawanautomobile parked
onthetorn dirtroad below, ablack two-seater, sparkling andnew.
Anew carwasanastonishing sight anywhere; onedidnotsee
them often.
Sheglanced around andgasped atthesight ofthe tallfigure stand-
ingatthefootofthebridge. ItwasHank Rcarden; styehadnot
expected tofindhim inColorado. Heseemed absorbed calcula-
tions, pencil andnotebook inhand. Hisclothes attracted! attention,
like hiscarand forthesame reason; hewore asimple ftrenchcoat
andahatwith aslanting brim, buttheywere ofsuch gtibd quality,
soflagrantly expensive thattheyappeared ostentatious jkmong the
158
seedy garments ofthecrowds everywhere, themore ostentatious
because worn sonaturally.
Shenoticed suddenly thatshewasrunning toward him; shehad
lost alltrace ofexhaustion, 'Fhen sheremembered thatshehadnot

Hesaw her,hewaved toher inagesture ofpleased, astonished
greeting, andhewalked forward tomeet her.Hewassmiling.
'Hello, ”hesaid."Your first triptothejob?”
“My fifth, inthree months.”
"Ididn’t know youwere here.Nobody toldme.”
"Ithought you’d breakdownsome day.”
“Break down?”
"Enough tocome andsee this,There’s your Metal.Howdoyou
like it?”
Heglanced around. ‘Ifyoueverdecide toquittherailroad busi-
ness, letmeknow.”
“You’d givemeajob?”
“Any time.”
Shelooked athimforamoment. “You’re only half-kidding. Hank.
Ithink you’d like ithaving measkyouforajob.Having meforan
employee instead ofacustomer. Giving meorders toobey.”
"Yes. Iwould.”
She said, herface hard, "Don’t quit thesteel business, fwon’t
promise youajobontheraihoad.”
Helaughed. “Don’t trvit.”
“What?”
“Towinanybattle when lsettheterms.”
Shedidnotanswer. Shewasstruck bywhat thewords made her
feel; itwasnotanemotion, butaphysical sensation ofpleasure,
which shecould notname orunderstand.
“Incidentally,” hesaid, “this isnotmy first trip. 1washere
yesterday.”
“You were? Why?”
“Oh, Icame toColorado onsome business ofmyown, so 1
thought I’dlake alook atthis.”
"What arcyouafter?”
“Why doyouassume thatI'mafter anything?”
“You wouldn’t waste timecoming here justtolook.Nottwice.”
Helaughed. "True.” Hepointed atthebridge. "I’m after that.”
“What about it?”
"It'sready forthescrap heap."
“Doyousuppose that Idon’tknow it?”
“Isawthespecifications ofyourorder forRearden Metalmembers

"I’ve thought ofanewRearden Metal bridge. I’vehadmyengi-
neers givemeanestimate.”
"What didthey tellyou?”
159
“Two million dollars.1’
"‘Good God!”
“What would yousay?”
“Eight hundred thousand.”
Shelooked athim.Sheknew thathenever spoke idly.Sheasked,
trying tosound calm,“How?”
“Like this.”
Heshowed herhisnotebook. Shesawthedisjoined notations he
hadmade, agreatmany figures, afewrough sketches. Sheunder-
stood hisscheme before hehadfinished explaining it.Shedidnot
notice thattheyhad satdown, thattheywere sitting onapileof
frozen lumber, thatherlegswere pressed totherough planks and
shecould feelthecoldthrough herthinstockings. They were bent
together over afewscraps ofpaper which couldmake itpossible
forthousands oftons offreight tocross acutofempty space. His
voice sounded sharp and clear, while heexplained thrusts, pulls,
loads, wind pressures. Thebridge wastobeasingle twelve-hundred-
foot-truss span.Hehaddevised anew type oftruss. Ithadnever
beenmade before andcould notbemade except withmembers that
hadthestrength andthelightness otKearden Metal.
“Hank,” sheasked, “didyouinvent this intwodays?”
“Hell. no. 1‘invented’ itlong before IhadReardon Metal. 1fig-
ured itoutwhile making steel forbridges. Iwanted ametal with
which onewould beable todothis,among other things. 1came here
justtoseeyour particular problem formyself.”
Hechuckled, when hesawtheslowmovement ofherhand across
hereyesandthelineofbitterness inthesetofhermouth, asifshe
were trying towipe outthethings against which shehadfought such
anexhausting, .cheerless battle.
“This isonly arough scheme,” hesaid, “but ibelieve yousee
whatcanbedone?”
“Ican’t tellyou allthat 1see,Hank.”
“Don’t bother. Iknow it.”
“You’re saving Taggart Transcontinental forthesecond time.”
“You used tobeabetter psychologist than that.”
“What doyoumean'*”
“Why should 1give adamn about saving Taggart Transcontinen-
tal?Don’t youknow that 1want tohave abridge ofRearden Metal
toshow thecountry?”
“Yes, Hank. 1know it.”
“There aretoomany people yelping that rails ofRearden Metal
areunsafe. So Ithought I’dgivethem something real toyelpabout.
Letthem seeabridge ofRearden Metal.”
Shelooked athimandlaughed aloud insimple delight.
“Now what’s that?” heasked.
“Hank, Idon’tknow anyone, notanyone intheworld, wfio’d think
ofsuchananswer topeople, insuchcircumstances —except you.”
“What about you?Would youwant tomake theanswd withme
andfacethesame screaming?”
“Youknew 1would”
“Yes. Iknew it.”

Heglanced ather, hiseyesnarrowed; hedidnotlaugh asshehad,
huttheglance wasanequivalent.
Sheremembered suddenly their lastmeeting, attheparty* The
memory seemed incredible. Their easewitheach other—thestrange,
light-headed feeling, which included theknowledge that itwasthe
onlysense ofease cither ofthem found anywhere --made thethought
ofhostility impossible. Yetsheknew thattheparty hadtaken place;
hoacted asifithad not.
They walked totheedge ofthecanyon. Together, theylooked at
thedark drop, attheriseofrockbeyond it,atthesunhighonthe
derricks ofWyatt Oil.Shestood, herfeetapartonthefrozen stones,
braced firmly against thewind. Shecould feel,without touching it,
thelineofhischest behind hershoulder. Thewind beathercoat

“Hank, doyouthink wecanbuild itintime? There arconly six

“Sure. Itwilltake lesstimeand labor thananyother type of

“No. Buttheway things aregoing nowadays, youmight notbe

“Idon'tknow . ..”
Helooked atthelinesofthemountains cutacross thesky.Athin
jetofsmoke was rising from adistant valley.
“Have youseen thenewtowns ofColorado andthefactories?”
heasked.
“Yes.”
“It’s great, isn’t it?—toseethekindofmen they’ve gathered here

“What mountain haveyoudecided tomove?”
“Why?”
“What areyoudoing inColorado?”
Hesmiled. “Looking atamining property.”
“What sort?”
“Copper.”
“Good God, don'tyouhaveenough todo?”
“1know it’sacomplicated job.Butthesupply ofcopper isbecom-

“Idon't.” Shewaslooking cast, past themountains. “1think of

“1don’t know.”

“Inever believed that story. Ithought bvthetime thesunwas

“You did?Funny. Ithought that, loo.”
Hepointed atthecolumn ofsmoke. ‘There’s yournew sunrise.
It'sgoing tofeed therest.”
“If it'snotstopped.”
“Doyouthink itcanbestopped?”
Shelooked atthe railunder herfeet.“No,” shesaid.
Hesmiled. Helooked down atthe rail,then lethiseyesmove
along thetrack, upthesides ofthemountains, tothedistant crane.
Shesawtwo things, asif,foramoment, thetwostood alone inher

through space.
“We’ve done it,haven’t we?” hesaid.
Inpayment forevery effort, forevery sleepless night, forevery
silent thrust against despair, thismoment was allshewanted. “Yes.
Wehave.”
Shelooked away, noticed anoldcrane onasiding, andthought
that itscables wereworn andwould need replacing. Thi$wasthe
great clarity ofbeing beyond emotion, after thereward pihaving
felteverything onecould feel.Their achievement, shethought, and
onemoment ofacknowledging it,ofpossessing ittogether—what

Shewondered whatmade hercertain thathefeltas did-He

notlook ateach other.
“Emduetoleave fortheEast inanhour,” hesaid.
Shepointed atthecar.“Where didyougetthat?”
“Here. It'saHammond, Hammond ofColorado—they’re theonly

“Wonderful job.”
“Yes, isn't it?”
“Going todrive itback toNewYork?”
“No, I’mhaving itshipped, 1flewmyplanedown here.”

Hedidnotanswer atonce. .Shenoticed theempty moment ofa

“Oh well, then i’lltrytogetonanairliner, ifIcanfindone

Alonely attendant came tomeet her.“No, Miss Taggart.” he

“Hewasn't flying toNonvYork, washe?”
“Why. yes.Hesaidso”
“Are yousure?”
“He saidhehadanappointment there tonight.”
Shelooked attheskytotheeast, blankly, without moving. She
hadnodue toanyreason, nothing togive herafoothold, nothing
withwhich toweigh thisorlight itorunderstand.

“Damn these streets!” saidJames Taggart. “We’re going tobe
late.”
Dagny glanced ahead, pasttheback ofthechauffeur. Through the
circlemade byawindshield wiper onthesleet^streaked glass, she
sawblack, worn, glistening cartopsstrung inamotionless line.Far
ahead, thesmear ofaredlantern, lowover theground, marked a
street excavation.
“There’s something wrong onevery other street,” saidTaggart
irritably. “Why doesn’t somebody fixthem?”
Sheleaned back against theseat* tightening thecollar ofherwrap.
She feltexhausted attheendofadayshehadstarted atherdesk,m

itsomuch better than 1.It'sveryimportant thatwepresent agood

Sitting beside him inhiscar,sheregretted thatshehadagreed.
Shelooked atthestreets ofNewYork andthought oftherace
between metal andtime, between the rails oftheRioNorte Line
andthepassing days. She feltasifhernerves were being pulled
tightbythestillness ofthecar,bytheguilt ofwasting anevening
when shecould notafford towaste anhour.
“With allthose attacks onRearden thatonehears everywhere,”
saidTaggart, “hemight need afewfriends,”
Sheglanced athimincredulously “Youmean youwant tostand
byhim?”
Hedidnotanswer atonce; heasked, hisvoice bleak. “That report
ofthespecial committee oftheNational Council ofMetal Indus-
tries—whatdoyouthink ofit?”
“Youknow what Ithink ofit.”
“They saidRearden Metal isathreat topublic safety. They said
itschemical composition isunsound, it'sbrittle, it'sdecomposing

anxiously, “You haven’t changed yourmind about it.haveyou?”
“About what?”
“About thatmetal.”
“No, Jim. Ihave notchanged mymind”

Shewatched him. puzzled; thiswasnotlikehim.
Thecarjerked forward. Itmoved slow lythrough agapmaplank

“Ican’t understand it . .saidTaggart miserably. “The topex-

“Who’s thepresident oftheNational Council ofMetal Industries,
Jim?Orren Boyle, isn’t it?”
Taggart didnotturn toher,buthisjawsnapped ope£. “Ifthat

Shelooked upatastreet lamponthecorner. Itwas piglobe of

uDagny, haveyouheard about that discussion atthestructural
steel workers’ union meeting inDetroit?”
“No.What discussion?”
“Itwas inallthenewspapers, lliey debated whether theirmem-
bersshould orshould notbepermitted towork withRearden Metal.
They didn’t reach adecision, butthatwasenough forthecontractor

“Dagny. arewe . . .arewegoing tohave that line built ...

Shelooked athim,bewildered “Why?"
"He refused tosell ustheColorado track ofthePhoenix*

“You didn’t—”Shehad tostop. Shestarted again, keeping her

Heseized herarm, screaming, “Butwhy?”
“You goddamn fool, doyou think Iconsider their question

Thecarstopped, sheleaped outandran.
The firstthing shenoticed after awhile, washerslippers. Shewas
walking slowly, normally, and itwasstrange tofeelicedstone under
thethin soles ofblack satin sandals. Shepushed herhairback, off
herforehead, and feltdrops ofsleet melting onherpalm.
Shewasquiet now; theblinding anger wasgone; she feltnothing
butagray weariness. Herhead ached alittle, sherealized that
shewashungry andremembered thatshewastohavehaddinner
attheBusiness Council. Shewalked on.Shedidnotwant toeat.
Shethought shewould getacupofcoffee somewhere, then takea
cabhome.
Sheglanced around her.There werenocabs insight. Shedidnot
know theneighborhood. Itdidnotseem tobeagood one.Shesaw
anempty stretch ofspace across thestreet, anabandoned park encir-
cledbyajagged line thatbegan asdistant skyscrapers andcame
down tofactory chimneys; shesawafew lights inthewindows of
dilapidated houses, afewsmall, grimy shops closed forthenight,
andthefogoftheEast River twoblocks away.
Shestarted back toward thecenter ofthe city.Theblack shape
ofarumrosebefore her. Ithadbeen anoffice building, long ago;
shesawtheskythrough thenaked steel skeleton andtheangular
remnants olthebricks thathadcrumbled. Intheshadow oftheruin,
like ablade ofgrass fighting tolive attheroots oladead giant,
there stood asmall diner. Itswindows were abright band ofglass
and light. Shewent in
There wasaclean counter inside, with ashining strip ofchromium
attheedges. There wasabnght metal boiler andtheodor ofcoffee.
Afewderelicts satatthecounter, ahusky, elderly man slotKl behind
it,thesleeves ofhisclean white shin rolled attheelbows. Thewarm
airmade her realize, insimple gratitude, thatshehadbeen cold.
Shepulled herblack velvet cape tight about herand satdown at
thecounter.
“Acupofcoffee, please,” shesaid.
Themenlooked atherwithout curiosity. They didnotseem aston-
ished toseeawoman inevening clothes enter aslum diner; nothing
astonished anyone, these days. Flicowner turned impassively tofill
herolder; there was, inhisstolid indifference, thekind ofmerci-
fulness thatasksnoquestions.
Shecould not tellwhether thefour atthecounter were beggars
orworking men; neither clothes normanner showed thedifference,
these days.Theowner placed amug ofcoffee before her.Shedosed
bothhands about it,finding enjoyment initswarmth.
-Sheglanced around herandthought, inhabitual professional cal-
culation, howwonderful itwas thatoneamid buysomuch fora

boiler tothecast-iron griddle, totheglass shelves, totheenameled
sink, tothechromium blades ofamixer. Theowner wasmaking
167
toast: Shefound pleasure inwatching theingenuity ofanopeit belt
thatmoved slowly, carrying slices ofbread pastglowing electric coils.
Then shesawthename stamped onthetoaster: Marsh, Colorado.
Herhead felldown onherarmonthecounter.
“It’snouse, lady,’* said theoldbum beside her.
Shehadtoraise herhead. Shehadtosmile inamusement, athim
and atherself.
“Itisn’t?” sheasked.
“No. Forget it.You're only fooling yourself.”
“About what?”
“About anything being worth adamn. It’sdust, lady, allofit,dust
andblood. Don’t believe thedreams theypump you fullof,andyou
won't gethurt.”
“What dreams?”
“The stories they tellyouwhen you’re young—about thehuman
spirit. There isn’tanyhuman spirit.Man isjustalow-grade animal,
without intellect, without soul, without virtues ormoral values. An
animal withonlytwocapacities: toeatandtoreproduce.”
Hisgaunt face, with staring eyesandshrunken features thathad
been delicate, stillretained atrace ofdistinction. Helooked likethe
hulkofanevangelist oraprofessor ofesthetics whohadspent years
incontemplation inobscure museums. Shewondered whathadde-
stroyed him,what erroronthewaycould bring aman tothis.
“You gothrough lifelooking forbeauty, forgreatness, forsome
sublime achievement,” hesaid. ‘And whatdoyoufind?Alotof

“What’s wrong with inner-spring mattresses?” said amanwho
looked likeatruck driver. ‘Don’t mind him, lady.Helikes tohear

“Man's only talent isanignoble cunning forsatisfying theneeds
ofhisbody,*’ saidtheoldbum.“No intelligence isrequired forthat.
Don’t believe thestories about man’s mind, hisspirit, hisideals, his
sense ofunlimited ambition.”
“1don’t,” saidayoung boywho satattheendofthecounter. He
wore acoat ripped across oneshoulder; hissquare-shaped mouth
seemed formed bythebitterness ofalifetime.
“Spirit?” saidtheoldbum. “There’s nospirit involved inmanufac-

“What ismorality?” sheasked.

Themanwho satintrout ofReurden’s deskhadvague features
and amanner devoid ofallemphasis, sothatonecould farmno
specific image ofhisfacenordetect thedriving motive ofhisperson.
Hisonlymark ofdistinction seemed tobeabulbous nose, abittoo
large fortherestofhim: hismanner wasmeek, but itconveyed a
preposterous hint, thehintofathreat deliberately kept furtive, yet
intended toberecognized. Reardon could notunderstand thepur-
pose ofhisvisit.HewasDr.Pottei. whoholdsome undefined posi-
tionwith theSlate Science Institute.
“What doyouwant?” Rearden asked forthethird time.
“It isthesocial aspect that lamasking youtoconsider, Mr.Rear-
den,” theman said softly. “1urgeyoutotakenote oftheagewe're
living in.Oureconomy isnotready forit.”
“Forwhat?”
“Oureconomy isinastate ofextremely precarious equilibrium,
Wc allhave topoolourefforts tosave itfrom collapse.”
“Well, what isityouwantmetodo?”
“These aretheconsiderations which Iwasasked tocalltoyour

The lightwasgrowing dim inthebroad windows ofthe office.
Thedayswere short. Rearden sawtheirregular shadow ofthenose
ontheman's cheek, andthepaleeyeswatching him; theglance was
vague, but itsdirection purposeful.
“The State Science Institute represents thebestbrains ofthecoun-
try,Mr.Rearden.’'
“SoI’mtold."
“Surety youdonotwant topityourownjudgment against theirs?”
*‘Ido.”
Themanlooked atRearden asifpleading forhelp, asifRearden
hadbroken anunwritten code svhich demanded thatheshould have
understood long ago.Rearden offered nohelp.
“hthis allyouwanted toknow ?”heasked.
“It's only aquestion oftime, Mr.Rearden,” theman said placat-
ingly. “Just atemporary delay. Just togiveoureconomy achance
togetstabilized. Ifyou’d only wait foracouple ofyears—”
Rearden chuckled, gaily, contemptuously. “So that's what you’re
after? WantmetotakeRearden Metal offthemarket? Why?”
“Only forafewyears. Mr.Rearden. Only until—”
“Look,” saidRearden. “Now I'llaskyouaquestion: didyour
scientists decide thatRearden Metal isnotwhat Iclaim itis?”
“Wehave notcommitted ourselves astothat.”
“Did theydecide it’snogood?”
“It isthesocial impact ofaproduct thatmust beconsidered. Wc
arethinking interms ofthecountry asawhole, weareconcerned
with thepublic welfare andtheterrible crisis ofthepresent moment,
which—”
“IsRearden Metal good ornot?”
“Ifweview -thepicture from theangle ofthealarming growth of
unemployment; which atpresent—”
“IsRearden Metal good?”
“Atalimeofdesperate steel shortage, wecannot afford topermit
theexpansion ofasteelcompany which produces toomuch, because
itmight throw outofbusiness thecompanies which produce too
little, thus creating anunbalanced economy which—”
“Are yougoing toanswer myquestion?”
Theman shrugged. “Questions ofvalue arerelative. IfRearden
Metal isnotgood, it'saphysical danger tothepublic. Ifitisgood
it’sasocial danger.”
“Ifyouhave anything tosaytomeabout thephysical danger
ofRearden Metal, say it.Drop therestof it.Fast. Idon't speak
thatlanguage.”
“But surely questions ofsocial welfare—”
“Drop it.”
Themanlooked bewildered and lost, asifthegrounti hadbeen
cutfrom under hisfeet. Inamoment, heasked helplessly, “But
what, then, isyour chief concern?”
“The market.”
“How doyoumean?”
“There’s amarket forRearden Metal and lintend fotake full
advantage ofit.”
170
“Isn’t themarket somewhat hypothetical? Thepublic response to
your metal hasnotbeen encouraging. Except fortheorder from
Taggart Transcontinental, youhaven’t obtained anymajor—”
“Well, then, ifyouthink thepublic won’t gofor it,what areyou
worrying about?”
“Ifthepublic doesn’t gofor it,you willtake aheavy loss,*Mr.
Rearden.”
‘That’s myworry, notyours.”
“Whereas, ifyouadopt amore co-operative attitude andagree to
wait forafewyears—”
“Why should 1wait?”
“But Ibelieve Ihavemade itdear thattheState Science Institute
does notapprove oftheappearance ofRearden Metal onthemetal-
lurgical scene atthepresent time.”
“Why should1give adamn about that?”
Theman sighed. “You areavery difficult man,MrRearden,”
Theskyofthelateafternoon wasgrowing heavy, asifthickening
against theglass ofthewindowpanes. The outlines oftheman's
figure seemed todissolve intoablobamong thesharp, straight planes
ofthefurniture.
“Igaveyou thisappointment,' ”saidRearden, "because youtold
methatyouwished todiscuss something otextreme importance. If
this isallyouhad tosay,you willplease excuse menow. Iam
very busy.*’
Hieman settled back inhischair,Tbelieve youhave spent ten
years ofresearch onRearden Metal.” hesaid.“How* much has it
costyou?”
Rearden glanced up-hecould notunderstand thedriftoftheques-
tion, yettherewasanundisguised purposefulness intheman’s voice;
thevoice hadhardened.
“One andahalfmillion dollars,” saidRearden.
“How much w»Uyoutake forit?”
Rearden hadtoletamoment passHecould notbelieve it.“For
what?” heasked, hisvoice low
“For allrights toRearden Metal“
Tthink youhadbetter getoutothere,” saidRearden.
“there isnocalltorsuchanattitude You areabusinessman, 1am
offering youabusiness proposition. Youmayname yourown price,”
“Hie rights toRearden Mital arenottorsale,”
“1am tnaposition tospeak otlargesums ofmoney. Govern-
mentmoney.”
Rearden satwithout moving, themuscles ofhischeeks pulled tight;
buthisglance wasindifferent, focused onlybythefaint pullofmor-
bidcuriosity.
“You areabusinessman, MrRearden. This isaproposition which
youcannot afford toignore. Ontheonehand, youaregambling
against great odds, youarebucking anunfavorable public opinion,
yourunagood chance oflosing every penny youputintoRearden
Metal.Ontheother hand, wecanrelieve youoftheriskandthe
responsibility; atanimpressive profit, animmediate profit, much
171
larger thanyoucould hope torealize from thesaleofthemetal for
thenexttwenty years/'
“The State Science Institute isascientific establishment, nota
commercial one,” saidRearden. “What isitthat they’re soafraid
of?”
“You areusing ugly, unnecessary words, Mr.Rearden. 1amen-
deavoring tosuggest thatwekeep thediscussion onafriendly plane.
Thematter isserious.”
”1ambeginning toseethat.”
“We areoffering youablank check onwhat is,asyou realize, an
unlimited account. What elsecanyouwant?Name your price.”
“The saleoftherights toRearden Metal isnotopen todiscussion.
Ifyouhave anything else tosay.please say itandleave.”
Themanleaned back, looked atRearden incredulously andasked,
“What areyouafter?”
’i?Whatdoyoumean?”
“You’re mbusiness tomake money, aren’t you?”
“Iam.”
"You want tomake asbigaprofit aspossible, don't you?”
“Ido.”
“Then whydoyouwant tosnuggle toryears, squeezing outyour
gains intheform ofpennies pelton—rather than accept afortune
forRearden Metal? Why?”
“Because it'smine.Doyouunderstand theword’”
Theman sighed androse tohisteet “1hope you willnothave
cause toregret your decision. Mr.Rearden,” hesaid; thetone ofhis
voicewassuggesting theopposite.
“Good day,” saidRearden.
“Ithink 1must tellyouthattheState Science Institute may issue
anofficial statement condemning Rearden Metal.”
“That istheir privilege.”
“Such astatement would make things more difficult foryou.”
“Undoubtedly.”
“Astofurther consequences . ..”Themanshrugged.“This isnot
thedayforpeople who refuse toco-operate. Inthisage,oneneeds
friends. You arenotapopular man, Mr.Rearden.”
“What areyoutiying tosay?”
“Surely, youunderstand.”
“Idon’t.”
“Society isacomplex structure. There arcsomany different issues

“No.”
Theredflame ofpoured steel shotthrough thetwilight. Ajporange
glow, thecolor ofdeep gold, hitthewallbehind Hoarder's desk.
Theglowmoved gently across hisforehead. Hisfacehad atjiunmov-
ingserenity.
“The State Science Institute isagovernment organization* Mr.Re-
arden, There arecertain billspending intheLegislature, which may

Rearden rose tohisfeet.Hewas smiling. Helooked asifall

“No, Dr.Potter,” hesaid, “Idon’t understand. IfIdid. I’dhave

Themanwalked tothedoor, thenstopped andlooked atRearden
inawaywhich, foronce, wassimple human curiosity. Rearden stood
motionless against themoving glowonthewall;hestood casually,
hishands inhispockets.
“Would you tellme,” theman asked, “justbetween us, it’sonly
mypersonal curiosity— why areyoudoing this?”
Rearden answered quietly, “I’ll tellyou.Youwon’t understand.
You see, it’sbecause Rearden Metal isgood.”

Dagny could notunderstand Mr,Mowen’s motive. TheAmalgam-
atedSwitch andSignal Company hadsuddenly given notice thatthey
would notcomplete herorder. Nothing hadhappened, shecould
findnocause for itandtheywould givenoexplanation.
Shehadhurried toConnecticut, toseeMr.Mowen inperson,
butthesole result oftheinterview wasaheavier, grayer weight of
bewilderment inhermind. Mr.Mowen stated thathewould not
continue tomake switches ofRearden Metal. Forsoleexplanation,
hesaid, avoiding hereyes,“Toomany people don’t like it.”
“What? Rearden Metal oryourmaking theswitches?”
“Both, Iguess . . .People don’t like it... 1don’t want any
trouble,”
“What kind oftrouble?”
“Any kind.”
“Have youheard asingle thing against Rearden Metal that’s
true?”
“Aw,whoknows what’s true? ...That resolution oftheNational
Council ofMetal Industries said—”
“Look, you’ve worked with metals allyour life.Forthe lastfour
months, you’ve worked withRearden Metal. Don't youknow that
it’sthegreatest thing you’ve everhandled?” Hedidnotanswer.
“Don’t youknow it?”Helooked away “Don’t youknow what’s
true?”
“Hell. Miss Taggart, I'm inbusiness. I'monly alittle guy.1just
want tomake money.”
“How doyouthinkonemakes it?”
Butsheknew that itwas useless. Dxiking atMr.Mowen sface, at
theeyeswhich shecould notcatch, she feltasshehad feltonceona
lonely section oftrack, when astorm blewdown thetelephone wires
thatcommunications were cutandthatwords hadbecome sounds
which transmitted nothing.
Itwasuseless toargue, shethought, andtowonder about people
whowould neither refute anargument noraccept it.Sitting restlessly
inthetrain, onherwayback toNewYork, shetoldherself thatMr.
Mowen didnotmatter, thatnothing mattered now, except finding
somebody elsetomanufacture theswitches. Shewaswrestling with
173
alistofnames inhermind, wondering whowould beeasiest to
convince, tobegortobribe.
Sheknew, themoment sheentered theanteroom ofheroffice,
thatsomething hadhappened. Shesawtheunnatural stillness, with
thefaces ofherstaffturned toherasifherentrance were themo-
ment theyhad allwaited for,hoped foranddreaded.
Eddie Willers rose tohisfeetandstarted toward thedoor ofher
office, asifknowing thatshewould understand andfollow. Shehad
seen hisface.Nomatter what itwas.shethought, shewished ithad
nothurthimquite sobadly.
"The State Science Institute/' hesaid quietly, when theywere
alone inheroffice,Mhasissued astatement warning people against
theuseofRearden Metal.1
*Headded, “Itwasontheradio. It’sin
theafternoon papers."
“What didtheysay?"
"Dagny, they didn't say it! ,. .Iheyhaven’t really said it,yet it’s
there—and it—isn't. Thai’s what’s monstrous about it."
Hiseffort wasfocused onkeeping hisvoice quiet; hecould not
control hiswords Thewords were forced outofhimbytheunbeliev-
ing.bewildered indignation ofachild screaming indenial athis first
encounter with evil.
"What didthey say,Eddie?"
"They .. .You'd have toread it."Hepointed tothenewspaper
hehad leftonherdesk."They haven't said thatRearden Metal is
bad.They haven't said that it’sunsafe. What they’ve done is . .."
Hishands spread anddropped inagesture offutility.
Shesaw ataglance what theyhaddone. Shesawthesentences;
"Itmaybepossible that after aperiod ofheavy usage, asudden
fissure may appear, though thelength ofthisperiod cannot be
predicted The possibility ofamolecular reaction, atpresent
unknown, cannot beentirely discounted. . . .Although thetensile
strength ofthemetal isobviously demonstrable, certain questions in
regard toitsbehavior under unusual stress arenot toberuled
out. . .'Although there isnoevidence tosupport thecontention
thattheuseofthemetal should beprohibited, afurther study ofits
properties would beofvalue."
"We can’t fight it.Itcan’t beanswered," Eddie wassaying dowly.
"Wccan tdemand aretraction. Wecan'tshowthem our tests or
prove anything. They’ve saidnothing. They haven't saidathing that

Shenodded silently. Shestood, hereyes fixedonsome point be-
yond thewindow. Attheendofadark street, thebulbs ofanelectric
signkeptgoing onand off,asifwinking athermaliciously.
Eddie gathered hisstrength and said inthetone gifamilitary
report, "Taggart slock hascrashed, lienNealy quit. fThe National
Brotherhood ofRoad andTrack Workers hasforbiddeji itsmembers

Shetook herhatandcoat off,walked across theroobi andslowly,
very deliberately satdown atherdesk.

Shenoticed alargebrown envelope lying before her; itbore the
letterhead ofRearden Steel.
“That came byspecial messenger, right afteryou left/’ saidEddie.
Sheputherhandontheenvelope, butdidnotopen it.Sheknew
what itwas: thedrawings ofthebridge.
After awhile, sheasked,“Who issued thatstatement?'’
Eddie glanced atherandsmiled briefly, bitterly, shaking hishead.
“No,” hesaid. “1thought ofthat, too. Icalled theInstitute long-
distance andasked them. No, itwasissued bytheoffice ofDr.Floyd
Ferris, their co-ordinator.”
Shesaidnothing.
“But still! Dr.Stadler isthehead ofthat Institute. HeutheInsti-

She sat,herhand pressed tothebrown envelope.
“Dagny,” heasked, hisvoice low,“what ishappening topeople?
Why didthatstatement succeed? Itssuchanobvious smear-job, so
obvious andsorotten. You’d think adecent person would throw ittit

‘Quiet, Eddie.” shesaid, “quiet. Don’t beafraid.”

Thebuilding oftheState Science institute stood ovet ariver of
NewHampshire, onalonely hillside, halfway between theriverand
thesky.From adistance, itlooked like asolitary monument ina
virgin forest. The treeswere carefully planted, theroads were laid
outasapark, therooftopsofasmalltown could beseen inavalley
some miles away. Butnothing hadbeen allowed tocome toodose
anddetract from thebuilding’s austerity.
Thewhite marble ofthewalls gave itaclassical grandeur: the
composition ofitsrectangular masses gave itthecleanliness and
beauty ofamodern plant, Itwasaninspired structure. From across
theriver, people looked atitwithreverence andthought ofitasa
monument toalivingmanwhose character hadthenobility ofthe
building’s lines. Over theentrance, adedication wascutinto the
marble: “To thefearless mind.Totheinviolate truth,” Inaquiet
aisle, inabare corridor, asmall brass plate, such asdozens ofother
name plates onother doors, said: Dr,Robert Stadler.
Attheageoftwenty-seven. Dr.Robert Stadler hadwritten atrea-
tiseoncosmic rays,which demolished most ofthetheories held
bythescientists whopreceded hint.Those whofollowed, found his
achievement somewhere atthebase ofany lineofinquiry theyun-
dertook. Attheageofthirty, hewasrecognized asthegreatest
physicist ofhistime. Atthirty-two, hebecame head oftheDepart-
ment ofPhysics ofthePatrick Henry University, inthedayswhen
175
thegreat University stilldeserved itsglory. ItwasofDr.Robert
Sfadler thatawriter had said: ‘Perhaps, among thephenomena of
theuniverse which heisstudying, none issomiraculous asthebrain
ofDr.Robert Stadler himself” itwasDr.Robert Stadler whohad
once corrected astudent: “Free scientific inquiry? The firstadjective
isredundant.”
Attheageofforty. Dr.Robert Stadler addressed thenation, en-
dorsing theestablishment ofaState Science Institute. “Set science
freeoftheruleofthedollar,” hepleaded. The issuehadhung in
thebalance; anobscure group ofscientists hadquietly forced abill
through itslongwaytothefloor oftheLegislature; there hadbeen
some public hesitation about the bill,some doubt, anuneasiness no
onecould define. Thename ofDr.Robert Stadler acted upon the
country likethecosmic rayshestudied: itpierced any barrier. The
nation built thewhite marble edifice asapersonal present tooneof
itsgreatest men.
Dr.Stadler’s office attheInstitute wasasmallroom thatlooked
liketheoffice ofthebookkeeper ofanunsuccessful firm.There was
acheap desk ofuglyyellow oak, afiling cabinet, two chairs, anda
blackboard chalked withmathematical formulas. Sitting ononeof
thechairs against ablank wall,Dagny thought that theoffice had
anairofostentation andelegance, together: ostentation, because it
seemed intended tosuggest that theowner wasgreat enough to
permit himself such asetting; elegance, because hetruly needed
nothing else.
ShehadmetDr.Stadler onafewoccasions, atbanquets given by
leading businessmen orgreat engineering societies, inhonor ofsome
solemn cause oranother. Shehadattended theoccasions asreluc-
tantly ashedid,andhadfound thatheliked totalk toher.“Miss
Taggart,” hehad said toheronce, “1never expect toencounter
intelligence. That Ishould find ithere issuchanastonishing relief!”
Shehadcome tohisoffice, remembering that sentence. She sat,
watching him inthemanner ofascientist: assuming nothing, dis-
carding emotion, seeking only toobserve andtounderstand.
“Miss Taggart.” hesaid gaily, “I'm curious about you.I’mcurious
whenever anything upsets aprecedent. Asarule, visitors areapain-
fulduty tome.I’mfrankly astonished that 1should feelsuchasimple
pleasure mseeing you here.Doyouknow what it’slike tofeel
suddenly thatonecantalkwithout thestrain oftrying toforcesome
sortofunderstanding outofavacuum?”
Hesatontheedge ofhisdesk, hismanner gaily informal. Hewas
not tall,and hisslenderness gavehimanairofyouthful energy,
almost ofboyish zest. Histhin facewas ageless; itwasahomely
face, butthegreat forehead andthelarge grayeyes heldsuchan
arresting intelligence thatonea>uld notice nothing else.There were
wrinkles ofhumor inthecorners oftheeyes, and faintdines of
bitterness inthecorners ofthemouth. Hedidnotlook likbaman
inhisearly fifties; theslightly graying hairwas hisonly sig|iofage.
“Tellmemore about yourself,” besaid. “Ialways meai$t toask
youwhat you’re doing insuchanunlikely career asheavy! industry
andhowyoucanstand those people.”
176
“1cannot taketoomuch ofyour time* Dr,Stabler.” Shespoke
with polite, impersonal precision. “And thematter Icame todiscuss
isextremely important.”
Helaughed.“There's asignofthebusinessman —wanting tocome
tothepoint atonce. Well* byallmeans. Butdon’t worry aboutmy
time-—it’s yours. Now, whatwas ityousaidyouwanted todiscuss?
Ohyes.Rearden Metal. Notexactly oneofthesubjects onwhich
I'mbestinformed, but ifthere’s anything Icandoforyou—”His
handmoved inagesture ofinvitation.
“Doyouknow thestatement issued bythisInstitute inregard to
Rearden Metal?”
Hefrowned slightly. “Yes, I’veheard about it.”
“Have youread it?”
“No.”
“Itwasintended toprevent theuseofRearden Metal.”
“Yes, yes, Igathered thatmuch.”
“Could you tellmewhy?”
Hespread hishands: theywere attractive hands— longandbony,
beautiful intheir suggestion ofnervous energy andstrength. “Ireally
wouldn't know. That istheprovince ofDr.Ferris. I’msurehehad
hisreasons. Would you liketospeak toDr.Ferris?”
“No.Areyoufamiliar wirh themetallurgical nature ofRearden
Metal, Dr.Stadler?”
“Why. yes.alittle. But tellme,whyareyouconcerned about it?”
Aflicker ofastonishment roseanddied inhereyes; sheanswered
without change intheimpersonal tone ofhervoice, “Iambuilding
abranch linewith railsofRearden Metal, which—”
“Oh, butofcourse! Ididhearsomething about itYoumust for-
giveme, Idon’t read thenewspapers asregularly as !should. It’s
\our railroad that’s building thatnewbranch, isn’t it?”
“'Hie existence ofmyrailroad depends upon thecompletion of
thatbranch—and. Ithink, eventually, theexistence ofthiscountry
willdepend on itaswell.”
Thewtinkles ofamusement deepened about hiseyes.“Can you
make such astatement with positive assurance. Miss Taggart? I
couldn’t.”
“In thiscase?”
“Inanycase.Nobody can tellwhat thecourse ofacounity’s future
may be. itisnotamatter ofcalculable trends, butachaos subject
totheruleofthemoment, inwhich anything ispossible.”
“Doyouthink thatproduction isnecessary totheexistence ofa
country, Dr.Stadler?”
“Why, yes, yes,ofcourse.”
“Thebuilding ofourbranch linehasbeen stopped bythestate-
ment ofthisInstitute.”
Hedidnotsmile andhedidnotanswer.
“Does thatstatement represent your conclusion about thenature
ofRearden Metal?” sheasked,
“1have saidthat 1have notread it.”There wasanedge ofsharp-
ness inhisvoice.
Sheopened herbag,tookoutanewspaper dipping andextended
177
ittohim.“Would youread itand tellmewhether this isalanguage
which science mayproperly speak?”
Heglanced through theclipping, smiled contemptuously and
tossed itaside withagesture ofdistaste. “Disgusting, isn’t it?”he
said,“Butwhat canyoudowhen youdeal withpeople?”
Shelooked athim, notunderstanding. “You donotapprove of
thatstatement?”
Heshrugged. “My approval ordisapproval would beirrelevant.”
“Have youformed aconclusion ofyourown about Rearden
Metal?”
“Well, metallurgy isnot exactly —what shall wesay?—my
specialty.”
“Have youexamined anydataonRearden Metal?”
“Miss Taggart, 1don’t seethepoint ofyour questions.” Hisvoice
sounded faintly impatient.
“1would liketoknow your personal verdict onRearden Metal."
“Forwhatpurpose?”
“Sothat Imay give ittothepress."
Hegotup,“That isquite impossible.”
Shesaid,hervoice strained withtheeffort oftrying toforce under-
standing, “Iwillsubmit toyou alltheinformation necessary toform
aconclusive judgment.”
“1cannot issue anypublic statements about it.”
“Why not?”
“'lire situation ismuch toocomplex toexplain macasual
discussion.”
“But ifyoushould findthatRearden Metal is,infact,anextremely
valuable product which—”
“That isbeside thepoint.”
"The value ofRearden Metal isbeside thepoint?”
“There areother issues involved, besides questions oliact.”
Sheasked, notquite believing thatshehadheard him right,"What
other issues tsscience concerned with, besides questions offact?”
The bitter lines ofhismouth sharpened into thesuggestion ofa
smite. “Miss Taggart, youdonotunderstand theproblems of.scientists.”
Shesaid slowly, asifshewere seeing itsuddenly intime withher
words, “lbelieve thatyoudoknow whatRearden Metal really is”
Heshrugged. "Yes, lknow. From such information asI'veseen,
itappears tobearemarkable thing. Quite abrilliant achievement—
asfarastechnology isconcerned.” Hewaspacing impatiently across
theoffice. “Infact, Ishould like,some day, toorder aspecial labora-
torymotor thatwould stand justsuch hightemperatures asRearden
Metal cantake. Itwould bevery valuable inconnection witb certain
phenomena 1should liketoobserve. Ihavefound thatwhenl particles
areaccelerated toaspeed approaching thespeed oflight, *ihcy—”
“Dr, Stadler,” sheasked slowly, “youknow thetruth, yetvou will
notstate itpublicly?”
“Miss Taggart, youareusing anabstract term,whenwefaredeal-
ingwithamatter ofpractical reality.”
“Wc aredealing with amatter ofscience”
178
“Science? Aren’t youconfusing thestandards involved? itisonly
intherealm ofpure science thattruth isanabsolute criterion. When
wcdealwithapplied science, withtechnology—wedealwithpeople.
Andwhenwedealwithpeople, considerations other than truth enter
thequestion.”
“What considerations?”
“1amnotatechnologist Miss Taggart. Ihavenotalent ortaste
fordealing withpeople. Icannot become involved inso-called practi-
calmatters.”
“That statement wasissued inyourname.”
“Ihadnothing todowith it!”
“Thename ofthis Institute isyour responsibility.”
“That’s aperfectly unwarranted assumption.”
"People think thatthehonor ofyourname istheguarantee behind
anyaction ofthisInstitute.”
“Ican’t helpwhat people think—ifthey think atall!”
“They accepted your statement Itwasalie.”
“How canonedeal intruthwhen onedeals with thepublic?”
"Idon’t understand you.” shesaidvery quietly.
“Questions oftruthdonotenter into social issues Noprinciples
have everhadanyeffect onsociety.”
“What, then, directs men’s actions?”
Heshrugged. “The expediency ofthemoment.”
“Dr. Sladler,” shesaid, “1think lmust tellyouthemeaning and
theconsequences o!thefactthattheconstruction otmybranch line
isbeing stopped. 1amstopped, inthename otpublic safety, because
1amusing thebest railever produced. Insixmonths, ifldonot
complete that line, thebest industrial section otthecountry willbe
leftwithout transportation Itwillbedestroyed, because itwasthe
bestandthere weremenwhothought aexpedient toseize ashare

“Well, thatmaybevicious, unjust, calamitous —butsuch islifein
society. Somebody isalways sacrificed, asarule unjustly; there isno
otherwav toliveamong men.What cananyoneperson do?”
“You canstate thetruth about Reardon Metal.”
Hedidnotanswer.
“1could begyoutodo itinorder tosaveme. 1could begyouto
do itinorder toavert anational disaster. But 1won’t These may
notbevalid reasons. There isonlyonereason: youmust say it,
because itistrue.”
”1wasnotconsulted about thatstatement!” Thecrybroke out
involuntarily. Twouldn’t have allowed it! Idon't like itanybetter
thanyoudo!But lcan’t issue apublic denial!”
“You were notconsulted? Then shouldn’t youwant tofindout
thereasons behind thatstatement?”
“Ican’t destroy theInstitute now!”
“Shouldn’t youwant tofindoutthereasons?”
“1know thereasons! They won’t tellme,but Iknow.And lcan’t

“Would you tellme?”
“t’H tellyou, ifyouwish, IPsthetruth thatyouwant, isn’t it?Dr.

Ferris cannot help it,ifthemorons who vote thefunds forthis

“Who issupporting younow?" sheasked, hervoice low.

She said, with effort, “You were going totellmethereasons

“Iwouldn’t think you’d findthem hard todeduce. Ifyouconsider

“Don’t go,Miss Taggart. I'dlikeyoutounderstand.”
Sheraised herface tohim, inobedient indifference. Her facewas
notpale, but itsplanes stood outwith strangely naked precision, as
ifitsskinhad losttheshadings ofcolor.

Hewaslooking athersilently, dangling abedroom slipper onthe

inaman's lace, but itdid; itwasmixed with cunning. Sheturned
hereyesaway from him,wondering how itwaspossible thataman's
firstthought insuch amoment could beasearch forsomething to

Then, preposterously, the first thing hesaid, hisvoice anxious,
was,“Butwho willrunTaggart Transcontinental inthemeantime?”
Shechuckled; thesound astonished her. itseemed oldinitsbitter-
ness.She said,“Bddie Wiliers.”
“Ohno1Hecouldn’t!”

Heremained silent, trying tothink, staring down atthefloor.
Sheturned tolook atthegrounds beyond thewindow. Thesky

oftheHudson, shesawtheroad sheused towatch forF'rancisco’s

“Francisco, Iasked youtocome here, because Iwanted youto
seeme inmy office. You’ve never seen it. Itwould ha^emeant
something toyou,once.”
Hiseyesmoved slowly tolook attheoffice. Itswalls vfrere bare,
except forthree things: amapofTaggart Transcont»nental4-the orig-
inaldrawing ofNatTaggart, thathadserved asmodel forhis

186
kind thatwasdistributed each year, with achange ofitspicture, to
every station along theTaggart track, thekind thathadhung once
inher firstwork place atRockdale.
Hegotup.Hesaid quietly, “Dagny, foryour sake,and”—itwas
abarely perceptible hesitation—“and inthename ofany pityyou
might feelforme,don’t request what you’re going torequest. Don't.
Letmegonow.”
Thiswasnot likehimand likenothing shecould everhave ex-

“1can’tanswer you lcan’tanswer anyquestions. That isoneof

“Youknow what Iamgoing torequest?”
“Yes.”Thewayshelooked athimwassuchaneloquent, desperate

“Why?”
Hesmiled mirthlessly, spreading hishands out, as iltoshow her

She said quietly, “1have totry,Francisco, Ihave tomake the

Hespoke, andshelooked athisface inthelamplight, against the

Thedaybegan with thenews ofadisaster: afreight train ofthe
Atlantic Southern hadcrashed head-on intoapassenger train, in
New Mexico, onasharp curve inthemountains, scattering freight
cars allover theslopes. Thecarscarried fivethousand tonsofcopper,
bound from amine inArizona totheRearden mills.
Rearden telephoned thegeneral manager oftheAtlantic Southern,
buttheanswer hereceived was:“OhGod, Mr.Rearden. howcan
wetell?How cananybody tellhowlong itwilltake toclear that
wreck? One oftheworst we’ve everhad... Idon’t know, Mr.
Rearden. There arenoother linesanywhere inthat section. The
track istorn fortwelve hundred feet.There’s been arockslide. Our
wrecking train can’t getthrough. Idon'tknowhow we’ll ever get
those freight carsbackonrails, orwhen. Can’t expect itsooner than
twoweeks . . .Three days? Impossible, Mr.Rearden’ . . .Butwe
can't help it! ...Butsurely youcan tellyourcustomers that it'san
actofGod!What ifyoudoholdthem up?Nobody canblame you
inacase ofthiskind!"
Inthenexttwo hours, with theassistance ofhissecretary, two
young engineers from hisshipping department, aroadmap,andthe
long-distance telephone, Rearden arranged forafleet oftrucks to
proceed tothescene ofthewreck, andforachain ofhopper cars
tomeetthem atthenearest station oftheAtlantic Southern. The
hopper carshadbeenborrowed from Taggart Transcontinental. The
trucks hadbeen recruited from alloverNewMexico, Arizona and
Colorado. Rearden’s engineers hadhunted bytelephone forprivate
truck owners andhadoffered payments thatcut allarguments short.
Itwasdiethird ofthree shipments ofcopper thatRearden had
expected; twoorders hadnotbeen delivered: onecompany hadgone
outofbusiness, theother was stillpleading delays that itcould not
help.
Hehadattended tothematter without breaking hischain ofap-
pointments, without raising hisvoice, without signofstrain, uncer-
tainty orapprehension; hehadacted with theswift precision ofa
military commander under sudden fire—andGwen Ives, hissecre-
tary,hadacted ashiscalmest lieutenant. Shewasagirl inher
latetwenties, whose quietly harmonious, impenetrable facehada
quality matching thebest-designed office equipment; fhcwasone
ofhismost ruthlessly competent employees; hermanner ofper-
forming herduties suggested thekind ofrational cleanliness that
would consider anyclement ofemotion, while atwork. k\sanunpar-
donable immorality.
When theemergency wasover, hersolecomment wa$,“Mr. Rear-

“Wire Fleming inColorado, TellhimI’mtaking anoption onthat

Hewasback athisdesk, speaking lohissuperintendent onone
phone and tohispurchasing manager onanother, checking every

another person thepossibility ofasingle hour’s delay intheflowof
afurnace: itwasthelastofthe railfortheJohn GaltLine thatwas
being poured—when thebuzzer rangandMiss Ives’ voiceannounced
that hismother wasoutside, demanding toseehim.
Hehadasked hisfamily never tocome tothemills without an
appointment. Hehadbeen glad thattheyhated theplace andseldom
appeared inhisoffice. What henow feltwasaviolent impulse to
order hismother offthepremises. Instead, withagreater effort than
theproblem ofthetrainwreck hadrequired othim,hesaid quietly,
“All right.Askhertocome in.”
Hismother came inwithanairofbelligerent defensiveness. She
looked athisoffice asifsheknew what itmeant tohimandasif
shewere declaring herresentment against anything being ofgreater
importance tohimthanherownperson. Shetook alongtime settling
down inanarmchair, arranging andrearranging herbag,hergloves,

“What isit?”
“It’sabout Philip.”
“Yes?”
“Philip isunhappy.”
“Well?”
“He feels it'snot right thatheshould have todepend onyour

Itwasnot inthenature ofhisconsciousness tounderstand the
nature ofthethings hewashearing. Asingle thought cutthrough
hismind likeaspotlight, making himunable toconceive howany
eyescould miss it.Thethought broke outofhimasacryofbewilder-

“What hasthatgottodowith it?Heneeds ajob."

“You hireplenty ofstrangers."
“Ihirernenwhoproduce. What hashegottooffer?"
“He's your brother, isn’the?"
“What hasthatgottodowith it?"
Shestared incredulously, inturn, silenced byshock. Foramoment,
they satlooking ateach other, asifacross aninterplanetary distance.
“He’s your brother," shesaid, hervoice likeaphonograph record

Thewrinkles ofhersoftchin trickled intoashape resembling a

“Why . ..yes,” hesaid softly, astonished atthethought.
“Don’t youever think ofpeople andofyourmoral duties?”

byOrren Boyle's Associated Steel.Hehadwaited forhislastorder
ofsteel forayear.Hehadspent thelastmonth struggling toobtain
apersonal interview withReardcn.
“Iknow thatyour mills arerunning atcapacity. Mr.Rearden,”
hesaid,“and Iknow thatyouarenot inaposition totake careof

“1know. Butwould you justgivemeahearing. Mr.Rearden?”

“They will,” saidRearden.
Thethought oftheJohn Galt Line ranthrough hismind like a
harmony under theconfident sound ofhiswords. TheJohn Galt

stood inempty space, theirwaycleared, free tofinish thejob. nicy’ll
leave usalone todo it.hethought. Thewords were likeabattle
hymn inhismind: lhey’11 leave usalone.
“Our plant capacity isonethousand harvesters peryear,” saidMr.
Ward. “Last year,weputoutthree hundred, tscraped thesteel
together from bankruptcy sales, andbegging afewtonshereand
there from bigcompanies, andjustgoing around likeascavenger to

“Don't waste your timeonthem,” saidReardcn. “You’ll never
getanything from that outfit.”
“You know, Mr.Reardcn,” hesaid inthetone ofadiscovery
which hecould notquite bring himself tobelieve, “lthink there’s
something phony about thewayMr.Boyle runs hisbusiness. Ican’t
understand what he’s after. They’ve gothalf their furnaces idle,but
lastmonth there were allthose bigstones about Associated Steel in

derful housing project thatMr.Boyle’s just built forhisworkers.
Lastweek, itwascolored movies thatMr.Boyle senttoallthehigh
schools, showing how steel ismade andwhat great service itper-
forms toreverybody. Now Mr.Boyle's gotaradio program, they
give talksabout theimportance ofthesteel industry tothecountry
andtheykeep saying thatwemust preserve thesteel industry asa

“1do.Forget it.Hewon’t getaway with it.”
“You know, Mr.Reardcn, 1don't likepeople who talktoomuch

Thewindows oftheoffices oftheJohn GaltLine faced adark
alley. Looking upfrom herdesk.Dagny could notseethesky.only
thewallofabuilding rising pastherrange ofvision.Uwastheside
wallofthegreat skyscraper ofTaggart Transcontinental.
Hernewheadquarters weretworooms ontheground floor ofa
half-collapsed structure. Thestructure stillstood, but itsupper stories
wereboarded offasunsafe foroccupancy. Such tenants asitshel-
tered were half-bankrupt, existing, as itdid,ontheinertia ofthe
momentum ofthepast.
Sheliked hernew place: itsaved money. Therooms contained nt>
superfluous furniture orpeople. The furniture hadcome fromjunk
shops. Thepeople were thebestchoice shecould find.Onherrare
visits toNewYork, shehadnotime tonotice theroom where she
worked; shenoticed only that itserved itspurpose.
Shedidnotknow whatmade herstoptonight andlook atthethin
streaks ofrainontheglass ofthewindow, atthewallofthebuilding
across thealley.
ftwaspastmidnight. Hersmall staffhadgone. Shewasdue at
theairport atthree a.m., toflyherplane back toColorado. Shehad
little lefttodo,only afewofEddie’s reports toread. With the
sudden break ofthetension ofhurrying, shestopped, unable togo
205
on.Thereports seemed torequire aneffort beyond herpower. It
wastoolatetogohome and sleep, tooearly togototheairport.
Shethought: You're tired—andwatched herownmood with severe,
contemptuous detachment, knowing that itwould pass.
Shehadflown toNewYork unexpectedly, atamoment’s notice,
leaping tothecontrols ofherplane within twenty minutes after hear-
ingabrief item inanews broadcast. Theradio voice hadsaid that
Dwight Sanders hadretired from business, suddenly, without reason
orexplanation. Shehadhurried toNew York, hoping tofindhim
andstophim.Butshehad felt,while flying across thecontinent, that
there would benotrace ofhim tofind.
The spring rainhung motionless inthe airbeyond thewindow,
likeathin mist.She sat.looking across attheopen cavern ofthe
Express andBaggage Entrance oftheTaggart Terminal. There were
naked lights inside, among thesteel girders oftheceiling, andalew
piles ofluggage ontheworn concrete ofthefloor.Theplace looked
abandoned anddead.
Sheglanced atajagged crack onthewallofheroffice. Sheheard
nosound. Sheknew shewasalone intheruins ofabuilding. It
seemed asifshewere alone inthe city.She feltanemotion held
back foryears: aloneliness much beyond tinsmoment, beyond the
silence oftheroom andthewet, glistening emptiness ofthestreet:
theloneliness ofagraywasteland where nothing wasworth reaching:
theloneliness ofherchildhood.
Sheroseandwalked tothewindow. Bypressing herlace tothe
pane, shecould seethewhole oftheTaggart Building, itslines con-
verging abruptly toitsdistant pinnacle inthesky.Shelooked upat
thedarkwindow oftheroom thathadbeen heroffice She feltas
ifshewere inexile, never toreturn, asifshewere separated from
thebuilding bymuch more than asheet ofglass, acurtain ofrain
andthespan ofafewmonths.
Shestood, inaroom ofcrumbling plaster, pressed tothewindow-
pane, lookftig upattheunattainable form oleverything sheloved.
Shedidnotknow thenature otherloneliness. Theonlywords that
named itwere: This isnottheworld 1expected.
Once, when shewassixteen, looking atalong stretch ofTaggart
track, attherails thatconverged— likethelines ofaskyscraper —to
asingle point inthedistance, shehad toldEddie Willers thatshe
hadalways feltasiftherailswere held inthehand ofamanbeyond
thehorizon—no,notherfather oranyofthemen intheoffice—
andsome dayshewould meeL him.
Sheshook herheadandturned away from thewindow.
Shewentback toherdesk. Shetried toreach torthereports But
suddenly shewasslumped across thedesk, herhead onherarm.
Don’t, shethought: butshedidnotmove torise, itmad$ nodifter-
encc, there wasnoonetoseeher.
Thiswas alonging shehadnever permitted herself ipacknowl-
edge. Shefaced itnowShethought: Ifemotion isone’s Response to
thethings theworld hastooffer, ifsheloved the rails, thebuilding,
andmore: ifsheloved herlove forthem—there was slillone re-
sponse, thegreatest, thatshehadmissed. Shethought: Tolind a
206
feeling thatwould hold, astheir sum, astheir final expression, the
purpose ofallthethings sheloved onearth ...Tofindaconscious-
ness likeherown,whowould bethemeaning ofherworld, asshe

notanymanshehadevermetoradmired ...Amanwho existed
only inherknowledge ofhercapacity foranemotion shehadnever
felt,butwould have given her lifetoexperience . ..Shetwisted
herself inaslow, faintmovement, herbreasts pressed tothedesk;
she feltthelonging inhermuscles, inthenerves ofherbody.
Isthatwhatyouwant? Isitassimple asthat? shethought, but
knew that itwasnotsimple. There wassome unbreakable linkbe-
tween herlove forherwork andthedesire ofherbody; asifone
gave hertheright totheother, thelightandthemeaning; asifone
were thecompletion oftheother— andthedesire would never be
satisfied, except byabeing ofequal greatness.
Herfacepressed toherarm,shemoved herhead, shaking itslowly
innegation. Shewould never find it.Herownthought ofwhat life
could belike,was allshewould everhave oftheworld shehad
wanted. Only thethought of it—andatewraremoments, likeafew
lights reflected from itonherway-- “toknow, tohold, tofollow to
theend . .,
Sheraised herhead.
Onthepavement ofthealley, outside herwindow, shesaw'the
shadow otamanwhostood atthedoor ofheroffice.
Thedoor wassome steps away; shecould notseehim, orthe
street lightbeyond, only hisshadow onthestones ofthepavement.
Hestood perfectly still.
Hewassodose tothedoor, likeamanabout toenter, thatshe
waited tohearhimknock, instead, shesawtheshadow jerkabruptly,
asifhewere jolted backward, then heturned andwalked away.
There wasonly theoutline ofhishatbrimandshoulders leftonthe
ground, when hestopped. Theshadow lay stillforamoment, wa-
vered, andgrew longer again ashecame back.
She feltnofear.Shesatatherdesk, motionless, watching inblank
wonder. Hestopped atthedoor, thenbacked away from it:hestood
somewhere inthemiddle ofthe alley, thenpaced restlessly and
stopped again. Hisshadow swung likeanirregular pendulum across
thepavement, describing thecourse ofasoundless battle: itwasa
man fighting himself toenter thatdoor ortoescape.
Shelooked on,with peculiar detachment. Shehadnopower to
react, only toobserve. Shewondered numbly, distantly: Whowas
he?Hadhebeen watching herfromsomewhere inthedarkness?
Hadheseen herslumped across herdesk, inthelighted, naked
window? Hadhewatched herdesolate loneliness asshewasnow
watching his?She feltnothing. They were alone inthesilence ofa
dead city—itseemed toherthathewasmiles away, areflection of
suffering without identity, afellow survivor whose problem wasas
distant toherasherswould betohim.Hepaced, moving outof
hersight, coming back again. She sat,watching—ontheglistening
pavement ofadark alley—theshadow ofanunknown torment.
Theshadow moved awayoncemore. Shewaited. Itdidnotreturn.
207
Then sheleaped toherfeet.Shehadwanted toseetheoutcome of
thebattle; now thathehadwonit—orlost—shewasstruck bythe
sudden, urgent need toknow hisidentity andmotive. Sheran
through thedarkanteroom, shethrew thedooropenandlooked out.
The alleywasempty. Thepavement went tapering offintothe
distance, likeaband ofwetmirror under afewspaced lights. There
wasnoone insight. Shesawthedark hole ofabroken window in
anabandoned shop.Beyond it.there were thedoors ofafewroom-
inghouses. Across the alley, streaks ofrain glittered under alight
thathung over theblack gapofanopen door leading down tothe
underground tunnels ofTaggart Transcontinental

Reardon signed thepapers, pushed them across thedeskand
looked away, thinking thathewould never have tothink ofthem
again, wishing hewere carried tothetimewhen thismoment would

ingly helpless. “It’s only alegal technicality. Hank/’ hesaid"You

Rcardcn wondered dimly what itwas thatLarkin wanted from
him.He felt lhat themanwaswaiting torsomething beyond the
physical Iactofthesale,some words which he,Rcardcn. wassup-
posed topronounce, some action pertaining tomercy which hewas
expected togrant. Larkin's eyes, inthismoment ofhisbest tortune,
hadthesickening look otabeggar.
“Why should youbeangrv. Hank? It’sonly anewform oflegal

Larkin looked hurt “That's veiy unfair otyou.” hesaid: there
wasadry little note olrighteous reproach inhisvoice. “Ihavenever
given youcause todistrust me.”Hepicked upthepapers witha
hastymovement.
Rcardcn sawthepapers disappear intoLarkin's inside coatpocket.

Then hesawtheboywhohadbeenHank Reardon ateighteen.
Hesawthetension oftheface, thespeed ofthewalk, thedrunken
exhilaration ofthebody, drunk ontheenergy ofsleepless nights,
theproud liftofthehead, theclear, steady, ruthless eyes, theeyes
ofamanwhodrove himself without pitytoward thatwhich he
wanted. Andhesawwhat PaulLarkin musthavebeen atthattime-
ayouth withanaged baby’s face, smiling ingratiatingly, joylessly,
begging tobespared, pleading with theuniverse togivehim a
chance. Ifsomeone hadshown thatyouth totheHank Rearden of
thattimeandtoldhim that thiswastobethegoal ofhissteps, the
collector oftheenergy ofhisaching tendons, whatwould hehave—
Itwasnotathought, itwas likethepunch ofafistinside hisskull.
Thenwhen hecould think again, Rearden knew what theboyhe
hadbeenwould have felt: adesire tostepontheobscene thing
which wasLarkin andgrind every wet bitof itoutofexistence.
Hehadnever experienced anemotion ofthiskind. Ittookhim a
fewmoments torealize that thiswaswhatmen called hatred.
Henoticed that rising toleave andmuttering some sortofgood-
byes, Larkin hadawounded, reproachful, mouth-pinched look, asif
he,Larkin, were theinjured party.
When hesold hiscoalmines toKenDanagger. whoowned the
largest coalcompany inPennsylvania, Rearden wondered whyhe
feltasifitwere almost painless. He fellnohatred. KenDanagger
wasaman inhis fifties, with ahard, closed face; hehadstarted in
lifeasaminer.
When Rearden handed tohimthedeed tohisnewproperty, Dan-
agger saidimpassively, "Idon't betieve I'vementioned thatanycoal
youbuyfrom me,you’ll get itatcost."
Rearden glanced athim, astonished. "It’s against thelaw," hesaid.
“Who's going tofindoutwhat sortofcash Ihand toyou inyour
own livingroom?"
“You’re talking about arebate."
“fam."
“Thai's against twodozen laws They’ll sockyouworse thanme,
ifthey catch you atit."
“Sure. That's your protection—soyouwon't beleftatthemercy
ofmygood will"
Rearden smiled; itwas ahappy smile, buthedosed hiseyes as
under ablow,Then heshook hishead.“Thanks," hesaid.“But I'm
notoneofthem. Idon’t expect anybody towork formeatcost."
*i’m notoneofthem, either," saidDanagger angrily, “took here,
Rearden, don’t yousuppose 1know what I’mgelling, unearned? The
money doesn’t payyou for it.Notnowadays."
“You didn't volunteer tobidtobuymyproperty. 1asked you to
buy it. Iwish there hadbeensomebody likeyou intheorjcbusiness,
totakeovermymines. There wasn’t. Ifyouwant todotheafavor,
don’t offermerebates. Givemeachance topayyouhigher prices,
higher thananyone else will offer, suckmeanything youwish, just
210
soI’llhefirsttogetthecoal. I’llmanage myendofit.Only letme
have thecoal.”
“You’ll have it.”
Rearden wondered, forawhile, whyheheard noword fromWes-
leyMouch, Hiscalls toWashington remained unanswered. Then he
received aletter consisting ofasingle sentence which informed him
thatMr.Mouch wasresigning from hisemploy. Twoweeks later, he
read inthenewspapers thatWesley Mouch hadbeen appointed As-
sistant Coordinator oftheBureau ofEconomic Planning andNa-
tional Resources.
Don’t dwell onanyof it—thought Rearden, through thesilence
ofmany evenings, fighting thesudden access ofthatnewemotion
which hedidnotwant tofeel--there isanunspeakable evil inthe
woild, youknow it,and it’snousedwelling onthedetails ofit.You
mustwork alittle harder. Just alittle harder. Don’t let itwin.
Thebeams andgirders oftheRearden Metal bridge werecoming
daily outoftherolling mills, andwere being shipped tothesiteof
theJohn Galt Line,where the firstshapes olgreen-blue metal, swung
intospace tospan thecanyon, glittered inthe firstraysofthespring
sun.Hehadnotime forpain, noenergy foranger. Within afew
weeks, itwasover; theblinding stabs ofhatred ceased anddidnot
return.
Hewasbackmconfident self-control ontheevening when he
telephoned Eddie Willers “Eddie. I'minNewYork, attheWayne-
Ealkland Come tohave breakfast withmetomorrow morning.
There’s something I'dliketodiscuss withyou.”
Eddie Willers went totheappointment with aheavy feeling of
guilt.Hehadnotrecovered trom theshock oftheEqualization of
Opportunity Bill; ithad leftadullache within him. liketheblack-
and-blue mark ofablow.Hedisliked thesight ofthecity: itnow
looked asifithidthethreat ofsome malicious unknown. Hedreaded
facing one oftheBill's victims: hefellalmost asifhe,Eddie Willers,
shared theresponsibility for itinsome terrible waywhich hecould
notdefine.
When hesawRearden, thefeeling vanished. There wasnohint
suggesting avictim inReardon’s bearing. Beyond thewindows of
thehotel room, thespring sunlight ofearly morning sparkled onthe
windows ofthecity,theskywasavery paleblue thatseemed young,
theoffices were stillclosed, andthecitydidnotlook asifitheld
malice, butas ifitwere joyously, hopefully ready toswing into ac-
tion- inthesame manner asRearden. Helooked refreshed byan
untroubled sleep, hewore adressing gown, heseemed impatient of
thenecessity todress, unwilling todelay theexciting game ofhis
business duties.
“Good morning. Eddie. Sorry ilIgotyououtsoearly. It’stheonly
time lhad.Have togoback toPhiladelphia right after breakfast. We
captalkwhile we're eating,”
The dressing gown hewore wasofdark blue flannel, with the
white initials“HR”onthebreast pocket. Helooked young, relaxed,
athome inthisroom and intheworld.
Eddie watched awaiter wheel thebreakfast table into theroom
211
withaswift efficiency thatmade him feelbraced. Hefound himself
enjoying the stifffreshness ofthewhite tablecloth andthesunlight
sparkling onthe silver, onthetwobowls ofcrushed iceholding
glasses oforange juice: hehadnotknown thatsuch things could give
himaninvigorating pleasure.

“If 1have theauthority todoit.”
Rearden smiled. “You have”Heleaned forward across thetable.
“Eddie, what’s thefinancial state ofTaggart Transcontinental atthe
moment? Desperate?”
“Worse than that,Mr.Rearden.”
“Arc youable tomeet pay rolls0'*
“Not quite. We've kept itoutotthenewspapers, but Ithink every-
bodyknows it.We’re inarrears allover thesystem andJim isrun-
ningoutofexcuses.’’
“Doyouknow thatyour firstpayment fortheRearden Metal rail

“Yes. Iknow it.”
“Well, let'sagree onamoratorium. I’mgoing togiveyouan
extension—youwon't have topaymeanything until sixmonths alter
theopening oftheJohn Galt Line.”
Eddie Willers putdown hiscup ofcotfeewithasharp thud.He
could notsayaword.
Rearden chuckled. “What's thematter? Youdohave theauthority
toaccept, don't you?”
“Mr.Rearden ... Idon’tknow . ..what tosayto\ou.”
“Why. just ‘.okay’ isallthat’s necessary.”
“Okay, Mr.Rearden.” Eddie’s voice wasbaiely audible
“I’lldrawupthepapers andsendthem toyou.Youcan tellJim

“Yes, Mr.'Rearden.”
“Idon’t like todeal with Jim.He'd waste twohours trying to
make himself believe that he’smademebelieve that he’sdoingme

Eddie satwithout moving, looking down athisplate.
“What’s thematter0”
“Mr. Rearden, I’dlike...tosaythank you .. .butthere isn’t
anyform ofitbigenough to-—”
“Look. Eddie. You've gotthemakings otagood businessman, so

“What?”
“What they’ve done toyou—andwhat you’re doing inreturn. I

“Itwon’t stand.”
Hiesummer sunmade blotches oflireonthewindows ofthecity,
and glittering sparks inthedust ofthe streets. Columns ofheal
shimmered through the air,rising from theroofs tothewhite page
ofthecalendar. Thecalendar's motor ranon,marking offthelast
days ofJune:
“Itwon’t stand,” people said“When theyrunthe first trainon
theJohn Galt Line, the railwill split. They’ll never gettothebridge.
Ifthey do,thebridge willcollapse under theengine,”
From theslopes ofColorado, freight trains roileddown thetrack
ofthePhoenix- Durango, north toWyoming andthemain lineof
Taggart Transcontinental, south toNewMexico andthemain line
oftheAtlantic Southern. Strings oftank carswent radiating inall
directions from theWyatt oilfields toindustries indistant states.No
onespoke about them.Totheknowledge ofthepublic, thetank
trainsmoved assilently asraysand, asrays, theywere noticed only
when theybecame thelightofelectric lamps, theheatoffurnaces,
themovement ofmotors; butassuch, theywere notnoticed, they
were taken forgranted.
ThePhoenix- Durango Railroad wastoendoperations onJuly 25.
“Hanlfr Rearden isagreedy monster,” people said.“Look atthe
fortune he’smade. Hasheever given anything inreturn? Hashe
everknown anysign ofsocial conscience? Money, that’s allhe’s
213
after.Helldoanything formoney. What does hecare ifpeople lose
their liveswhen hisbridge collapses?’*
“The Taggarts have been aband ofvultures forgenerations,”
people said, ‘it’s intheir blood. Justremember thatthefounder of
thatfamily wasNatTaggart, themost notoriously anti-social scoun-
drel thatever lived,whobled thecountry white tosqueeze afortune
forhimself. Youcanbesure thataTaggart won’t hesitate torisk
people’s lives inorder tomake aprofit They bought inferior rail,
because it’scheaper thansteel— whatdothey careabout calastio-
phesandmangled human bodies, after they've collected thefares?”
People said itbecause other people said it.They didnotknow
why itwasbeing saidandheard everywhere. They didnotgiveor
askforreasons, “Reason,” Dr.Pritchett hadtoldthem, “isthemost
naive ofallsuperstitions.”
“The source ofpublic opinion?” saidClaude Slagenhop inaradio
speech. “There isnosource ofpublic opinion. Jtisspontaneously
general. Itisareflex ofthecollective instinct ofthecollective mind.”
Orren Boyle gaveaninterview toGlobe,thenews magazine with
thelargest circulation. Theinterview wasdevoted tothesubject of
thegrave social responsibility ofmetallurgists, stressing thefactthat
metal performed somany crucial taskswhere human livesdepended
onitsquality. “One should not. itseems tome,usehuman beings
asguinea pigs inthelaunching ofanewproduct,” hesaid.Hemen-
tioned nonames.
“Why, no, Idon’t saythat thatbridge willcollapse,” saidthechief
metallurgist ofAssociated Steel, onatelevision program. “Idon't
say itatall. Ijustsaythat if Ihadanychildren. Iwouldn't letthem
rideonthe first train that's going tocross that bridge. But it’sonly
apersonal preference, nothing more, justbecause l*moverly lond
ofchildren.”
“Idon't claim thattheRearden-Taggart contraption willcollapse,”
wrote Bertram Scudder inPieFuture “Maybe itwillandmaybe it
won’t. That’s nottheimportant issue.Theimportant issue is-what
protection does society have against thearrogance, selfishness and
greed oftwounbridled individualists, whose records aieconspicu-
ously devoid ofanypublic-spirited actions? These two, apparently,
arewilling tostake thelives oftheir fellow menontheirowncon-
ceited notions about their powers ofjudgment, against theover-
whelming majority opinion ofrecognized experts. Should society
permit it?Ifthatthing dives collapse, won’t itbetoo latetotake
precautionary measures? Won’t itbelikelocking thebarn after the
horse hasescaped? Ithasalways been thebelief ofthiscolumn that
certain kinds ofhorses should bekept bridled andlocked, ongeneral
social principles.”
Agroup that called itself“Committee ofDisinterested Citizens”
collected signatures onapetition demanding ayear's study ofthe
John Galt Line bygovernment experts before the first train was
allowed torun.The petition staled that itssigners had n|>motive
other than “asense ofcivic duty.” The fir's!signalmen wferc those
ofBalph Tubank andMort Liddy. The petition was givefc agreat
deal ofspace andcomment inallthenewspapers, Tireconsideration
214
itreceived was respectful, because itcame from people whowere
disinterested.
Nospace wasgiven bythenewspapers totheprogress ofthe
construction oftheJohn Galt line.Noreporter wasscat tolook at
thescene. "Hie general policy ofthepress hadbeen stated bya
famous editor fiveyears ago.”'Hiere arenoobjective facts/’ hehad
said, -‘Every report onfacts isonlysomebody’s opinion. Itis,there-
fore, useless towrite about facts.”
Afewbusinessmen thought thatoneshould think about thepossi-
bility thatthere might becommercial value inRearden Metal. They
undertook asurvey ofthequestion. They didnothiremetallurgists
toexamine samples, norengineers tovisit thesiteofconstruction.
They took apublic poll, fenthousand people, guaranteed torepre-
sentevery existing kindofbrain, were asked thequestion. “Would
yourideontheJohn GaltLine?” Theanswer, overwhelmingly, was:
“No, sir-ree!”
Novoices were heard inpublic indefense ofRearden Metal.And
nobody attached significance tothefact that thestock ofTaggart
Transcontinental was rising onthemarket; very slowly, almost fur-
tively. There weremenwhowatched andplayed sate.Mr.Mowen
bought Taggart stock inthename ofhissister. BenNealy bought it
inthename ofacousin. PaulLarkin bought itunder analias.“1
don’t believe inraising controversial issues,” saidoneofthesemen.
“Oh, yes.ofcourse, theconstruction ismoving onschedule,” said
James Taggart, shrugging, tohisBoard ofDirectors “Oh yes,you
may feel fullconfidence. Mydear sister does nothappen tobea
human being, butjustaninternal combustion engine, soonemust
notwonder athersuccess.”
When James Taggart heard arumor thatsome bridge girders had
splitandcrashed, killing threeworkmen, heleaped tohisfeetand
ran tohissecretary’s office, ordering him tocallColorado. He
wailed, pressed against thesecretary’s desk, asifseeking protection:
hiseyeshadtheunfocused look, ofpanic. Vet hismouth moved
suddenly intoalmost asmile andhesaid, “I’d giveanything tosee
Henry Rearden ’sface rightnow.” When heheard thatthemmor
was false, hesaid,“Thank God!” But hisvoice had anote of
disapixnntment.
“Oh well!” said Philip Rearden tohisfriends, hearing thesame
rumor. “Maybe hecan fail, loo.once inawhile. Maybe mygreat
brother isn’t asgreat ashethinks."
“Darling,” said Lillian Rearden toherhusband, “Ifought foryou
yesterday, atateawhere thewomen were saying thatDagny Taggart
isyour mistress. .. .Oh, forheaven’s sake, don’t look atmelike
that! 1know it’spreposterous and Igavethem hellfor it.It’sjust
thatthose sillybitches can’t imagine anyother reason whyawoman
would takesuch astand against everybody forthesake ofyour

oh,butHenry, I’monlyjoking!— <lon’t look atmelikethat!”
“Dagny,” James Taggart saidmiserably, “what’s going tohappen
tous?Taggart Transcontinental hasbecome sounpopular!”
Dagny laughed, menjoyment ofthemoment, anymoment, asif
theundercurrent ofenjoyment wasconstant within herand littlewas
needed totap it.Shelaughed easily, hermouth relaxed andopen.
Herteeth were very white against hersun-scorched face.Hereyes
hadthelook, acquired mopen country, ofbeing setforgreat dis-
tances. Onherlasttew visits toNewYork, hehadnoticed thatshe
looked athimasifshedidnotsechim.
“What arewegoing todo? Thepublic issooverwhelmingly
against us!”
“Jim,doyouremember thestory they tellabout NatTaggart? He
said thatheenvied onlyoneofhiscompetitors, theonewho said
The public bedamned!' Hewished hehadsavd it.”
Inthesummer daysand intheheavy stillness oftheevenings of
thecity, there weremoments when alonely man orwoman—ona
park bench, onastreet corner, atanopenwindow—would seeina
newspaper abriefmention oftheprogress ottheJohn Galt Line,
andwould look atthecitywith asudden stab oflove.They were
theveryyoung, who feltthat itwasthekind ofevent theylonged
toseehappening intheworld— orthevery old,whohadseen a
world inwhich such events didhappen. They didnotcareabout
railroads, they knew' nothing about business, theyknew only that
someone wasfighting against great oddsandwinning. They didnot
admire thefighters’ purpose, theybelieved thevoices ofpublic opin-
ion—and yet,when theyread thattheLinewasgrowing, they felta
moment’s sparkle andwondered why itmade theiiownproblems
seem easier.
Silently unknow ntoeveryone except tothefreight yardofTaggart
Transcontinental inCheyenne andtheoffice oftheJohn GaltLine
inthedark alley freight wasrolling inandorders forcarswere piling
up—forthe first train torunontheJohn Galt Line.Dagny Taggart
hadannounced thatthe first trainwould benotapassengei express
loaded with celebrities and politicians, aswasthecustom, but a
freight special.
"Hie freight came from farms, fromlumber yards, from mines all
over thecountry, from distant places whose lastmeans ofsurvival
were thenew factories ofColorado. Noonewrote about these ship-
pers, because theyweremenwhowere notdisinterested.
ThePhoenix-Durango Railroad wastocloseonJuly 25.The first

“Well, it’slike this.Miss 1aggart.” saidthedelegate oltheUnion
ofLocomotive Engineers. Tdon't thinkweregoing toallow you

Dagny satatherbattered desk, against theblotched wall* ofher
office. She said, without moving, “Get outofhere.”
Itwasasentence themanhadnever heard inthepolished! offices
ofrailroad executives. Helooked bewildered. *icame totellyou—”
“Ifyouhave anything tosaytome, startover again.”
216
“What?”
“Don’t tellmewhat you’re going toallowmetodo.”
“Well, 1meant we’re notgoing toallow ourmen torunyour

“That's different.”
"Well, that’s what we’ve decided.”
“Who’s decided, it?”
“The committee. What you’re doing isaviolation ofhuman rights.
You can’t torcemen togoouttogetkilled—when thatbridge col-

Shesearched forasheet ofblank paper andhanded ittohim.
“Put itdown inwriting,” she said,“and we’ll sign acontract to

“What contract?”
“That nomember otyour union willeverbeemployed torunan

“Why . . .wait aminute ... Ihaven’t said—*’
“You don’t want tosignsuch acontract?”

217
Itwasaquarter ofeleven, onthemorning ofthefifteenth, when
thetelephone rang inheroffice. ItwasEddie, calling from highup
intheTaggart Building outside herwindow. "Dagny, 1think you’d
better come over.’' Hisvoice sounded queer.
Shehurried across the.street, thendown themarble-floored halls,
tothedoor that stillcarried thename"Dagny Taggart” onitsglass
panel. Shepulled thedoor open.
Theanteroom oftheoffice was full.Menstoodjammed among
thedesks, against thewalls.Assheentered, theytook their hats olf
insudden silence. Shesawthegraying heads, themuscular shoulders,
shesawthesmiling faces ofherstaff attheir desks andthefaceof
Eddie Willers attheendoftheroom. Everybody knew thatnothing
hadtobesaid.
Eddie stood bytheopendoor ofheroffice. Thecrowd parted to
letherapproach him.Hemoved hishand, pointing attheroom,
then atapileofletters andtelegrams.
“Dagny. every oneofthem,” hesaid,"Every engineer onTaggart

thattheverdict applied toher,toeveryman intheroom andtothe

“Thank you,” shesaid.
Most ofthemenhadseen hermany times. Looking ather, asshe
raised herhead,many ofthem thought—inastonishment andforthe first

Someone intheback ofthecrowd cried suddenly, cheerfully, "To

Anexplosion answered him.Themenlaughed, theycheered, they
broke intoapplause. Theresponse wasoutofallproportion tothe

They seemed tobeapplauding thespeaker, ininsolent defiance of

Intheclear, monotonous voice ofamilitary report, consulting no
papers, looking straight atthemen,Dagny recited thetechnological
factsabout theJohn Cialf Line, giving exact figures onthenature of
the rail,thecapacity ofthebridge, themethod ofconstruction, the
costs. Then,mthedrvtone ofabanker, sheexplained thefinancial
prospects oftheLineandnamed thelarge profits sheexpected to
make.“Ibat isall,”shesaid.
“AH?” saidoneofthereporters. “Aren’t yougoing togive usa

“

“Rut hell—Imean, aren’t yougoing todefend yourself*”
“Against what?"
“Don’t youwant totellussomething tojustify yourLine?”
“Ihave.”
Aman with amouth shaped asapermanent sneer asked, “Well,
what Iwant toknow, asBertram Scudder stated, iswhat protection
dowehave against your line being nogood?”
“Don’t rideonit.”

Another asked,44Aren’t yougoing totellusyourmotive forbuild*

“1have toldyou; theprofit which 1expect tomake.”
44Oh,Miss Taggart, don’t saythat!” cried ayoung boy.Hewas

Dagny Taggart, without knowing why. “That’s thewrong thing to

“Are they?”

"Oh, haveyounoticed that?” saidRearden.
“Do thetwoofyou realize you're talking forpublication?" asked

“Not really!”

Ownership -she thought, glancing back athim—weren't there
thosewhoknew nothing ofitsnature anddoubted itsreality? No,
itwasnotmade ofpapers, seals, grants andpermissions. There it
was inhiseyes.
Thesound lilling thecabseemed part ofthespace theywere

Things streaked past- -awater tank, atree, ashanty, agrain silo.
Iheyhadawindshield-wiper motion: theywere rising, describing a

thecardiograph record ofasteady heartbeat written across thesky.
Shelooked ahead, attheha/e thatmelted railanddistance, a

sense ofbeing pulled into theunknown bysome unknown power

The glass sheets ofthecab'swindows made thespread ofthe
fieldsseem vaster: theearth looked asopen tomovement asitwas
tosight. Yetnothing wasdistant andnothing wasoutofreach. She
hadbarely grasped thesparkle ofalakeahead— and inthenext

It"was astrange foreshortening between sight and touch, she
thought, between wishand fulfillment, between— thewords clicked

atthecabaround her.The linesteelmesh oftheceiling, shethought,
andtherowofrivets inthecorner, holding sheets ofsteel sealed
together—whomade them? Thebrute force ofmen's muscles? Who
made itpossible forfour dialsandthree levers infront ofPatLogan
tohold theincredible power ofthesixteen motors behind them and
deliver ittotheeffortless control ofoneman's hand?
These things andthecapacity fromwhich theycame— was thisthe

Shelooked outatthecountry. Shehadbeenaware forsome time

since itscompletion, butshehadnothired thehuman chain shesaw
strung outalong theright-of-way. Asolitary figure stood atevery
mile post.Some wereyoung schoolboys, others were sooldthatthe
silhouettes oftheir bodies looked bent against thesky. Allofthem
werearmed, withanything theyhadfound, from costly rifles toan-
cient muskets. Allofthem wore railroad caps.Theywere thesons
ofTaggart employees, andoldrailroad menwhohadretired after a
fulllifetime ofTaggart service. They hadcome, unsummoned, to
guard this train.Astheengine went pasthim,everyman inhisturn
stood erect, atattention, andraised hisgun inamilitary salute.
When shegrasped it,sheburst outlaughing, suddenly, with the
abruptness ofacry.Shelaughed, shaking, likeachild: itsounded

hehadnoted theguard ofhonor long ago.Sheleaned totheopen

Onthecrest ofadistant hill,shesawacrowd ofpeople, their

Ashouses began tocomemore frequently, closer tothetrack, she

sawcrowds blocking theroads atgrade crossings. Theroads went

Theskyhaddeepened tothegteenish-blue ofthe rails,when they

Then shewas sitting intheback seatofanopen ear,driving up

thedriver was Ellis Wyatt.
They stopped atahouse thatstood ontheedge otadill,withno

“Why, olcourse you’re staving atmvhouse overnight, both of

Shelaughed. “Idon’t know. Ihadn’t thought ot itatall.”

“God, no!” shesaid.“Thanks, Ellis.*'
Itwasdarkwhen they satatthedinner table inaroom thathad

“What wereyouexcited about?” asked Dagny, hereyesnarrowed

“Doyoumean, forour firstmeeting?”
“Imean, forour firstmeeting?1
“Don't. Youwere right.’1

“No."

“I’ve always been curious toseewhat you’re like."
‘“I’ve never hadachance tobewhat I’m like—except tonight."
‘“Doyou livehere alone, like this,milesaway from everything?"
Wyatt pointed atthewindow. ‘Tin acouple ofsteps away

“What about people?"
“Ihave guestrooms forthekind ofpeople whocome toseeme

“Hank, whydon’t youmove toColorado? TohellwithNewYork

“Who was itthat saidheneeded afulcrum?" said Ellis Wyatt.
“Give meanunobstructed right-of-wav and I’llshowthemhow to

Shewondered what itwasthatsheliked about thesound ofWy-
att’s laughter. Their voices, even herown,had atone shehadnever
heard before. When they rosefrom thetable, shewasastonished to
notice thatthecandies were theonly illumination oftheroom: she
had fellasifshewere sitting inaviolent light.
EllisWyatL picked uphisglass, looked attheir faces andtsnid, “To
theworld asitseems toberightnow!"
Heemptied theglass with asingle movement.
Sheheard thecrash oftheglass against thewall inthesa^ne instant
thatshesawacircling current—from thecurve ofhisbtjjdy tothe
sweep ofhisarmtotheterrible violence ofhishand thatflung the
glass across theroom. Itwasnottheconventional gesture meant as
234
celebration, itwasthegesture ofarebellious anger, thevicious ges-
turewhich ismovement substituted forascream ofpain,
“Ellis ”shewhispered, “what’s thematter?”
Heturned tolook ather.With thesame violent suddenness* his
eyeswere clear, hisfacewascalm; what frightened herwasseeing
himsmile gently. “I’m sorry,’* hesaid,“Never mind. We’ll tryto
think that itwill last.”
The earth below wasstreaked with moonlight, when Wyatt led
themupanoutside stairway tothesecond floor ofthehouse, tothe
open gallery atthedoors oftheguest rooms. Hewished themgood
night andtheyheard hissteps descending the stairs. Themoonlight
seemed todrain sound as itdrained color. Thesteps rolled intoa
distant past,andwhen they died, thesilence hadthequality ofa
solitude thathad lasted foralong time, asifnoperson were left
anywhere inreach.
Shedidnotturn tothedoor ofherroom. Hedidnotmove. At
thelevel oftheir feet, there wasnothing butathin railing anda
spread ofspace. Angular tiersdescended below, withshadows re-
peating thesteelUaccry otderricks, criss-crossing sharp, black lines
onpatches ofglowing rock.Atew lights, white andred,trembled
intheclear air.likedrops ofraincaught ontheedges ofsteel girders.
Far inthe,distance, three small drops were green, strung inaline
along theTaggart track. Beyond them, aftheendofspace, atthe
footofawhite curve, hung awebbed rectangle which wasthebridge.
She feltarhythm without sound ormovement, asense ofbeating
tension, asifthewheels oftheJohn Galt Linewere stillspeeding
onSlowly, inanswer andmresistance toanunspoken summons,
sheturned andlooked athim.
Thelook shesawonhisfacemade herknow lorthe firsttime
thatshehadknown thiswould betheendofthejourney. That look
wasnotasmen aretaught torepresent it.itwasnotamatter of
loose muscles, hanging lipsandmindless hunger, l’he lines ofhis
facewere pulled tight, giving itapeculiar purity, asharp precision
ofform, making itclean andyoung. Hismouth was taut, the lips
faintly drawn inward, stressing theoutline otitsshape. Only hiseyes
were blurred, their lower lidsswollen andraised, iheir glance intent
with thatwhich resembled hatred andpain.
Theshock became numbness spreading through herbody— she felt
atight pressure inherthroat andherstomach— shewasconscious
ofnothing butasilent convulsion thatmade herunable tobreathe.
Butwhat she felt,without words for it,was:Yes,Hank, yes—now—
because itispart ofthesame battle,msome way that Ican't
name .. .because itisourbeing, against theirs ...ourgreat capacity,
forwhich they torture us,thecapacity ofhappiness . ..Now, like
this,without words orquestions . .because wewant it ...
Itwas likeanactofhatred, likethecutting blow ofalashencir-
cling herbody: she felthisarmsaround her,she feltherlegspulled
forward against himandherchest bentbackunder thepressure of
his,.hismouth onhers.
Herhandmoved from hisshoulders tohiswaist tohislegs, releas-
ingtheunconfessed desire ofherevery meeting withhim.When she
235
tore hermouth away from him, shewaslaughing soundlessly, in
triumph, asifsaying: Hank Rearden—theaustere, unapproachable
Hank Rearden ofthemonklike office, thebusiness confeiences, the
harsh bargains—doyouremember themnow?—I’mthinking ofit,
forthepleasure ofknowing that I’vebrought youtothis.Hewas
notsmiling, hisfacewas tight, itwasthefaceofanenemy, hejerked
herhead andcaught hermouth again, asifhewere inflicting a
wound.
She felthimtrembling andshethought that thiswasthekind of
cryshehadwanted totearfrom him—thissurrender through the
shreds ofhistortured resistance. Yetsheknew, atthesame time,
that thetriumph was his,thatherlaughter washertribute tohim,
thatherdefiance wassubmission, thatthepurpose ofallofhervio-
lentstrength wasonly tomake hisvictory thegreater—hewashold-
ingherbody against his,asifstressing hiswish toletherknow that
shewasnowonly atool forthesatisfaction— ofhisdesire—and his
victory, sheknew, washerwish tolethimreduce hertothat.What-
ever Iam,shethought, whatever pride ofperson Imay hold, the
pride ofmycourage, ofmywork, ofmymind andmyfreedom—
that iswhat Iofferyouforthepleasure ofyour body, that iswhat
Iwantyoutouseinyour service—andthatyouwant ittoserve you
isthegreatest reward Icanhave.
There were lights burning inthetworooms behind them.Hetook
herwristandthrew herinside hisroom, making thegesture tellher
thatheneeded nosignofconsent orresistance. Helocked thedoor,
watching herface.Standing straight, holding hisglance, sheextended
herarm tothelamponthetable andturned outthe light, lieap-
proached- Heturned thelightonagain, with asingle, contemptuous
jerkofhiswrist. Shesawhimsmile forthe firsttime, aslow,mock-
ing,sensual smile thatstressed thepurpose ofhisaction.
Hewasholding herhalf-stretched across thebed,hewastearing
herclothes off,while herfacewaspressed against him, hermouth
moving down thelineofhisneck,down hisshoulder. Sheknew that
every gesture oLher desire forhimstruck him likeablow, thatthere
wassome shudder ofincredulous anger within him—yetthatnogesture
would satisfy hisgreed forevery evidence ofherdesire.
Hestood looking down athernaked body, heleaned over, she
heard hisvoice—itwasmore astatement ofcontemptuous triumph
than aquestion: “You want it‘>”Heranswer wasmore agasp than
aword, hereyes closed, hermouth open: “Yes.”
Sheknew thatwhat she feltwith theskin ofherarmswasthe
cloth ofhisshirt, sheknew thatthelipsshe feltonhermouth were
his,butintherestofherthere wasnodistinction between hisbeing
andherown, asthere wasnodivision between body and spirit.
Through allthesteps oftheyears behind them, thestepsdown a
course chosen inthecourage ofasingle loyalty: their loveofexis-
tence-chosen intheknowledge thatnothing willbegiven, thatone
mustmake one’sown desire andevery shape ofitsfulfilltnent—
through thesteps ofshaping metal, railsandmotors— theyhad
moved bythepower olthethought thatoneremakes theearth for
one’s enjoyment, thatman’s spirit givesmeaning toinsentient matter

themoment when, inanswer tothehighest ofone’s values, inan
admiration nottobeexpressed byanyother form oftribute, one’s
spiritmakes one’s bodybecome thetribute, recasting it—asproof*
assanction, asreward—intoasingle sensation ofsuch intensity of
joythatnoother sanction ofone’s existence isnecessary. Heheard
themoan otherbreath, she felttheshudder ofhisbody, inthe
same instant.
Chapter IXTHESACRED ANDTHEPROFANE
Shelooked attheglowing bands ontheskinofherarm,spaced like
bracelets from herwrist tohershoulder. They were strips ofsunlight
from theVenetian blinds onthewindow ofanunfamiliar room. Shesaw
abruise above herelbow, withdarkbeads thathadbeen blood. Her
arm layontheblanket thatcovered herbody. Shewasaware ofher
legsand hips,buttherestofherbodywasonlyasense oflightness,
asifitwere stretched restfuJly across the airinaplace thatlooked
likeacagemade ofsunrays.
fuming tolook athim,shethought: From hisaloofness, from his
manner ofglass-enclosed formality, from hispride innever being
made tofeelanything—tothis, toHank Rearden inbedbeside her,
after hours ofaviolence which they could notname now, notin
words orindaylight—butwhich was intheir eyes, astheylooked at
each other, which theywanted toname, tostress, tothrow ateach
other's face.
Hesawthefaceofayoung girl,her lipssuggesting asmile, asif
hernatural slate ofrelaxation were astate ofradiance, alqck of
hair tailing across hercheek tothecurve ofanaked shoulder, her
eyeslooking athimasifshewere ready toaccept anything hemight
wish tosay,asshehadbeen ready toaccept anything hehadwished
todo.
Hereached overandmoved thelock ofhairfrom hercheek,
cautiously, asifitwere fragile. Heheld itback with hisfingertips
andlooked atherface.Then hisfingers closed suddenly inherhair
andheraised thelock tohislips.Thewayhepressed hismouth to
itwastenderness, buttheway hisfingers held itwasdespair.
Hedropped backonthepillow and lay still, hiseyes closed. Fits
faceseemed young, atpeace. Seeing itforamoment without the
reins oftension, sherealized suddenly theextent oftheunhappiness
hehadborne; but it'spastnow, shethought, it’sover.
Hegotup,notlooking ather.Hisfacewasblank andclosed again.
Hepicked uphisclothes from thefloorandproceeded todress*
standing inthemiddle oftheroom, half-turned away from her.He
acted, notas ifshewasn’t present, butasifitdidnotmatter that
shewas.Hismovements, ashebuttoned hisshirt, ashebuckled the
beltofhisslacks, hadtherapid precision ofperforming aduty.
She laybackonthepillow, watching him, enjoying thesight of
hisfigure inmotion. Sheliked thegray slacks and shirt—theexpert
mechanic oftheJohn Galt Line, shethought, inthestripes ofsun-
237
lightandshadow, likeaconvict behind bars.Buttheywere notbars
anylonger, theywere thecracks ofawallwhich theJohn GaltLine
hadbroken, theadvance notice ofwhat awaited them outside, be-
yond theVenetian blinds—shethought ofthetripback, onthenew
rail,with the first trainfromWyatt Junction—thetripback toher
offio> intheTaggart Building andtoallthethingsnowopen forher
towin—butshewasfreetolet itwait, shedidnotwant tothink of
it,shewasthinking ofthe firsttouch ofhismouth onhers—shewas
free tofeel it,tohold amoment when nothing elsewasofany
concern—shesmiled defiantly atthestrips ofskybeyond theblinds.
*‘Iwantyoutoknow this.*’
Hestood bythebed, dressed, looking down ather.Hisvoice had
pronounced itevenly, with great clarity andnoinflection. Shelooked
upathimobediently. Hesaid:
“What Ifeel foryou iscontempt. But it’snothing, compared to
thecontempt lteel formyself. Idon’t love you. I’venever loved
anyone, fwanted youfrom the firstmoment Isawyou. Iwanted
youasonewants awhore—forthesame reason andpurpose. 1spent
twoyears damning myself, because Ithought youwere above ade-

beings, youand 1,proud ofourstrength, weren't we?Well, this is
allthat’s leftofus—and 1wantnoself-deception about it.”
Hespoke slowly, asiflashing himself with hiswords. There was
nosound ofemotion inhisvoice, only the lifeless pull ofeffort; it
wasnotthetone ofaman's willingness tospeak, buttheugly, tor-
tured sound ofduty.
“Iheld itasmyhonor that 1would never needanyone 1need

Now ifyouwish toslapmyface*goahead. Iwishyouwoukl*”
Shehad listened, sitting upstraight, holding theblanket clutched
atherthroat tocover herbody. Atfirst,hehadseenhereyesgrow-
ingdark withincredulous shock. Then itseemed tohimthatshewas
listening with greater attentiveness, butseeing more than hisface,
even though hereyeswere fixedonhis.Shelooked asifshewere
studying intently some revelation thathadnever confronted herbe-
fore.He feltasifsome rayoflightwere growing stronger onhis
face,because hesaw itsreflection onhers, asshewatched him—he
sawtheshock vanishing, then thewonder—hesawherfacebeing
smoothed into astrange serenity thatseemed quiet and glittering
atonce.
When hestopped, sheburst outlaughing.
Theshock tohimwasthatheheard noanger inherlaughter. She
laughed simply, easily, injoyous amusement, inrelease, notasone
laughs atthesolution ofaproblem, butatthediscovery thatno
problem hadever existed.
Shethrew theblanket offwith astressed, deliberate sweep ofher
arm.Shestood up.Shesawherclothes onthefloorandkicked them
aside. Shestood facing him, naked. She said:
“1want you.Hank. I’mmuch more ofananimal thanyouthink,

When hethrew herdown onthebed, their bodies met likethe
twosounds thatbroke against each other intheairoftheroom: the
sound ofhistortured moan andofherlaughter.

The rainwas invisible inthedarkness’ ofthestreets, but ithung
likethesparkling fringe ofalampshade under thecorner light.Fum-
bling inhispockets, James Taggart discovered thathehad lost his
handkerchief. Heswore half-aloud, with resentful malice, asifthe

against him.
There wasathingruel ofmudonthepavements; hefeltagluey
suction under hisshoe solesandachill slipping down past hiscollar.
Hedidnotwant towalk ortostop.Hehadnoplace togo.
Leaving hisoffice, after themeeting oftheBoard ofDirectors, he
hadrealized suddenly thatthere were noother appointments, that
hehad alongevening ahead andnoone tohelphim kill it.The
front pages ofthenewspapers were screaming ofthetriumph ofthe
John Galt Line, astheradios hadscreamed ityesterday and all
through the night. Thename ofTaggart Transcontinental was
stretched inheadlines across thecontinent, like itstrack, andhehad
smiled inanswer tothecongratulations. Hehadsmiled, seated at
thehead ofthelong table, attheBoard meeting, while theDirectors
spoke about thesoaring riseoftheTaggart stock ontheExchange,
while they cautiously asked tosee hiswritten agreement with his
sister just incase, they said—andcommented that itwas fine, itwas

realized thathome wastheoneplace where hedared notgotonight.
Hecould notbealone, notinthenext fewhours, yetthere was
nobody tocall.Hedidnotwant toseepeople. Hekept seeing the
eye,softhemenoftheBoard when theyspoke about hisgreatness:
asly,filmy look thatheldcontempt forhimand,more terrifyingly,
forthemselves.
Hewalked, headdown, aneedle ofrain pricking theskinofhis
neckonce inawhile.Helooked awaywhenever hepassed anews-
stand. Thepapers seemed toshriek athimthename oftbeJohn
Galt Line,andanother name which hedidnotwant tohear:vRagnar
Danneskjold. Ashipbound forthePeople's State ofNorway! withan
Emergency Giftcargo ofmachine toolshadbeen seized by|Ragnar
Danneskjold lastnight. That story disturbed him insome personal
manner which hecould notexplain. The feeling seemed -tohave
some quality incommon with thethings hefeltabout theJohn

It’sbecause hehadacold, hethought; hewouldn’t fee! thisway
ifhedidn’t have acold; aman couldn’t beexpected tobeintop
formwhen hehadacold—hecouldn’t help it—what didtheyexpect
himtodotonight, singanddance?— hesnapped thequestion angrily
attheunknown judges ofhisunwitnessed mood- Hefumbled forhis
handkerchief again, cursed anddecided thathe’d better stopsome-
where tobuysome paper tissues.
Across thesquare ofwhat hadoncebeen abusy netghborhr>od,
hesawthelighted windows otadune store, stillopen hopefully at
this latehour. There's another onethat willgooutofbusiness pretty
soon, hethought ashecrossed thesquare; thethought gavehim
pleasure.
There were glaring lights inside, afew tired salesgirls among a
spread otdeserted counters, and thescreaming otaphonograph
record being played foratone, listless customer inacorner. The
music swallowed thesharp edges ofTaggart's voice: heasked for
paper tissues inatonewhich implied thatthesalesgirl wasresponsi-
bletorhiscoldThe girlturned tothecounter behind her,butturned
back once toglance swiftly athisface Shetook apacket, but
stopped, hesitating, studying himwith peculiar curiosity.
“Are youJames Taggart?” sheasked.
“Yes1”hesnapped. ’Why 7”
“Oh!”
Shegasped likeachild ataburst offirecrackers, shewaslooking
athimwith aglance which hehadthought tobereserved only for
movie stars.
Tsawvour picture inthepaper thismorning, Mr.Taggart,” she
sail!very rapidly, afaint flush appearing onherfaceandvanishing.
“Itsaidwhat agreat achievement itwasandhow itwasreally you
whohaddone itail,onlyyoudidn't want ittobeknown.”
“Oh.” saidTaggart. Hewassmiling.
“You look just likeyour picture,” shesaid inimmense astonish-
ment, andadded, “Imagine youwalking inhere like this, inperson!”
“Shouldn’t J?”Histonewasamused.
“1mean, everybody’s talking about it.thewhole country, and
you’re themanwho didit—aridhereyou are* I’venever seenan
important person before. I'venever been soclose toanything impor-
tant, 1mean toanynewspaper news.”
Hehadnever hadtheexperience ofseeing hispresence givecolor
toaplace heentered: the girllooked as itshewasnottired any
longer, as ifthedime store hadbecome ascene ofdrama and
wondeT.
“Mr. laggart. isittrue,what they saidabout you inthepaper7”
“What didtheysay?”
“About your secret.”
“What secret?”
“Weil, they said thatwhen everybody was fighting about your
bridge, whether itwould stand ornot.youdidn't argue withthem,
you ’justwent ahead, because youknew itwould stand, whennobody
elsewassureofit—sotheLinewasaTaggart project andyouwere
241
theguiding spirit behind thescenes, butyoukept itsecret, because
youdidn’t carewhether yougotcredit for itornot.”
Hehadseen themimeographed release ofhisPublic Relations
Department. “Yes,” hesaid, “it’s true.” Thewayshelooked athim
made him feelasifitwere.
“Itwaswonderful ofyou,Mr.Taggart.”
“Doyoualways remember whatyouread inthenewspapers, so
well, insuch detail?”
“Why, yes, Iguess so—alltheinteresting things. Thebigthings. I
liketoreadabout them. Nothing bigeverhappens tome.”
Shesaid itgaily, without self-pity. There wasayoung, determined
brusqueness inhervoice andmovements. Shehadahead ofreddish-
brown curls, wide-set eyes, afewfreckles onthebridge ofanup-
turned nose.Hethought thatonewould callherface attractive if
oneever noticed it,butthere wasnoparticular reason tonotice it.
Itwasacommon little face, except foralook ofalertness, ofeager
interest, alook thatexpected theworld tocontain anexciting secret
behind every corner.
“Mr. Taggart, howdoes itfeeltobeagreatman?”
“How does itfeeltobealittle girl?”
Shelaughed. “Why, wonderful.”
“Then youYe better offthan Iam.”
“Oh,howcanyousaysuch a—”
“Maybe you’re lucky ifyoudon’t have anything todowith the
bigevents inthenewspapers. Big.What doyou call big,anyway?”
“Why ...important.”
“What's important?”
“You’re theonewhoought totellmethat,Mr.Taggart“
“Nothing’s important.”
Shelooked athimincredulously. “You, ofallpeople, saying that
tonight ofallnights!”
“Idon't feelwonderful atall. ifthat’s whatyouwant toknow.
I’ycnever feltlesswonderful inmylife.”
Hewasastonished toseeherstudying hisface with alook of
concern such asnoonehadever granted him“You're worn out.
Mr,Taggart,” shesaid earnestly. “Tell them togotohell.*'
“Whom?”
“Whoever's getting youdown. Itisn't right.”
“What isn't?”
“That youshould feel thisway.You’ve hadatough time, but
you've licked them all,soyouought toenjoy yourself now.You’ve
earned it.”
“Andhowdoyoupropose that Ienjoy myself?”
“Oh, Idon’t know. But lthought you’d behaving acelebration
tonight, aparty with allthebigshots, andchampagne, afrdthings

ofwalking around allbyyourself, shopping forpaper handkerchiefs,

“You givemethose handkerchiefs, before youforget tfcem alto*

242
Sheconsidered itearnestly. “No,*’ shesaid, “Ihadn’t thought of
it.But Icanseewhyyouwouldn’t.”
“Why?” Itwasaquestion towhich hehadnoanswer.
“Nobody’s really good enough foryou, Mr.Taggart,” shean-
swered very simply, notasflattery, butasamatter offact.
“Isthatwhatyouthink?”
“Idon’t think Ilikepeople verymuch, Mr.Taggart. Notmost
ofthem.”
“1don't either. Notanyofthem.”
“Ithought aman likeyou—youwouldn’t knowhowmean they
canbeandhow they trytosteponyouandrideonyour back, if

iromthem andnothave tobeflea-bait allofthetime, butmaybe 1

“What doyoumean, flea-bait?”
“Oh, it’sjustsomething Itellmyself when things gettough—that
I'vegottobeatmywayouttowhere Iwon't feel likeI'm flea-
bitten allthetimebyallkinds oflousiness—butmaybe it’sthesame

“Much bigger.”
Sheremained silent, asifconsidering something, it'stunny,” she
saidsadly tosome thought oiherown.
“What’s tunny?”
“Iread abook once where itsaid that greatmen arealways
unhappy, andthe gieater— theunhappier. Itdidn't make sense to
me.Butmaybe it'strue."
“It’smuch truer thanyouthink"
Shelooked away, herface disturbed.
“Why doyouwortv somuch about thegieatmen?" heasked.
“What areyou, aheroworshipper otsome kind?”
Sheturned tolook athimandhesawthelightofaninner smile,
while herlaceremained solemnly grave, itwasthemost eloquently

Ascreeching sound, neither quite bellnorbuzzer, rangoutsud-

.Shejerked herhead, asifawakening atthescream ofanalarm

regretfully.
“Go getyour hat—I’llwait foryououtside,” hesaid.
Shestared athim, asifamong alloflife's possibilities thiswas

“Nokidding?" shewhispered.
“No kidding."

“Mr. Taggart, what isitthatmakes yousounhappy?”
“Why should youcarewhether Iamornot?”
“Because ...well, ifyouhaven’t theright tobehappy andproud,
whohas?”
“That’s what 1want toknow—who has?” Heturned toher
abruptly, thewords exploding as ifasafety fusehadblown, “He
didn't invent ironoreandblast furnaces, didhe?”
“Who?”
“Rearden. Hedidn't invent smelting andchemistry and aircom-
pression. Hecouldn’t have invented hisMetal butforthousands and
thousands ofother people. HisMetal!Whydoeshethink it’shis?Why
doeshethink it’shisinvention ?Everybody usesthework ofeverybody
else.Nobody ever invents anything.”
She said, puzzled, “But theironoreand allthose other things were
there allthetime.Why didn't anybody elsemake thatMetal, butMr,
Rearden did?”
“He didn't do itforanynoble purpose, hedid itjusttorhisown
profit. He’snever done anything foranyother reason.”
“What’s wrong with that,Mr.Taggart?” Then shelaughed softly,
asifatthesudden solution ofariddle “That’s nonsense, Mr.Tag-
gart.Youdon’tmean it.Youknow thatMr.Rearden hasearned all
hisprofits, andsohave you.You're saying those things just tobe
modest; when everybody knows what agreat jobyoupeople have
done—youandMr.Rearden andyour sister, whomust besuch a

“Yeah? That’s whatyou think. She's ahard, insensitive woman
whospends her lifebuilding tracks and bridges, notloranygreat

great—building that L.ine for allthose prosperous industrialists in
Colorado, when there aresomany poor people inblighted areas
whoneed transportation."
“But, Mr.Taggart, itwasyouwhofought tobuild thatLine,”
“Yes, because itwasmyduty—tothecompany andtheslockhold-
ersandouremployees. Butdon't expect metoenjoy it.I’mnotso
sure itwasgreat—inventing thiscomplex newMetal, when somany
nations are inneed ofplain iron- -why, doyouknow thatthePeo-
ple's State ofChina hasn’t even gotenough nails toputwooden
roofs over people’s heads?”
“But ...but 1don’t seethat that's your fault.”
“Somebody should attend toit.Somebody with thevision tosee
beyond hisownpocketbook. Nosensitive person these days—when
there's somuch suffering around us—would devote tenyears ofhis
lifetosplashing about with alotottrick metals. Youthink it'sgreat?
Well, it'snotanykind ofsuperior ability, butjustahidfe thatyou

There aremany people ofmuch greater ability intheworld, butyou

246
Shewasloojdng athim silently, respectfully, herjoyous eagerness
toned down, hereyessubdued. Hefeltbetter.
Hepicked uphisdrink, took agulp, andchuckled abruptly ata
sudden recollection.
“Itwasfunny, though,” hesaid, histone easier, livelier, thetone
ofaconfidence toapal.“You should haveseenOrren Boyle yester-
day,when the first flashcame through ontheradio from Wyatt

“Who isMr.Boyle?” sheasked, stupefied.
“Oh, afatslob that’s inclined tooverreach himself.Asmart guy

onthegravy trainand , ..well, considering. Thatwasbelter than

oldfool, isgoing around saying thatheknows forcertain thatRear-
dendidn’t invent thatMetal—because hewas told,byanunnamed
reliable source, thatRearden stole theformula from apenniless in-
ventorwhom hemurdered!"
Hewaschuckling happily. Shewas listening astoalecture on
higher mathematics, grasping nothing, noteven thestyle ofthelan-
guage, astyle which made themystery greater, because shewas
certain that itdidnotmean—coming fromhim—what itwould have
meant anywhere else.
He refilled hisglass anddrained it.but hisgaiety vanished
abruptly. Heslumped intoanarmchair, facing her,looking upather
fromunder hisbald forehead, hiseyes blurred.
“She’s coming back tomorrow,” hesaid, withasound likea
chuckle devoid ofamusement.
“Who?”
“My sister.Mydear sister. Oh, she’ll think she’s great, won’t she?”
“You dislike your sister, Mr.Taggart?” Hemade thesame sound;
its,meaning wassoeloquent thatsheneeded noother answer,
“Why?” sheasked.
247
‘‘Because shethinks she's sogood. What right hasshetothink
it?What right hasanybody tothink he'sgood? Nobody's anygood."
“You don'tmean it.Mr,Taggart/’
‘imean, we’re onlyhuman beings—andwhat’s ahuman being?

“But ifamanknows thatwhat he’sdone isgood?"
"Then heought toapologize for it."
"Towhom?"
"Tothosewhohaven’t done it."
"I... Idon’t understand."
"Ofcourse you don’t. Ittakes years andyeais ofstudy inthe

physical Contradictions oftheUniverse, byDr.Simon Pritchett?"
Sheshook herhead, frightened, "How doyouknow what’s good,

Inthebrief space ofhisanswer, she feltfrightened, (sensing a
sudden fearwithin him.Heanswered, “No."
She didn't know whyhervoice dropped toawhispqr. “You'd
rather thebridge hadcollapsed?"
248
“Ihaven't saidthat!” hesnapped sharply. Then heshrugged and
waved hishand inagesture ofcontempt. “You don’t understand.”
*Tm sorry ...Oh, Iknow that Ihave such ariawful lottolearn!”
“Iamtalking about ahunger forsomething much beyond that
bridge.Ahunger thatnothing material willever satisfy.”
“What, Mr.Taggart? What isityouwant?”
“Oh. thereyougo!Themoment youask,‘What isit?’you’re back
inthecrude, material world where everything's gottobetagged and
measured. I’mspeaking ofthings thatcan't benamed inmaterialistic

reach. . . .What's anyhuman achievement, anyway? Theearth is
onlyanatom whiiling intheuniverse —ofwhat importance isthat

Asudden, happy look ofunderstanding cleared hereyes. “It’s
great ofyou,Mr.Taggart, tothink thatyourownachievement isn’t
goodenough foryou. Iguess nomatter how faryouwe gone, you
want togostillfarther. You're ambitious. That's what Iadmire most:
ambition. 1mean, doing things, notstopping andgiving up,but
doing. 1understand, Mr.Taggart . . .even if ldon’t understand all
thebigthoughts.”
“You'll learn.”
“Oh, I'llwork veryhard tolearn!”
Herglance ofadmiration hadnotchanged. Hewalked across the
room, moving inthatglance asinagentle spotlight. Hewent to
refill hisglass.Amirror hung intheniche behind theportable bar.
Hecaught aglimpse ofhisown figure: the tallbody distorted bya
sloppy, sagging posture, asifindeliberate negation ofhuman grace,
thethinning hair, thesoft, sullen mouth itstruck himsuddenly that
shedidnotseehim atall:what shesawwastheheroic figure ofa
builder, with pioudly straight shoulders andwind-blown hair.He
chuckled aloud, feeling that thiswasagood jokeonher. feeling
dimly asatisfaction thatresembled asense ofvictory: thesuperiority
ofhaving putsomething overonher.
Sipping hisdrink, heglanced atthedoor ofhisbedroom and
thought oftheusual ending foranadventure ofthiskind.Hethought
that itwould beeasy: the girlwastooawed toresist.Hesawthe
reddish -bronze sparkle ofherhair— asshe sat,head bent, under a
light—and awedge ofsmooth, glowing skinonhershoulder. He
looked away.Why bother? hethought.
Thehintofdesire thathefeltwasnomore than asense ofphysical
discomfort. Thesharpest impulse inhismind, nagging himtoaction,
wasnotthethought ofthe girl,butofallthemenwhowould not
passupanopportunity ofthiskind.Headmitted tohimself thatshe
wasamuch better person thanBetty Pope, perhaps thebestperson
ever offered tohim.Theadmission lefthim indifferent. He feltno
more thanhehad feltforBetty Pope.He fellnothing. Theprospect
ofexperiencing pleasure wasnotworth theeffort; hehadnodesire
toexperience pleasure.
“It’s getting late,” hesaid.“Where doyoulive?Letmegiveyou
andther drink andthen I’lltakeyouhome.”
When hesaidgood-bye toheratthedoor ofamiserable rooming
249

question which shedesperately wished toaskhim.
“Will 1 ..shebegan, andstopped.
“What?”
“No, nothing, nothing!'’
Heknew thatthequestion was: "Will Iseeyouagain?” itgave
himpleasure nottoanswer, eventhough heknew thatshewould.
Sheglanced upathimonce more, asifitwere perhaps forthe
lasttime, then said earnestly, hervoice low.“Mr. Taggart, I’mvery
grateful to'you. because you... Imean, anyothermanwould have
tried to... 1mean, that’s allhe’d want, butyou’re somuch better
than that, oh,somuch better!”
Heleaned closer toherwithafaint, interested smile. “Would you
have?” heasked.
Shedrew backfrom him, insudden terror atherownwords. “Oh,
Ididn’t meaa itthatway!” shegasped. “OhGod, 1wasn’t hinting
or... or . .Sheblushed furiously, whirled around and ran,
vanishing upthelong, steep stairs oftherooming house.
Hestood onthesidewalk, feeling anodd, heavy, foggy sense of
satisfaction: feeling asifhehadcommitted anactofvirtue— andas
ifhehadtaken hisrevenge upon every person whohadstood cheer-
ingalong thethree-hundred-milc track oftheJohn Galt Line.

When their train reached Philadelphia, Rcarden leftherwithout
aword, asifthenights oftheir return journey deserved noacknowl-
edgment inthedaylight reality ofcrowded station platforms and
moving engines, thereality herespected. ShewentontoNewYork,
alone. Butlatethatevening, thedoorbell ofherapartment rangand
Dagny knew thatshehadexpected it.
Hesaidnothing when heentered, helooked ather,making his
silent presence more intimate agreeting thanwords. There wasthe
faint suggestion ofacontemptuous smile inhisface, atonce admit-
tingandmdeking hisknowledge ofherhours ofimpatience and his
own.Hestood inthemiddle ofher living room, looking slowly
around him; thiswasherapartment, theoneplace inthecitythat
hadbeen thefocus oftwoyears othistorment, astheplace becould
notthink about anddid,theplace hecould notenter—andwasnow
entering with thecasual, unannounced right ofanowner. Hesat
down inanarmchair, stretching hislegsforward—andshestood
before him,almost asifsheneeded hispermission tositdown and
itgave herpleasure towait.
“Shall Itellyou thatyoudidamagnificent job, building that
Line?” heasked. Sheglanced athim inastonishment; hehadnever
paidheropen compliments ofthatkind; theadmiration ifrhisvoice
wasgenuine, butthehintofmockery remained inhisfa^e,andshe
feltasifhewere speaking tosome purpose which shdcould not
guess. “I’ve spent at!dayanswering questions about you-iand about
theLine, theMetal andthefuture. That, andcounting! theorders
fortheMetal. They’re coming inattherateofthousand# oftonsan

anywhere. Today, Ihadtocutoffmyphone, noltolisten toallthe
250
people whowanted tospeak tomepersonally about their urgent
need ofRearden Metal. What didyoudotoday?”
“Idon’t know. Tried tolisten toEddie’s reports—tried toget
awayfrom people—tried tofindtherolling stock toputmore trains
ontheJohn Galt Line, because theschedule I’dplanned won’t be
enough forthebusiness that’s piled upinjustthree days,”
“Agreatmany people wanted toseeyoutoday, didn’t they?”
“Why, yes,”
‘They’d have given anything just foraword with you,wouldn’t
they‘d”
“I... Isuppose so.”
“The reporters keptasking mewhatyouwere like.Ayoung boy
from alocal sheet kept saying thatyouwere agreatwoman. He
saidhe’dbeafraid tospeak toyou, ifheeverhadthechance. He’s
right. That future that they're alltalking andtrembling about—it
willbeasyoumade it,because youhadthecourage none ofthem
could conceive of.Alltheroads towealth that they’re scrambling
fornow, it’syour strength thatbroke them open. The strength to
stand against everyone. The strength torecognize nowillbutyour
own.”
Shecaught thesinking gasp olherbreath, sheknew hispurpose.
Shestood straight, herarms athersides, herface austere, asifin
unflinching endurance: shestood under thepraise asunder alashing
ofinsults.
“They kept asking you questions, too. didn't they?” Hespoke
intently, leaning forward. “And theylooked atyouwith admiration,
theylooked, asityoustood onamountain peakandtheycould only
take their hats offtoyouacross thegreat distance. Didn’t they?”
“Yes.’’ shewhispered.
“They looked asiftheyknew thatonemay notapproach youor
speak inyour presence ortouch afoldofyout dress. Theyknew it
and it'strue.They looked atyouwith respect, didn't they? They
looked uptoyou?”
Heseized heraim, threw herdown onherknees, twisting her
body against hislegs,andbentdown tokisshermouth. Shelaughed
soundlessly, herlaughter mocking, buthereyes half-closed, veiled
with pleasure.
Hours later,when they layinbedtogether, hishandmoving over
herbody, heasked suddenly, throwing herback against thecurve
ofhisarm,bending overher—andsheknew, bytheintensity ofhis
lace,bythesound ofagaspsomewhere inthequality ofhisvoice,

Sheanswered evenly, buthesawadangerous flicker inhereyes,

Thelaughter inhereyesmade itsound likeaslapacross hisface,

Hetwisted herarms behind her,holding herhelpless, herbreasts

through therattle ofthechains which ayoungman inblue overalls
wasfastening over themachinery, securing itto»heflatcars linedon
thesiding oftheQuinn BallBearing Company ofConnecticut.
Mr.Mowen, oftheAmalgamated Switch andSignal Company
across thestreet, stood by,watching. Hehadstopped towatch, on
hiswayhome from hisown plant.Hewore alightovercoat stretched
over hisshort, paunchy figure, andaderby hatover hisgraying,
blondish head. There wasafirsttouch ofSeptember chill inthe air.
Allthegates oftheQuinn plant buildings stood wide iopen, while
menandcranes moved themachinery out; liketaking ;thc vital or-
gansandleaving acarcass, thought Mr.Mowen.
“Another one?” asked Mr,Mowen, jerking histhumb: attheplant,
eventhough heknew theanswer.
“Huh?” asked theyoung man,whohadnotnotice^ himstand-
ingthere.
“Another company moving toColorado?”
252
“Uh-huh”
“It’s thethirdonefrom Connecticut inthelasttwoweeks/' said
Mr.Mowen. “And when youlook atwhat's happening inNew Jer-
sey,Rhode Island, Massachusetts and allalong theAtlantic
coast * .Theyoung manwasnotlooking anddidnotseem to
listen. “It’s likealeaking faucet/’ saidMr.Mowen, “and allthe
water's running outtoColorado. Allthemoney/' Theyoung man
flung thechain across andfollowed itdeftly, climbing over thebig
shape covered with canvas. “You'd think people would havesome
feeling fortheir native state,some loyalty .. .Butthey're running
away. 1don'tknow what’s happening topeople.’’
“It’s theBill,” saidtheyoung man.
“What Bill?"
“The Equalization ofOpportunity Bill’’
“How doyoumean?"
“IhearMr.Quinn wasmaking plans ayearagotoopen abranch
inColorado. The Billknocked thatoutcold.Sonow he'smade up
hismind tomove there, lock, stock andbarrel/’
“1don’t seewhere thatmakes itright.The Billwasnecessary. It's
arotten shame—oldfirms thathavebeen here forgenerations .. .
There ought tobealaw..."
Theyoung manworked swiftly, competently, asifheenjoyed it.
Behind him, theconveyor beltkeptusing andclattering against the
skv.Four distant smokestacks stood like flagpoles, with coils of
smoke weaving slowly about them, likelongbanners athalf-mast in
thereddish glow oftheevening.
Mr.Mowen had lived withevery smokestack ofthatskyline since
thedays ofInsfather andgrandfather. Hehadseen theconveyor
beltfrom hisoffice window forthirty years. That theQumn Ball
Bearing Company should vanish from across thestreet hadseemed
inconceivable; hehadknown about Quinn's decision andhadnot
believed it;orrather, hehadbelieved itashebelieved anywords
heheard orspoke: assounds thatborenofixed relation tophysical
reality. Now heknew that itwas real.Hestood bytheflatcars on
thesiding asifhestillhadachance tostopthem.
“ftisn’t right," hesaid; hewasspeaking totheskyline atlarge,
buttheyoung manabove was theonly partof itthatcould hear
him,“That’s nottheway itwas inmyfather’s time. I’mnotabig
shot. Idon't want tofight anybody. What’s thematter with the
world?" There wasnoanswer. “Now you. forinstance—arethey
taking youalong toColorado?"
“Me? No. Idon't work here I’mjusttransient labor. Justpicked
upthisjobhelping tolugthestuff out,"
“Welt, where areyougoing togowhen theymove away?"
“Haven’t anyidea."
“What arcyougoing todo, ifmore ofthemmove out?"
“Wait andsee."
Mr.Mowen glanced updubiously: hecould not tellwhether the
answer wasintended toapply tohimortotheyoung man.Butthe
youiig man’s attention was fixedonhistask; hewasnotlooking
down.Hemoved ontotheshrouded shapes onthenext flatcar, and
253
Mr.Mowen followed, looking upathim, pleading withsomething
upinspace: ‘Tvc gotrights, haven’t I?1wasborn here. 1expected
theoldcompanies tobeherewhen Igrew up. Iexpected torunthe
plant likemyfather did.Aman ispartofhiscommunity, he’sgot
aright tocount on it,hasn’t he? ...Something ought tobedone
about it.”
“About what?”
“Oh, lknow, youthink it’sgreat, don’t you?—thatTaggart boom
andRearden Metal andthegoldrush toColorado andthedrunken
spree outthere, withWyatt and hisbunch expanding their produc-
tion like kettles boiling over! Everybody thinks it’sgreat—that’s all
youhearanywhere yougo—people areslap-happy, making plans
likesix-year-olds onavacation— you'd think itwasanational honey-
moon ofsome kindorapermanent Fourth olJuly!”
Theyoung man said nothing.
“Weil, 1don’t think so,” saidMr.Mowen. Helowered hisvoice
“The newspapers don't sayso,cither— mind you that—thenewspa-
pers aren’t saying anything.”
Mr.Mowen heard noanswer, only theclanking ofthechains
“Why arethey allrunning toColorado?” heasked. “What have
they gotdown there thatwehaven’t goC”
Theyoung man grinned. “Maybe it'ssomething you've gotthat
they haven’t got.”
‘What?” Theyoung rnan didnotanswer “1don’t see itIt’sa
backward, primitive, unenlightened place. They don't even have a
modern government it'stheworst government inany stale. Ihe
la/iest Itdoes nothing—outside otkeeping lawcourts andapolice
department. Itdoesn't doanything torthepeople Itdoesn't help
anybody. I-don’t seewhy allourbestcompanies want toinnthere.”
Theyoung manglanced down athim, butdidnotanswer
Mr.Mowen sighed. “Things aren’t right,” hesaid.“The Equaliza-
tionofOpportunity Billwasasound idea. There's gottobeachance
foreverybody. It’sarotten shame ifpeople likeQuinn take unfair
advantage o!it.Why didn't heletsomebody else startmanufacturing
ballbearings inColorado? . .Iwish theColorado people would
leave usalone. IhatStockton Foundry outthere hadnoright going

friends, people likeWyatt andDanagger andsuch.Uisn’t fair. It’s
254
discrimination. I'm justasgood asthenext fellow.Vmentitled to
myshare ofthatMetal.”
Theyoung manlooked up,“Iwas inPennsylvania lastweek,” he
said. ”[sawtheReardon mills. There's aplace that's busy! They’re
building fournewopen-hearth furnaces, andthey’ve gotsixmore
coming. .. .New furnaces,” hesaid, looking offtothesouth. ’No-
body's built anew furnace ontheAtlantic Coast forthe last five

motor, looking offatthedusk with afaint smile ofeagerness and
longing, asonelooks atthedistant vision ofone’s love. ’They’re
busy. . .hesaid.
Then hissmile vanished abruptly; thewayhejerked thechain was
thefirstbreak inthesmooth competence ofhismovements: itlooked
like ajoltofanger.
MrMowen looked attheskyline, atthebelts, thewheels, the
smoke -thesmoke thatsettled heavily, peacefully across theevening
air,stretching inalongha/c alltheway tothecityofNewYork
somewhere beyond thesunset— andhefeltreassured bythethought
ofNewYoik initsringofsacred fires, theringofsmokestacks, gas
tanks, cranes andhigh tension lines.He feltacurrent ofpower
flowing through every grirny structure ofhisfamiliar street; heliked
thefigure oftheyoungmanabove him, there wassomething reassur-
ingmthewayheworked, something that blended with the
skyline . .YetMr.Mowen wondeted whyhefeltthatacrack w'as
gmwing somewhere, eating through thesolid, theeternal walls,
‘Something ought tobedone.” saidMr.Mowen. “Afriend of
minewent outofbusiness —lastweek— the oilbusiness -had acou-
pleolwellsdown inOklahoma—couldn’t compete withFlhsWyatt,
hisn’t fair.They ought toleave the little people achance. They

Things aren’t right. Something ought tobedone about it ,.
1ooking attheskyline, Mr.Mowen wondered whatwasthename-
lessthreat to itandwhowas itsdestroyer.
‘‘What doyouwant todoabout it?”asked theyoung man.
“Who, me?” saidMr,Mowen. ”1wouldn’t know. I'mnotabig

‘Owen Kellogg.”
“Listen, Kellogg, whatdoyou think isgoing tohappen tothe

“You wouldn't care toknow.”
Awhistle blewonadistant tower, thenight-shift whistle, andMr.
Mowen realized that itwasgetting late.Hesighed, buttoning his
coat,. turning togo.
“Well, things arebeing done,” hesaid. “Steps arebeing taken.
Constructive steps. TheLegislature haspassed aBillgiving wider
255
powers totheBureau ofEconomic Planning andNational Resources.
They’ve appointed avery ableman asTopCo-ordinator. Can’t say

Dagny stood atthewindow ofherliving room, looking atthecity.
Itwas lateandthelights were likethe lastsparks leftglittering on
theblack remnants ofabonfire.
She feltatpeace, andshewished shecould hold hermind stillto
letherownemotions catch upwith her, tolook ateverymoment
ofthemonth thathadlushed past her.Shehadhadnotime tofeet
thatshewasback inherown office atTaggart Transcontinental;
there hadbeen somuch todothatsheforgot itwasareturn from
exile. Shehadnotnoticed what Jimhad saidonherreturn or
whether hehad said anything. There hadbeen onlyoneperson
whose reaction shehadwanted toknow; shehadtelephoned the
Wayne-Falkland Hotel; butSonorFrancisco d’Anconia, shewas told,
hadgone back toBuenos Aires
Sheremembered themoment when shesigned hername atthe
bottom ofalong legal page: itwasthemoment thatended theJohn
Galt Line.Now itwastheRioNorte LineofTaggart Transcontinen-
talagain—except thatthemen ofthetramcrews refused togiveup
itsname. She. too,lound ithard togive up;sheforced herself not
tocall it“theJohn Galt." andwondered why thatrequired aneffort,
andwhyshe feltafaintwrench ofsadness.
Oneevening, onasudden impulse, shehadturned thecomer ofthe
Taggart Building, forala<4look attheoffice ofJohn Gait. Inc., inthe
alley; shedidnotknow what shewanted- justtosee it,shethought.
Aplank barrier hadbeen raised along thesidewalk: theoldbuilding
wasbeing demolished: ithadgiven up,atlast.Shehadclimbed over
theplanks and.bythelight ofthestreet lamp thathadonce thrown
astranger’s shadow across thepavement, shehadlooked inthrough
thewindow ofherformer office. Nothing was leftoftheground
floor; thepartitions hadbeen torndown, there were broken pipes
hanging from theceiling andapileofrubble ontheHour. There
wasnothing tosee.
Shehadasked Reardon whether hehadcome there onenight Iasi
spring andstood outside herwindow, fighting hisdesire toenter.
Butshehadknown, even before heanswered, thathehadnot.She
didnot tellhimwhysheasked it.Shedidnotknowwhy thatmemory
stilldisturbed herattimes.
Beyond thewindow ofher living room, thelighted rectangle of
thecalendar hung likeasmall shipping tagintheblack $ky. Itread
September 2.Shesmiled defiantly, remembering ther^ee shehad
runagainst itschanging pages: there were nodeadlines now. she
thought, nobarriers, nothreats, nolimits.
Sheheard akeyturningmlhedoor ofherapanmiM; thiswas
thesound shehadwaited for,hadwanted tohear tonigjht.
Rearden came in,ashehadcomemany times, using (hekeyshe
hadgiven him, assoleannouncement. Hethrew hishatandcoal
256
down onachair with agesture thathadbecome familiar; hewore
theformal black ofdinner clothes.
“Hello,” shesaid.
‘Tm stillwaiting fortheevening when lwon’t lindyou in,”he
answered.
“Then you'll have tophone theoffices ofIaggart Transcontinental.”
“Any evening? Nowhere else?”
“Jealous, Hank?”
“No. Curious what itwould feel like, tobe.”
Hestood looking atheracross theroom, refusing tolethimself
approach her,deliberately prolonging thepleasure ofknowing that
hecould do itwhenever hewished. Shewore thetight gray skirt of
anoffice suitandablouse oftransparent white cloth tailored likea
man’s shirt: theblouse flared outabove herwaistline, stressing the
trim flatness ofherhips: against theglow ofalamp behind her,he
could seetheslender silhouette ofherbody within theflaring circle
oftheblouse.
“How wasthebanquet?” sheasked.
“Fine. 1escaped assoon as Icould.Why didn’t youcome? You
were invited.”
“1didn’t want toseeyou inpublic”
Heglanced ather, asifstressing thathenoted the fullmeaning
ofheranswer; then thelines ofhisfacemoved tothehint ofan
amused smile. “You missed alot.TheNational Council ofMetal
Industries won’t put itself again through theordeal ofhaving mefor
guest ofhonor. Not iftheycanhelp it”
“What happened?”
“Nothing. Just alotofspeeches.”
“W'as itanordeal foryou?”
“No...Yes, inaway... Ihad really wanted toenjoy it.”
“Shall Igetyouadunk?”
“Yes, willyou?”
Sheturned togo.Hestopped her,grasping hershoulders from
behind; hebentherheadbackandkissed hermouth When heraised
hishead, shepulled itdown again with ademanding gesture of
ownership, as itstressing herright todoitThen shestepped away
from him.
“Never mind thedrink,” hesaid. “1didn't really want it—except
torseeing youwaitonme.”
“Well, then, letmewaitonyou.”
“No.”
Hesmiled, stretching himself outonthecouch, hishands crossed
under hishead.Hefeltathome: itwasthe firsthome hehadever
tound.
“You know, theworst part otthebanquet wasthattheonlywish
ofevery person present wastoget itover with*” hesaid,“What 1
can’tunderstand iswhytheywanted todo itatall.They didn’t have
toCertainly notformysake.”
Shepicked upacigarette box,extended ittohim,then held the
flame ofalighter tothetipofhiscigarette, inthedeliberate manner
751
ofwailing onhim.Shesmiled inanswer tohischuckle, then sat
down onthearmofachair across theroom.
"‘Why didyouaccept their invitation. Hank?” sheasked, “You’ve
always refused tojointhem,”
“Ididn't want torefuse apeace offer—when I’vebeaten them
andtheyknow it.I'llnever jointhem, butaninvitation toappear
asaguest ofhonor— well. Ithought theyweregood losers. Jthought
itwasgenerous ofthem.”
“Ofthem?”
“Are yougoing tosay:ofmeT'
“Hank! After allthethings they've done tostop you--'’
“1won. didn’t I?So lthought . ..Youknow, Ididn’t hold it
against them thatthey couldn't seethevalue oftheMetal sooner—
solong astheysaw itatlast.Hveryman learns inhisownwayand
time. Sure, Iknew' there wasalotofcowardice there, andenvyand
hypocrisy, but Ithought that thatwasonly thesurface- now.when
I'veproved myease,when I’veproved itsoloudly!—Ithought their
realmotive forinviting mewas their appreciation ottheMetal,
and—”
Shesmiled inthebrief space ofhispause: sheknew thesentence
hehadstopped himself from uttering: “—and forthat, Iwould for-
giveanyone anything
“But itwasn’t,” hesaid.“And Icouldn’t figure outwhat their
motive was.Dagny, Idon't think theyhadanymotive atall.They
didn’t give thatbanquet toplease me,ortogainsomething from
me,ortosave facewith thepublic. There wasnopurpose ofany
kindabout it,nomeaning. They didn't really carewhen they de-
nounced theMetal—andthey don't carenow. They’re not really
afraid that 1’ildrivethem alloffthemarket—theydon't careenough
even about thatDoyouknow what thatbanquet was like? It'sas
ifthey’d heard thatthere arevalues one issupposed tohonor and
this iswhat onedoes tohonor them-— sotheywent through the
motions, likeghosts pulled bysome sortofdistant echoes from a
better age. 1 . . .Jcouldn't stand it.”
She said, herface tight.“And youdon't think you’re generous!”
Heglanced upather: hiseyesbrightened toalook ofamusement
“Why dotheymake yousoangry'”
She said, hervoice low' tohide thesound oftenderness, “You
wanted toenjoy it ,.
“Itprobably serves meright. Ishouldn't have expected anything
Idon’tknow what itwas that 1wanted.”
“Jdo.”
“I've never liked occasions ofthat sort. 1don’t seewhy Iexpected
ittobedifferent, thistime. . . .Youknow, 1went tfiere feeling
almost asiftheMetal hadchanged everything, even people.”
“Oh yes.Hank, Iknow!”
“Well, itwasthewrong place toseek anything, ...Do^you remem-
ber?You saidonce thatcelebrations should beonly fo&rthosewho
havesomething tocelebrate.”
Thedotofherlighted cigarette stopped inmid-air; shesat still
258
Shehadnever spoken tohimofthatparty orofanything related to
hishome. Inamoment, sheanswered quietly, “Iremember/'*
“1know whatyoumeant ... Iknew itthen, too/*
Hewaslooking straight ather.Shelowered hereyes.
Heremained silent; when hespoke again, hisvoice wasgay.‘The

“Yes,” shewhispered; shewassmiling.
“Oh. tohellwiththem!" hesaidhappily, stretching hislegs, shift-

“I'llwake youup."
She sat,watching himasheremained silent.Hehadlooked tired
when hecame in;thelines ofexhaustion weregone from hisface
now.
“Dagny" heasked suddenly, histonehadchanged, there was
some hidden, earnest note inhisvoice, “why didn’t youwant tosee
meinpublic?"
“Idon’t want tobepartofyour . ..official life."
Hedidnotanswer; inamoment, heasked casually. “When did

“Ithink itwastwo . .no,three years ago."
“What didyoudo?"
“Went totheAdirondacks foramonth Came back inaweek."
“Ididthat liveyean ago.Only itwasOregon" Helay flatonhis

Shegotup.Sheapproached him, shestood bythesideofthe

didnotwanthimtoseeherfaceandtheeffort shewasmaking not

“You cantake afewweeks off,can'tyou?" hesaid.“Things are

“All right. Hank,” she said, forcing hervoice tosound calmly
toneless.
“Will you?”
“When doyouwant tostart?”
“Monday morning.”
“All right.”
Sheturned tostepaway. Heseized herwrist, pulled herdown,
swung herbody toliestretched full-length ontopofhim,heheld

pressing hermouth tohis,hisother handmoving from theshoulder
blades under herthinblouse toherwaist, toherlegs*Shewhispered,
'‘And yousay 1don't needyou *..!"
Shepulled herself away from him,andstood up,brushing herhair
offherface.Helay still,looking upather, hiseyesnarrowed, the
bright flicker ofsome particular interest inhiseyes, intent andfaintly
mocking. Sheglanced down: astrap ofhersliphadbroken, theslip
hung diagonally from heroneshoulder toherside,andhewaslook-
ingatherbreast under thetransparent filmoftheblouse. Sheraised
herhand toadjust thestrap.Heslapped herhanddown. Shesmiled,
inunderstanding, inanswering mockery. Shewalked slowly, deliber-
ately across theroom andleaned against atable, facing him, her
hands holding thetable's edge, hershoulders thrown back. Itwas
thecontrast heliked— theseverity ofherclothes andthehalf-naked
body, therailroad executive whowasawoman heowned.
Hesatup;hesatleaning comfortably across thecouch, hislegs
eiossed andstretched forward, hishands inhispockets, looking at
herwith theglance ofaproperty appraisal.
“Did yousayyouwanted atranscontinental track ofRearden
Metal. Mr.Vice-President?" heasked. “What if 1don't give itto
you? Icanchoose mycustomers nowanddemand anyprice lplease.
Ifthiswere ayear ago. Iwould havedemanded thatyousleep with

“1wishyouhad."
“Would youhavedone it?"
'Ofcourse"
“Asamatter otbusiness* Asasale?"
“Ityouwere thebuyer Youwould have liked that, wouldn't

'Would you?"
"Yes .."shewhispered.
Heapproached her,hegrasped hershoulders andpressed his
mouth toherbreast through thethin cloth.
Then, holding her,helooked athersilently foralongmoment.
“What didyoudowith thatbracelet?" heasked.
Theyhadnever referred to it;shehadtoletamoment pass to
regain thesteadiness ofhervoice. “Ihave it."sheanswered.
"Iwantyoutowear it."
“Itanyone guesses, itwillbeworse foryouthan forme."
"Weat it.'*
Shebrought outthebracelet ofRearden Metal. Sheextended it
tohimwithout aword; looking straight athim,thegreen-blue chain
glittering across herpalm. Holding herglance, heclasped thebrace-
letonherwrist. Inthemoment when theclasp clicked shutunder
hisfingers, shebent herheaddown tothem andkissed hishand.

Theearth went flowing under thehood ofthecar.Uncoiling from
among thecurves ofWisconsin’s hills, thehighway wastheonly
evidence ofhuman labor, aprecarious bridge stretched across asea
ofbrush, weeds and trees.Thesenrolled softly, insprays ofyellow
<indorange, with afewredjetsshooting uponthe hillsides, with
2ft 1
pools ofremnant green inthehollows, under apureblue sky.Among
thecolors ofapicture postcard, thecar’shood looked likethework
ofajeweler, with thesunsparkling on itschromium steel, and its
black enamel reflecting thesky.
Dagny leaned against thecenter ofthesidewindow, herlegs
stretched forward; sheliked thewide, comfortable space ofthecar’s
seatandthewarmth ofthesunonhershoulders; shethought that
thecountryside was beautiful.
“What I’dliketosee," saidRearden, “isabillboard."
Shelaughed: hehadanswered hersilent thought “Selling what
andtowhom? Wehaven't seen acarorahouse foranhour."
“'I'hat’s what ldon’t likeabout it."Hebent forward alittle, his
hands onthewheel; hewasfrowning. “Look atthatroad."
Thelong strip ofconcrete wasbleached tothepowdery gray ot
bones leftonadesert, asifsunandsnows hadeaten away thetraces
oftires, oilandcarbon, thelustrous polish ofmotion. Green weeds
rosefrom theangular cracks oftheconcrete. Noonehadused the
road orrepaired itformany years; butthecracks were few.
“It's agood road." saidRearden. “Itwas built tolast. Iheman
who built itmust have hadagood reason torexpecting ittocairv
aheavy traffic intheyears ahead."
“Yes ..."
'[don't likethelooks ofthis."
“Idon't either" Then shesmiled “Hut thinkhow often we’ve

They could speak oftheir work, asthey always had, with full

Theywere seventy miles andanhourawayfrom it,when shesaid.

“He will.Who’s going tostophimnow?”
“Hank,” shesaidsuddenly, “could wegotoaplace I'dliketo

“Sure. Anywhere. Which place?”
“It’s inWisconsin. There used tobeagreatmotor company there,

think it'soneofthose blighted areas now.Maybe there’s stillsome

overlooked —theplace isforgotten andthere's notransportation to

“I’ll find it.What wasthename ofthefactory?”
“The Twentieth Century Motor Company”
“Oh, ofcourse IThaiwasoneofthebestmotor firms inmyyouth,
perhaps thebest. Iseem toremember thattherewassomething odd
about theway itwent outofbusiness . .can't recall what itwas.”
Ittookthem three days ofinquiries, buttheyfound thebleached,
abandoned road—andnow theywere driving through theyellow
leaves that glittered likeaseaofgold coins, totheTwentieth Cen-
turyMotor Company.
“Hank,*what ifanything happens toTedNielsen?” sheasked sud-
denly, astheydrove insilence
“Why should anything happen tohim?”
“1don’t know, but . . .well, there wasDwight Sanders. Hevan

power?”
“Ofwhat use isanything, forthatmatter, without it?”
Theleaves sparkled, swaying inthewind. They spread formiles,
from grass tobrush totrees, with themotion and ailthecolors of
fire:theyseemed tocelebrate anaccomplished purpose, burning in
unchecked, untouched abundance.
Rearden smiled. “There’s something tobesaid for thjbwilderness
I’mbeginning tolike it.Newcountry thatnobody’s discovered.” She
nodded gaily. “It’sgood soil—look atthewaythings gifow, I’ddear

Andthentheystopped smiling. Thecorpse theysawintheweeds

Itwastheonly thing left visible. Thefewcharred posts, theslab
ofconcrete andthesparkle ofglass dust—which hadbeen agas
station—wereswallowed inthebrush, nottobenoticed except bya
careful glance, nottobeseen atallinanother year.
They looked away.They drove on,notwanting toknow what else
layhidden under themiles ofweeds. They leltthesamewonder like
aweight inthesilence between them: wondci astohowmuch the
weeds hadswallowed andhow fast.

Afewhouses stillstood within theskeleton ofwhat hadonce
been anindustrial town. Everything thatcould move, hadmoved
away; butsomehuman beings hadremained. Theempty structures
were vertical rubble; theyhadbeen eaten, notbytune, butbymen:
boards tornout atrandom, missing patches olroofs, holes left in
gutted cellars. Itlooked as itblind hands hadseized whatever fitted

Beyond thetown, onadistant hill,stood thefactory oftheTwenti-
eth Century Motor Company. Itswalls, roof linesandsmokestacks
looked trim,impregnable likeafortress. Hwould haveseemed intact

Theysawnotrace ofaroad tothefactory inthetangled miles of
treesand hillsides They drove tothedoor ofthe tirsthouse insight
thatshowed afeeble signal ofrising smoke. Thedoorwasopen.An
oldwoman came shuffling oat atthesound ofthemotor. Shewas
bentandswollen, barefooted, dressed inagarment offlour sacking.
Shelooked atthecarwithout astonishment, without curiosity; itwas
theblank stare ofabeingwhohad lostthecapacity tofeelanything
butexhaustion,
“Can you tellmetheway tothefactory?" asked Rearden.
Thewoman didnotanswer atonce; shelooked asitshewould
beunable tospeak English. “What factory?" sheasked.
Rearden pointed, “That one."
“it’s closed."
“1know it’sdosed. But isthere anyway togetthere?"
“Idon't know.1'
“Isthere anysortofroad?"
265
’"There’s roads inthewoods,"
“Any foracartodrive through?"
“Maybe."
“Well, which would bethebestroad totake?"
“Idon’t know."
Through theopen door, theycould seetheinterior ofherhouse.
There wasauseless gasstove, itsoven stuffed with rags, serving as
achest ofdrawers, Ibere wasastove built ofstones inacomer,
with afewlogsburning under anoldkettle, andlong streaks ofsoot
rising upthewall.Awhite object laypropped against thelegsofa
table: itwasaporcelain washbowl, tornfrom thewallofsome bath-
room, filled with wilted cabbages. Atallow candle stood inabottle
onthetable. There wasnopaint leftonthefloor; itsboards were
scrubbed toasoggy gray thatlooked likethevisual expression of
thepain inthebones oftheperson whohadbentandscrubbed
and lostthebattle against thegrime nowsoaked into thegrain of
theboards.
Abrood ofragged childien hadgathered atthedour behind the
woman, silently, onebyone.They stared atthecar.notwith the
bright curiosity ofchildren, butwith thetension ofsavages ready to
vanish atthe firstsign ofdanger.
“How many miles isittothefactory?" asked Reardon.
“Ten miles,” said thewoman, andadded, “Maybe five”
“How far isthenexttown?”
“There ain’tanynexttown."
“There areother towns somewhere. Imean, how far'*"
“Yeah, Somewhere.’’

Dagny wasstaring atthetwobuckets: theywere square tinswith

“There’s plenty ofroads.”

Hehailpressed theslat let,when arockcame smashing intothe
windshield: The glass wasshatterproof, butasunburst ofcracks
spread across it.They saw atagged littlehoodlum vanishing behind

otchildren answering him Immbehind some windows orcrevices,
Kearden suppressed aswear word. Themanlooked vapidly across
thestreet, frowning alittle. Iheoldwoman looked on.without reac-
tion,Shehadstood there silently, watching, without interest orpur
pose, likeachemical compound onaphotographic plate, absorbing
visual shapes because theywere there tobeabsorbed, butunable
ever toform anyestimate oftheobjects ofhervision,
Dagny hadbeen studying herforsome minutes. The swollen
shapelessness ofthewoman’s body didnotlook liketheproduct of
267
ageandneglect: itlooked asifshewaspregnant. Thisseemed impos-
sible, butglancing closer Dagny sawthatherdust-colored hairwas
notgrayand thatthere were fewwrinkles onherface; itwasonly
thevacant eyes, thestooped shoulders, theshuffling movements that
gave herthestamp ofsenility.
Dagny leaned outandasked,“How oldareyou?'*
Thewoman looked ather,not inresentment, butmerely asone
looks atapointless question. “Thirty-seven,” sheanswered.
They haddriven fiveformer blocks away, whenDagny spoke,
“Hank,” shesaid interror, “thatwoman isonlytwoyears older
than 1!”
“Yes.”
“God, howdidtheyevercome tosuch astate?”
Heshrugged, “Who isJohn Galt?”
The lastthing theysaw, asthey leftthetown, wasabillboard. A
design was still visible on itspeeling strips, imprinted inthedead
gray thathadoncebeen color. Itadvertised awashing machine.
Inadistant field,beyond thetown, theysawthefiguie ofaman
moving slowly, contorted bytheugliness ofaphysical effort beyond
theproper useofahuman body: hewaspushing aplow byhand.
They reached thefactory oftheTwentieth Century Motor Com-
panytwomiles andtwohours later.They knew, astheyclimbed the
hill,that their quest wasuseless. Arusted padlock hungonthedoor
ofthemain entrance, hutthehugewindows were shattered andthe
place wasopen toanyone, tothewoodchucks, therabbits andthe
dried leaves that layindrifts inside
Thefactory hadbeen gutted long ago.Thegreat pieces ofmachin-
ery'hadbeenmoved outbysome civilized means—theneat holes of
their bases stillremained intheconcrete oftheflooi. Jheresthad
gone torandom looters. There wasnothing left,except refuse which
theneediest tramp hadfound worthless, piles oftwisted, rusted
scraps, ofboards, plaster andglass splinters—andthesteel stairways,
built tolastand lasting, rising intrim spiials totheroof.
They stopped inthegreat hallwhere arayoflight felldiagonally
from agap intheceiling, andtheechoes oftheir steps rangaround
them, dying faraway inrows ofempty rooms.Abirddarted from
among thesteel rafters andwent inahissing streak ofwings out
intothesky.
“We’d better lookthrough it.just incase.” saidDagny “You take
theshops and I’lltake theannexes. Let’sdo itasfastaspossible.”
“idon’t liketoletyouwander around alone. Idon’tknow how-
safethey are,anyofthose floors orstairways.”
“Oh, nonsense! 1canfindmywayaround afactory—ortnawreck-
ingcrew. Let’s get itover with. Iwant togetoutofhere.”'
When shewalked through thesilent yards—where steel, bridges
stillhung overhead, tracing lines ofgeometrical perfection across the
sky—heronlywishwasnottoseeanyofu,butsheforceaherself
tolook. Itwas likehaving toperform anautopsy onthe?txxly of
one’s love. Shemoved herglance asanautomatic searchlight, her
teethdamped tight together. Shewalked rapidly -there wasnone-
cessity topause anywhere.

Itwasinaroom ofwhathadbeen thelaboratory thatsheslopped.
Itwasacoilofwire thatmade herstop.The coilprotruded from a
pileofjunk.Shehadnever seen thatparticular arrangement ofwires,
yet itseemed familiar, asifittouched thehintofsome memory,
faintandvery distant. Shereached forthecoil,butcould notmove
it:itseemed tobepartofsome object buried inthepile.
Theroom looked asifithadbeen anexperimental laboratory—
ifshewasright injudging thepurpose ofthetornremnants shesaw
onthewalls: agreatmany electrical outlets, bitsofheavy cable, lead
conduits, glass tubing, built-in cabinets without shelves ordoors.
There wasagreat dealofglass, rubber, plastic andmetal inthejunk
pile,anddark gray splinters ofslate thathadbeen ablackboard.
Scraps otpaper rustled dryly allover thefloor. There were also
remnants ofthings which hadnotbeen brought herebytheowner
ofthatroom: popcorn wrappers, awhiskey bottle, aconfession
magazine.
Sheattempted toextricate thecoilfrom thescrap pile. Itwould
notmove; itwaspartofsome large object. Shekneltandbegan to
digthrough thejunk.
Shehadcutherhands, shewascovered withdustbythetimeshe
stood uptolook attheobject shehadcleared. Itwasthebroken
remnant ofthemodel ofamotor. Most ofitsparts were missing,
butenough was lefttoconvey some ideaofitsformer shape and
purpose.
Shehadnever seen amotor ofthiskind oranything resembling
it.Shecould notunderstand thepeculiar design ofitsparts orthe
functions theywere intended toperform.
Sheexamined thetarnished tubes andodd-shaped connections.
She tried toguess their purpose, hermind going overevery typeof
motor sheknew andevery possible kind ofwork itsparts could
perform None fitted themodel. Itlooked likeanelectric motor, but
shecould not tellwhat fuel itwasintended toburn. Itwasnot
designed forsteam, otoil,oranything shecould name.
Hersudden gaspwasnotasound, butajoltthatthrew heratthe
junk pile.Shewasonherhands andknees, crawling over thewreck-
age,seizing every piece ofpaper insight, flinging itaway, searching
further. Herhands were shaking.
Shefound partofwhat shehoped hadremained inexistence. It
wasathinsheaf oftypewritten pages clamped together—theremnant
ofamanuscript. Itsbeginning andendwere gone; thebitsofpaper
leftunder theclamp showed thethicknumber ofpages ithadonce

From theempty enclosure oftheplant’s powerhouse, Rcarden

There wasnospark ofexcitement inhis(ace.He slowly.
“Who designed it?Whywas itlefthere?”
“We’ll findout.”
Heweighed thepages inhishand reflectively. “Dagny/* heasked,

“Itwould have? Itwill.I’mgoing tofindthemanwhomade it.”
“We’ll try.”
Herose abruptly, butstopped toglance down atthebroken rem-

Then hespoke inthebrusque manner ofanexecutive. ‘"First, well

They started out,butshestopped foramoment onthethreshold.
“Hank, thatmotor wasthemost valuable thing inside thisfactory,”
shesaid,hervoice low. “Itwasmore valuable than thewhole factory
andeverything itever contained. Yet itwaspassed upand left in

‘That’s what frightens meabout this,” heanswered.
Thepersonnel office didnottakethem long.They found itbythe
signwhich was leftonthedoor, but itwastheonly thing left.There
wasnofurniture inside, nopapers, nothing butthesplinters of
smashed windows.
Theywentback totheroom ofthemotor. Crawling onhands and
knees, theyexamined every scrap ofthejunk that littered thefloor.
There was little tofind.They putaside thepapers thatseemed to
contain laboratory notes, butnone referred tothemotor, andthere
werenopages ofthemanuscript among them.Thepopcorn wrappers
andthewhiskey bottle testified tothekind ofinvading hordes that
had rolled through theroom, likewaves washing theremnants of
destruction away tounknown bottoms.
They putaside afew bitsofmetal thatcould have belonged to
themotor, butthesewere toosmall tobeofvalue. Themotor looked
as ifparts of ithadbeen ripped off,perhaps bysomeone who
thought hecould putthem tosome customary use.What had re-
mained wastoounfamiliar tointerest anybody.
Onaching knees, herpalms spread flatupon thegritty floor, she
felttheanger trembling within her,thehurting, helpless anger that
answers thesight ofdesecration. Shewondered whether someone’s

whether itswheels hadbecome arope pulley over acommunal

Chapter XWYATT'S TORCH
“God havemercy onus,ma’am!” said theclerk oftheHalt ofRe-
cords. "Nobody knows whoowns that factory now. 1guess nobody
willeverknow it.”
The clerk satatadesk inaground-floor office, where dust lay
undisturbed onthe filesandfew visitors ever called. Helooked atthe
shining automobile parked outside hiswindow, inthemuddy square
thathadoncebeen thecenter ofaprosperous county seat:helooked
with afaint, wistful wonder athistwounknown visitors.
"Why?” asked Dagny.
Hepointed helplessly atthemass ofpapers hehadtaken outof
thehies.‘The court willhave todecide whoowns it,which 1don’t
think anycourt cando. Ifacourt ever gets toit.Idon’t think itwill”
"Why? What happened?”
"Well, itwassoldout--theTwentieth Century, Imean. 'HieTwenti-
ethCentury Motor Company. Itwassold twice, atthesame timeand
totwodifferent setsofowners Thatwas sortofabigscandal atthe
lime twoyears ago,andnow it’sjust”- -hepointed—"just abunch
ofpaper lying around, waiting foracourt hearing, Idon’t seehow
anyjudge willbeable tountangle anyproperty rights outofit—or
any right atall.”
"Would you tellmeplease justwhat happened'^”
"Well, the lastlegalowner ofthefactory wasThePeople's Mort-
gageCompany, ofRome, Wisconsin. That’s thetown theother side
ofthefactory, thirty miles north. ThatMortgage Company wasasort
ofnoisy outfit thatdidalotofadvertising about easy credit Mark
Yonts was thehead of it.Nobody knew where hecame fromand
nobody knows where he’sgone tonow. butwhat they discovered, the
morning afterThe People’s Mortgage Company collapsed, wasthat
Mark Yonts hadsoldtheTwentieth Century Motor factory toabunch
ofsuckers IromSouth Dakota, andthathe'd alsogiven itascollateral
foraloanfrom abank inIllinois. Andwhen theytook alook atthe
factory, theydiscovered thathe'dmoved allthemachinery' outand
sold itpiece-meal, God onlyknows where andtowhom. So itseems
likeeverybody owns theplace— andnobody. That’s how itstands
now—theSouth Dakotans and thebank and theattorney forthe
creditors ofIhePeople's Mortgage Company allsuing oneanother,
allclaiming thisfactory, andnobody having theright tomove awheel
init,except that there’s nowheels lefttomove.”
"DidMark Yonts operate thefactory before hesold it?”
"Lord, no,ma'am! Hewasn’t thekind thateveroperates anything.
Hedidn’t want tomake money, only toget it.Guess hegot it,too—
more thananyone could havemade outofthat factory.”
Hewondered why theblond, hard-faced man,who satwith the
woman infront ofhisdesk, looked grimly outthewindow attheir
273
car,atalarge object wrapped incanvas, roped tightly under theraised
cover ofthecar's luggage compartment.
“What happened tothefactory records?”
“Which doyoumean, ma'am?”
“Their production records. Their work records. Their . ..person-
nelfiles.”
“Oh, there's nothing leftofthatnow. There’s been alotofUniting
going on.Allthemixed owners grabbed what furniture orthings they
could haul outofthere, even ifthesheriff didputapadlock onthe
door.Thepapers and stuff likethat—Iguess itwas alltaken bythe
scavengers from Starncsville, that’s theplacedown inthevalley, where
they're having itpatty tough these days.They burned thestuff for
kindling, most likely.”
“Isthere anyone leftherewho used towork inthefactory?”
asked Rearden.
“No, sir.Notaround here.They allliveddown inStarnesville.”
“All ofthem?” whispered Dagny; shewasthinking ottheruins
“The .. .engineers, too?”
“Yes, ma’am. Thatwasthefactory town. They’ve allgone, long
ago.”
“Do youhappen toremember thenames ofanymenwho
worked there?”
“No,ma’am.”
“What owner wasthelasttooperate thefactory?” asked Rearden.
“Icouldn’t say. sir.There’s been somuch trouble uptheieandthe
place haschanged hands somany times, since oldJedStarnes died
He’s themanwho built thefactory'. Hemade thi^whole partofthe
country, Iguess.Hedied twelve years ago.”
“Can yougive usthenames ofalltheowneis since?”
“No. sir.Wehadafire intheoldcourthouse, about three years
ago,and alltheoldrecords aregone 1don’tknow where youcould
tracethemnow”
“You don'tknow how thisMark Yonls happened toacquire the
factory?”
“Yes, Iknow that.Hebought itfromMayor Bascom olRome.
HowMayor Bascom happened toown it. 1don't know.”
“Where isMayor Bascom now9”
“Soil there, inRome”
“Thank you very'much,” saidRearden. rising. “We’ll callonhim”
They were atthedoorwhen theclerk asked. “What isityou’re
looking for,sir?”
“We’re looking forafriend ofours,” saidRearden. “Afriend we’ve
lost,whoused towork inthat factory.”

Mayor Bascom ofRome. Wisconsin, leaned back inhischair; his
chestandstomach formed apear-shaped outline under hissoited shirt.
The airwasamixture ofsunand dust, pressing heavily ujwn the
porch ofhishouse. Hewaved hisarm, theringonhisfinger? flashing
alarge topaz ofpoor quality.
“No use,nouse, lady, absolutely nouse”hesaid.“Woul4 bejust
awaste ofyour time, trying toquestion thefolksaround here. There's
274
nofactory people left,andnobody thatwould remember much about
them. wSomany families havemoved away thatwhat’s lefthere isplain
nogood, ifldosaysomyself, plainnogoodt justbeingMayor ofa
bunch oftrash.”
Hehadoffered chairs tohistwo visitors, buthedidnotmind itif
theladypreferred tostand attheporch railing. Heleaned back, study-
ingherlong-lined figure; high-class merchandise, hethought; butthen,
theman withherwasobviously rich.
Dagny stood looking atthestreets ofRome. There were houses,
sidewalks, lampposts, even asign advertising soft drinks; butthey
looked asifitwerenowonly amatter ofinches andhours before the
townwould reach thestage ofSlarnesville.
“Naw. there’s nofactory records left.*’ saidMayor Bascom. “If
that's whatyouwant tofind, lady, give itup. It’slikechasing leaves
inastorm now. Just likeleaves inastorm.Who cares about papers?
Atatime like this,what people save isgood, solid, material objects.
One's gottobepractical.”
Through thedusty windowpanes, theycould seethelivingroom of
hishouse: there were Persian rugsonabuckled wooden fioor, aporta-
blebarwithchomium stops against awallslamed bytheseepage of
lastyear srains, anexpensive radio withanoldkerosene lamp placed
onlopof it.
“Sure, it'smethatsoldthefactory loMark Yonls. Mark wasanice

butwhodoesn't? Ofcourse, hewent abntootarThat, fdidn't expect.
1thought hewassmart enough tostaywithin thelaw— whatever's left
of itnowadays.”
Mayor Bascom smiled, looking atthemmamanner olplacid frank-
ness Hiseyeswere shrewd without intelligence, hissmile good-
natured without kindness.
“Idon't think you folks aredetectives.” hesaid, “buteven ifyou
were, itwouldn't matter tome. 1didn't getanyrake-off fromMark,
hedidn't letmeinonanyofhisdeals, 1haven't anyideawhere he's
gone tonow”Hesighed.‘1liked that fellow. Wish he’d stayed
around Never mind theSunday sermons. Hehadtolive, didn't he?
Hewasnowoise thananybody, only smarter. Some getcaught atit

rubber, andamayor's inaposition tostretch them abitforafriend.
Well, what thehell? 1hat's theonlywayanybody ever gets rich in
thisworld”-- -heglanced attheluxurious black car—“asyouought
toknow.”
"You were telling usabout thefactory.” saidRearden, trying to
control himself.
“What 1can't stand,” saidMayor Bascom, “ispeople who talk
about principles. Noprinciple ever filled anybody's milk bottle. The
only thing thatcounts inlife issolid, material assets. It'snotime for
275
theories, when everything isfalling topieces around us.Well,me—l
don't aimtogounder. Letthem keep their ideas and I’lltake the
factory. Idon’t want ideas, Ijustwantmythree square meals aday.”
“Why didyoubuy thatfactory?”
“Why doesanybody buyanybusiness? Tosqueeze whatever can

So Igottheplace forpeanuts. Didn’t have tohold itlong, either—

better with it.”
'Was thefactory operating when youtook itover?”
"Naw. Itwasshutdown.”
“Didyouattempt toreopen it?”
"Not me.I’mapractical person.”
"Can you recall thenames ofanymenwhoworked there?”
"No.Never met’em.”
“Did youmove anything outofthefactor)'7”
"Well. HItellyou. Itook alookaround— andwhat Ilikedwasold

"Whose bankruptcy salewas it,when youbought thefactory?”
"Oh, thatwasthebigclash oftheCommunity National Hank in
Madison. Boy,wasthat acrash! Itjustabout finished thewhole state
ofWisconsin —sure finished thispartofit.Some say itwas thismotor
factory thatbroke thebank, butothers say itwasonly the lastdrop
inaleaking bucket, because theCommunity National hadbum invest-
ments allover three orfour states. Eugene Lawson wasthehead of
it.Thebanker with aheart, they called him.Hewasquitefamous in
these parts two-three years ago.”
“DidLawson operate thefactory>”
“No.Hemerely lentanawful lotofmoney on it,more thanhe
could everhope togetback outoftheolddump. When thefactory
busted, thatwasthe laststraw forGene Lawson. Thebank busted
three months later.” Hesighed. "Ithitthefolks pretty hardaround
here.They allhadtheir lifesavings intheCommunity National.”
Mayor Bascom looked regretfully past hisporch ratling athistown.
Hejerked histhumb atafigure across thestreet: itwasawhite-hatred
charwoman, moving painfully onherknees, scrubbing thesteps of
ahouse,
"See thatwoman, forinstance? They used tobesolid, respectable
folks. Herhusband owned thedry-goods store.Heworked jailhis life
toprovide forher inheroldage,andhedid, too,bythjctime he
died—only themoney wasmtheCommunity National Ba(tk.”
“Who operated thefactory when itfailed?”
“Oh, thatwassome quicky corporation called Amalgamated Ser-
276
vice. Inc.Justapuff-ball. Came upoutofnothing andwent back
toit.”
“Where are itsmembers?”
“Where arethepieces ofapuff-ball when itbursts? Tryandtrace
them allover theUnited States. Try it.”
“Where isEugene Lawson?”
“Oh. him? He’sdone allright. He’s gotajobinWashington —in
theBureau ofEconomic Planning andNational Resources.”
Reardcn rosetoo fast,thrown tohisfeetbyajoltofanger, then
said, controlling himself, “Thank you fortheinformation.11
“You’re welcome, friend, you’re welcome,” saidMayor Bascom
placidly. “1don’tknow what itisyou’re after, buttakemyword for
it,give itup.There’s nothing more tobehadoutofthat factory.”
“Itoldyou thatwearclooking forafriend ofours.”
“Well, have ityourway.Must beapretty good Iriend, ifyou'll go
tosomuch trouble tofindhim,youandthecharming ladywho is

Dagny sawReardens facegowhite, sothateven hislipsbecame
asculptured feature, indistinguishable against hisskin.“Keep your
dirty—”hebegan, butshestepped between them.
“Why doyouthink that lamnothiswife?” sheasked calmly.
Mayor Bascom Ux>ked astonished byRearden’s reaction: hehad
made theremark without malice, merely likeafellow cheat displaying
hisshrewdness tohispartners inguilt.
“Lady. I’veseen alotinmylifetime.” hesaid good-naturedly.
“Married people don't look asiftheyhave abedroom ontheirminds
when theylook ateach other Inthisworld, either you're virtuous or
youenjoy yourself. Notboth, lady, notboth.”
“I’ve asked himaquestion.” shesaid toRcarden intime tosilence
him.“He's givenmeaninstructive explanation.”
“Ifyouwant atip,lady,” saidMayor Bascom. “get yourself awed-
ding ringfrom thedime store andwear it.It'snotsure lire, but
ithelps.”
'Thank you,” shesaid.“Good-bye”
The stern, stressed calm ofhermanner wasacommand thatmade
Reardon follow herback totheir carinsilence.
Theywere miles beyond tin*townwhen hesaid, notlooking ather,
hisvoice desperate andlow.“Dagny, Dagny, Dagny . . .Lmsorry!”
‘Tm not.”
Moments later,when shesawthelook ofcontrol returning U>his
face,shesaid,“Don’t ever getangry ataman forstating thetruth.”
“Thai particular truthwasnone ofhisbusiness.”
“His particular estimate of itwasnone ofyourconcern ormine.”
Hesaidthrough histeeth notasananswer, butasifthesingle
thought battering hisbrain turned intosounds against hiswill, “I
couldn’t protect youfrom thatunspeakable little—“
“Ididn’t need protection.’*
Heremained silent, notlooking ather
“Hank, when you’re able tokeepdown theanger, tomorrow or
nextweek, givesome thought tothatman’s explanation andsee if

Hejerked hishead toglance ather,hutsaidnothing.
When hespoke, along time later, itwasonly tosayinatired,

here tosearch thefactory. Wecan'tmeetthem here.Wecan’t let it

“LetmecallEddie, whenwefindatelephone. I’llhavehimsend

They drove twohundred miles before theyfound along-distance

hervoice.
“Dagny! ForGod’s sake, where arcyou?”
“InWisconsin. Why?”
“1didn’t know where toreach you.You’d better come back at

“What happened?”
“Nothing vet.Butthere arcthings going on,which ...You’d better

“No.”
“Ican ttellyouover thephone. Ican’t giveyou allthedetails.

‘Tilcome back atonce,” shesaid.

Cut into thegranite otManhattan, under theTaggart Terminal,
there were tunnels which hadonce been used assidings, atatime
when traftic raninclicking currents through every artery oftheTermi-
nalevery hour oftheday. ITieneed forspace hadshrunk through
theyears, with theshrinking olthe trathe, and thesidetunnels had

Dagny placed theremnant ofthemotor into avault inone otthe

which hadbeenremoved long ago.Shedidnottrust theuseless young

When herworkers carried themotor down tothevault andde-

stopped, key inhand, as ifthesilence and solitude hadsuddenly
thrown Iict attheproblem shehadbeen facing lordays, as ifthis

Her office carwaswaiting forheratoneoftheTerminal platforms,

shehadtoldherself thatshewould cancel itandpostpone herquest—
278
ifshecould think ofsome action totake against thethings shehad
found onherreturn toNew York, thethings Eddie begged herto
fight.
Shehad tried tothink, butshecouid seenowayoffighting, no

Wesley Mouch. TopCo-ordinator oftheBureau ofEconomic Plan-

Ihewords "emergency powers1'and"unbalanced economy" kept ap-
pearingmthetextevery tew lines
"Dagny, bywhat right?" Eddie Willem hadasked her, hisvoice
quiet, butthewords sounding likeacry"Bywhat right arethey all

Shehadconfronted James Taggart inhisoffice and said, "Jim, this
isyour battle. I'vefought mine. You're supposed toheanexpert at

Taggart had said, notlooking ather,"You can’t expect torunthe

"Who wants ashare ofit?Inpayment forwhat?" Hehadnot

Itdidnotseem realtoher.here, under theground. Thinking of it
here, sheknew shecould havenopart inJim's battle. There wasno
action shecould take against themen ofundefined thought, ofun-
named motives, ofunstated purposes, ofunspecified morality. There

Sheturned resolutely and lettthevault, totake thetram for

Itseemed toher, asshelocked thesteel door, thatsheheard a

Rcarden aiuld not fight thegangswhodemanded thelaws.The
choice wastotightthem ortokeep hismills open.Hehad lost his
supply ofiron ore.Hehadtofightonebattle ortheother. There was
notime forboth.
Hehadfound, onhisreturn, thatascheduled shipment oforehad
notbeen delivered. Noword orexplanation hadbeen heard from
Larkin. When summoned toRearden’s office, Larkin appeared three
days later than theappointment made, offering noapology. Liesaid,
notlooking atReardcn, hismouth drawn tightly intoanexpression
ofrancorous dignity:
“After all,youcan’t order people tocome running toyour office
anytuneyouplease”
Rearden spoke slowly andcarefully. “Why wasn't theoiedelivered?”
“Iwon't take abuse, Isimply won’t takeanyabuse forsomething
Icouldn't help. Icanrunamine justaswell asyouran it.every bit
aswell. 1dideverything youdid—1don'tknowwhysomething keeps
going wrong unexpectedly allthetime. Ican't beblamed forthe

“Iowhom didyoushipyour ore lastmonth?”
“1intended toshipyouyour share ofit, Ifully intended it,but l
couldn’t help itifwelosttendaysofproduction lastmonth onaccount
oftherainstorm inthewhole ofnorth Minnesota—Iintended toship

pletely honest.”
“Ifoneofmyblast furnaces goesdown, will 1beable tokeep it

“That's whynobody candeal withyouortalk toyou—because
you're inhuman.”
“1have justlearned that forthe lastthree months, youhave not
been shipping yourorebythelake boats, youhavebeen shipping it
bytail.Why?”
“Well, after all, Ihave aright torunmybusiness as lsee fit.”
“Why areyouwilling topaytheextra cost?”
“What doyoucare? I'mnotcharging ittoyou.”
“What willyoudowhen youfind thatyoucan't afford the railrates
andthatyouhave destroyed thelakeshipping?”
“Iamsureyouwouldn't understand anyconsideration other than
dollars andcents, butsome people doconsider their social and patri-
oticresponsibilities.”
281
“What responsibilities?”
“Welt, lthink thatarailroad likeTaggart Transcontinental isessen-
tialtothenational welfare and itisone’s public duty tosupport Jim’s
Minnesota branch tine,which isrunning atadeficit.”
Rearden leaned forward across thedesk; hewasbeginning tosee
thelinks ofasequence hehadnever understood. “Towhom didyou
shipyour orelastmonth**” heasked evenly.
“Well, after all,that ismyprivate business which—”
“ToOrren Boyle, wasn't it?”
“You can't expect people tosacrifice theentire steel industry of
thenation toyour selfish interests and—”
“Get outofhere.” saidRearden. Hesaid itcalmly. Thesequence
wasclear tohimnow.
“Don’t misunderstand me, ldidn’tmean—”
“Get out.”
Larkin gotout.
Then there followed thedaysandnights ofsearching acontinent
byphone, bywire, byplane—oflooking atabandoned mines and at
mines ready tobeabandoned—oftense, rushed conferences held at
tables intheunlighted comers ofdisreputable restaurants. Looking
across thetable. Rearden hadtodecide howmuch hecould riskto
invest upon thesoleevidence ofaman’s face,manner andtone of
voice, hating thestate ofhaving tohope forhonesty asforafavor,
butrisking it,pouring money intounknown hands inexchange for
unsupported promises, into unsigned, unrecorded loans todumm>
owners offailing mines— money handed andtaken furtively, asan
exchange between criminals, manonymous cash,money poured into
unenforceable contracts— both parties knowing that inease offraud,
thedefrauded was tobepunished, notthedefrauder—butpoured
that astream oforemight continue flowing into furnaces, that the
furnaces might continue topour astream ofwhite metal.
“Mr. Rearcjen,” asked thepurchasing manager ofhismills, “ifyou
keep thatup,where willbeyour profit?”
“Well make itupontonnage,” saidRearden wearily. “We have
anunlimited market forRearden Metal“
Thepurchasing manager wasanelderly man with graying hair, a
lean, dryface,andaheart which, people said,wasgiven exclusively
tothetaskotsqueezing every lastounce ofvalue outofapenny. He
stood infront ofRearden sdesk, saying nothing else,merely looking
straight atRearden, hiscoldeyesnarrowed andgrim, ftwasalook
ofthemost profound sympathy thatRearden hadever seen.
There’s noother course open, thought Rearden, ashehadthought
through daysand nights. Heknew noweapons buttopayforwhat
hewanted, togivevalue forvalue, toasknothing ofnature without

“An unlimited market, Mr.Rearden?” thepurchasing [manager

Rearden glanced upathim. “Iguess I’mnotsmart enough tomake

Thepurchasing manager shook hishead. “No, Mr.Rearden, it’s

“Maybe lought toteam theirmethod.”
“You couldn’t learn itand itwouldn’t doyouanygood. You

When hewas leftatone, Rearden feltajoltofblinding anger, asit

Ihennorightful cause was left,andthepainofanger wasturning

Itwas latewhen hecamehome andhurried mMindlessly upthe

that thiswasnottheroot ofhishatred.

Hehadputonhispajamas andstopped tolight acigarette, when
thedoor ofhisbedroom opened, theonlyperson whocould properly

itwas Lillian whocame in.
Shewore anEmpire garment ofpale chartreuse, itspleated skirt

Shepaused inthedoorway, the lines ofherbody flowing intoan
attractive silhouette against the light.
“Iknow Ishouldn't introduce myself toastranger," shesaid softly,
“but I'llhave to:myname isMrs. Reardon." Hecould not tell
whether itwassarcasm oraplea.
Sheentered andthrew thedoor closed with acasual, imperious
gesture, thegesture ofanowner.
“What isit,Lillian?" heasked quietly.
“My dear, youmustn’t confess somuch sobluntly"—shemoved in
aleisurely manner across theroom, past hisbed,and satdown inan

“No," hesaid quietly, “not ifyouwish to."
“1have nothing weighty todiscuss— nomillion-dollar orders, no

Shelaughed: “And what isityou're being rightnow? You’re giving

“Oh, darling, don’t takemeseriously! I'mjusttalking.”
Heground hiscigarette intoanashtray: hedidnotanswer,

Shehadgivenhimhername; shedidnotknowwhyshenow felt
glad thathehadnotrecognized itandwhyshepreferred nottoen-

*Tneedsome information onthatmotor factory foraprivate purpose

“Oh.”Helooked disappointed. Hewentonsullenly, asifshewere
guilty ofadeliberate offense against him. “Ithought maybe youcame
foranadvance interview because I’mwriting myautobiography.” He
pointed tothepapers onthe table.“And what 1intend totell is
plenty. Iintend—Oh,hell!” hesaidsuddenly, remembering something.
Herushed tothestove, lifted the lidoffthepotandwent through
themotions ofstirring thestew, hatefully, paying noattention tohis
performance. He(lung thewetspoon down onthestove, letting the
grease drip intothegasburners, andcame back tothetable.
“Yeah. I’llwritemyautobiography //anybody ever givesmea

“Would youallowmetoaskyou afewquestions about themotor

“Don’t imagine that thatmotor factory wastheonly thing inmy
life.Fdheldmany important positions before. 1wasprominently con-
nected, atvarious times, with enterprises manufacturing surgical appli-

“How didyouhappen toacquire it?”
“Itwasmeant forme. Itwasm>dream come Hue. Hiefactory was

methrough thewringer.’"
She satupstraight. “Midas Mulligan?”
“Yeah—thebanker wholooked like atruck driver andacted it,
too!”
“Did youknow Midas Mulligan?”
“Did 1know him?Pmtheonlymanwhoever beathim-mot that
itdidmeanygood!”
Atoddmoments, with asudden sense ofuneasiness, shehadwon-
dered— asshewondered about thestones ofdeserted ships found
floating atseaorofsourccless lights flashing inthesky— about the
disappearance ofMidas Mulligan. There wasnoreason whyshe lelt
thatshehad tosolve these riddles, except thattheywere mysteries
which hadnobusiness being mysteries, theycould not )>ecauseless,
yetnoknown cause could explain them.
Midas Mulligan hadoncebeen therichest and, consequently, the
mostdenounced manmthecountry. Hehadnever taken alosson
anyinvestment hemade; everything hetouched turned intogold “It's
because 1know what totouch,” hesaid.Nobody could grasp the
pattern ofhisinvestments: herejected deals thatwere considered
flawlessly safe,andheputenormous amounts intoventures thatno
other banker would handle. Through theyears, hehadbeen the trig-
gerthathadsentunexpected, spectacular bullets otindustrial success
shooting over thecountry Itwashewhohadinvested inKearden
Steel atitsstart, thushelping Reardon tocomplete thepurchase ofthe
abandoned sttMd millsmPennsylvania When aneconomist referred to
himonce asanaudacious gambler. Mulligan said.“The reason why
you’ll never getrich isbecause youthink thatwhat ldo isgambling.”
Itwasrumored thatonehadtoobserve acertain unwritten rule
when dealing withMidas Mulligan: ifanapplicant foraloan ever
mentioned hispeisonal need oranypersonal feeling whatever, the
interview ended andhewasnever given another chance tospeak to
Mr.Mulligan.
“Why yes. Ican,” saidMidas Mulligan, when hewasasked whether
hecouldname aperson more evilthan theman with aheart closed
topity.“Themanwho usesanother's pity forhimasaweapon.”
Inhislong career, hehadignored allthepublic attacks onhim,
except one.His firstname hadbeen Michael; when anewspaper col-
umnist ofthehumanitarian clique nicknamed himMidas Mulligan and
thetagstuck tohim asaninsult. Mulligan appeared inerfurt and
petitioned foralegalchange ofhisfirstname to“Midas.” The*petition
wasgranted.
Intheeyesofhiscontemporaries, hewasamanwhohadcommitted
theoneunforgivable sin:hewasproud ofhiswealth.
294
These were thethings Dagny hadheard about Midas Mulligan; she
hadnever methim.Seven years ago,Midas Mulligan hadvanished.
He lefthishome onemorning andwasnever heard from again.On
thenextday,thedepositors oftheMulligan Bank inChicago received
notices requesting thattheywithdraw their funds, because thebank
was closing. Intheinvestigations thatfollowed, itwaslearned that
Mulligan hadplanned theclosing inadvance and inminute detail; his
employees were merely carrying outhisinstructions. Itwasthemost
orderly runonabank thatthecountry ever witnessed. Every deposi-
torreceived hismoney down tothe lastfraction ofinterest due. All
ofthebank’s assets hadbeen soldpiecemeal tovarious financial insti-
tutions. When thebooks were balanced, itwasfound thatthey bal-
anced perfectly, tothepenny; nothing was leftover; theMulligan
Bank hadbeenwiped out.
Noduewaseverfound toMulligan’s motive, tohispersonal fate
ortothemany millions ofhispersonal fortune. Jliemanand the
fortune vanished asiftheyhadnever existed. Noonehadhadany
warning about hisdecision, andnoevents could betraced toexplain
itIfhehadwished toretire--people wondered—whyhadn’t hesold
hisestablishment atahuge profit, ashecould have done, instead of
destroying it?There wasnobody togiveananswer. Hehadnotamily,
nofriends. Hisservants knew nothing: hehad lefthishome thatmorn-
ingasusual anddidnotcome back; thatwas all
There was—Dagny hadthought uneasily foryears—aquality ofthe
impossible about Mulligan's disappear ance; itwasasifaNewYork
skysciapcr hadvanished one night, leaving nothing behind butava-
cant lotonastreetcomer Aman likeMulligan, and afortune such
ashehadtaken along withhim, could notstayhidden anywhere; a
skvsciaper could notgetlost itwould beseen rising above anyplain
orlorest chosen fox itshiding place: were itdestroyed, even itspile
ofnibble could notremain unnoticed. ButMulligan hadgone—and
intheseven years since, inthemass ofrumors, guesses, theories,
Sunday supplement stones, andeyewitnesses whoclaimed tohave
seenhim inevery partoftheworld, noduetoaplausible explanation
hadeverbeen discovered.
Among thestories, therewasonesopreposterously outofcharacter
thatDagny believed ittobetrue: nothing inMulligan’s nature could
have given anyone ground toinvent it.Itwassaidthatthelastperson
toseehim,onthespring morning ofhisdisappearance, wasanold
woman who soldflowers onaChicago street comer bytheMulligan
Bank. Sherelated thathestopped andbought abunch oftheyear’s
first bluebells. Hisfacewas thehappiest faceshehadever seen; he
hailthelook ofayouth starting outintoagreat, unobstructed vision
ollifeKingopen before him; themarks ofpainandtension, the
sediment ofyears upon ahuman face,hadbeenwiped off,andwhat
remained wasonlyjoyous eagerness andpeace Hepicked upthe
flowers asifonasudden impulse, andhewinked attheoldwoman,
asifhehadsome shining joke toshare with her.Hesaid,“Doyou

him, bewildered, andhewalked away, tossing theflowers likeaball
inhishand—abroad, straight figure inasedate, expensive, business-
295
man's overcoat, going oftintothedistance against thestraight cliffs
ofoffice buildings with thespring sunsparkling ontheirwindows.
“Midas Mulligan wasavicious bastard with adollar signstamped
onhisheart/’ saidLeeHunsackcr. inthefumes oftheacrid stew.
“Mywhole future depended upon amiserable half-million dollars,
which was justsmall change tohim, butwhen lapplied foraloan,

“You didw/inrT'

No—thought Dagny— no,apart from thesickening feeling itgave
2%
her, thiscasewasnotmuch worse thananyoftheother things that
Midas Mulligan hadborne foryears.Hehadtakenmany losses under
lawsofasimilar justice, under rulesandedicts thathadcosthimmuch
larger sums ofmoney; hehadborne themandfought andworked the
harder; itwasnotlikely that thiscasehadbroken him.
“What happened toJudge Narragansetl?” sheasked involuntarily,
andwondered what subconscious connection hadmade herask it.
Sheknew little about Judge NarraganscU. butshehadheard and
remembered hisname, because itwasaname thatbelonged soexclu-
sively totheNorth American continent. Now sherealized suddenly
thatshehadheard nothing about him foryears.

“Yes. yes. itwasthere. Everything wasthere.”
“His staff, too?”

The ill-smelling bungalow, where shefound IvyStarnes, stood on

according tohisability, toeach according tohisneed. Everybody in
thefactory, fromcharwomen topresident, received thesame salary—
thebarest minimum necessary. Twice ayear,we allgathered ina
mass meeting, where every person presented hisclaim forwhathe
believed tobehisneeds.Wevoted onevery claim, andthewillof
themajority established every person’s needandevery person’s abil-

were based onneed, andthepenalties onability. Those whose needs
were voted tobethegreatest, received themost. Those whohadnot
produced asmuch asthevote saidthey could, were finedandhadto
paythefinesbyworking overtime without pay.Thatwasourplan. It
wasbased ontheprinciple ofselflessness. Itrequired men tobemoti-
vated, notbypersonal gain, butbylove fortheir brothers."
Dagny heard acold, implacable voice saying somewhere within her:
Remember it—remember itwell—itisnotoften thatonecanseepure

Thewoman whoopened thedoor hadgraying hairandapoised,
distinguished lookofgrooming; ittookDagny afewseconds torealize
thathergarment wasonlyasimple cotton housedress.
“May 1seeMr.William Hastings?” asked Dagny.
Thewoman looked atherforthebriefest instant ofapause; itwas
anoddglance, inquiring andgrave.“May {askyourname?”
“IamDagny Taggart, ofTaggart Transcontinental.”
“Oh, Please come in.Miss Taggart, IamMrs.William Hastings.”
Themeasured toneofgravity went through every syllable ofhervoice,
likeawarning. Hermanner wascourteous, butshedidnotsmile.
Itwasamodest home inthesuburbs ofanindustrial town. Bare
treebranches cutacross thebright, cold blueofthesky,onthetop
ofthe risethat ledtothehouse. The walls ofthelivingroom were
silver-gray; sunlight hitthecrystal stand ofalamp with awhite shade;
beyond anopen d<x>r, abreakfast nook waspapered mred-dotted
white.
“Were youacquainted withmyhusband inbusiness. MissTaggart?"
“No. Ihave never metMr.Hastings. But lshould liketospeak to
himonamatter ofbusiness ofcrucial importance.”
“Myhusband died fiveyears ago.Miss Taggart.”
Dagny closed hereyes; thedull,sinking shock contained theconclu-
sions shedid,nothave tomake inwords: Ibis, then, hadbeen the
manshewasseeking, andRearden hadbeen right; thiswaswhythe
motor hadbeen leftunclaimed onajunk pile.
“I'm sorry,” shesaid, both toMrs. Hastings andtoherself.
Thesuggestion ofasmile or»Mrs. Hastings' faceheld sadness, but
thefacehadnoimprint oftragedy, onlyagrave look offirmness,
acceptance andquiet serenity.
“Mrs. Hastings, would youpermit metoaskyouafewquestions?”
“Certainly. Please sitdown.”
“Didyouhavesome knowledge ofvourhusband's scientific work?”
“Very little. None, really.Henever discussed itathome.”
“He was, atone time, chief engineer oftheTwentieth Century
Motor Company?”
“Yes.Hehadbeenemployed bythem foreighteen yeans}”
“Iwanted toaskMr.Hastings about hiswork there andthereason
whyhegave itup. Ifyoucan tellme, Iwould like toMow what
happened inthat factory.”
Thesmile ofsadness andhumor appeared fullyonMrs. ^Hastings'
face,“That iswhat 1would tiketoknow myself,” shesaid,“But I’m
afraid Ishall never leam itnow. 1know whyheleftthefactory. It

wasbecause ofanoutrageous scheme which theheirs ofJedStarnes
established there.Hewould notwork onsuchterms orforsuch peo-
ple.Butthere wassomething else. I’vealways feltthatsomething
happened atTwentieth Century Motors, which hewould not tellme.”
"i’mextremely anxious toknow anydueyoumaycare togiveme/’
“1havenoclue to it.I’ve tried toguess andgiven up. Icannot
understand orexplain if.But 1know thatsomething happened. When
myhusband leftTwentieth Century, wecame hereandhetookajob
ashead oftheengineering department ofAnne Motors. Itwasa
growing, successful concern atthetime. Itgavemyhusband thekind
ofwork heliked.Hewas notaperson prone toinner conflicts, he
hadalways been sureofhisactions and atpeace with himself. But
forawhole year afterwe leftWisconsin, heacted asifhewere
tortured bysomething, asifhewere struggling with apersonal prob-
lemhecould notsolve. Attheendofthat year, hecame tomeone
morning andtoldmethathehadresigned fromAcme Motors, that
hewastetiring andwould notworkanywhere else.Heloved hiswork;
itwas hiswhole life.Yethelooked calm, self-confident andhappy,
forthe firsttime sincewedcome here.Heaskedmenottoquestion
himabout thereason ofhisdecision. Ididn't question himand I
didn't object.Wehad thishouse, wehadoursavings, wehadenough
toliveonmodestly fortherestofourdays. Inever learned hisreason.
Wewentonliving here, quietly andvery happily. Heseemed tofeel
nprofound contentment. Hehadanoddserenity ofspirit that lhad
never seen inhimbefore. There wasnothing strange inhisbehavior
oractivity- except that attimes, very lareiy, hewent outwithout
tellingmewhere hewent orwhom hesaw. Inthe lasttwoyears of
his life,hewentaway forvinemonth, eachsummer; hedidnot tell
mewhere. Otherwise, helived ashealways had.Hestudied agreat
dealandhespent histimeonengineering research ofhisown,working
inthebasement ofourhouse. 1don'tknow what hedidwith his
notes andexperimental models. Ifound notrace ofthemmthebase-
ment. after hisdeath. Hedied fiveyears ago,ofaheart ailment from
which hehadsuffered torsome time.”
Dagny asked hopelessly, “Didyouknow thenature ofhisexperi-
ments?”
"No. Iknow very littleabout engineering.”
"Didyouknow anyofhisprofessional friends orco-workers, who
might havebeen acquainted with hisresearch?”
"No.When hewas atTwentieth Century Motors, heworked such
longhours thatwehadvery little lime forourselves andwespent it
together. Wehadnosocial lifeatall.Henever brought hisassociates
tothehouse.”
"When hewas atTwentieth (entury, didheevermention toyou
amotor hehaddesigned, anentirely newtype ofmotor thatcould
havechanged thecourse ofailindustry?”
"Amotor? Yes. Yt\s,hespoke ofitseveral times.Hesaid itwas
aninvention ofincalculable importance. But itwasnothewhohad
designed itItwastheinvention ofayoung assistant ofhis.”
Shesawtheexpression onDagny’s face,andadded slowly, quizzi-
cally, without reproach, merely insadamusement, "isee.”
303
"Oh,Pmsorry I’*saidDagny, realizing thatheremotion hadshot
toherfaceandbecome asmile asobvious asacryofrelief.
"it's quite aillright. Iunderstand. It'stheinventor ofthatmotor
thatyou're interested in. 1don'tknow whether heisstill alive, butat

*Td give halfmy lifetoknow thathe is—andtofindhim. It'sas

"Idon't know. Idon’tknow hisname oranything about him. I
never knew anyofthemenonmyhusband's staff.Hetoldmeonly
thathehadayoung engineer who.some day,would up-tum theworld.
Myhusband didnotcare foranything inpeople except ability. Ithink
thiswastheonlymanheever loved. Hedidn't sayso.but Icould
tell it,justbythewayhespoke ofthisyoung assistant. Iremember—
thedayhetoldmethat themotor wascompleted—how hisvoice
sounded when hesaid.And he'sonly twenty-six!’ Ibiswasabout a

"You don'tknow whatbecame oftheyoung engineer?"
"No."
"You can't suggest anyway tofindhim?"
“No."
"You havenoclue,nolead tohelpmelearn hisname?”
"None. Tellme.was thatmotor extremely valuable?"
"More valuable thananyestimate 1could giveyou."
"It’s strange, because, you see, Ithought of itonce, some years
afterwe’d leftWisconsin, and 1askedmyhusband what hadbecome
ofthatinvention he'd saidwassogreat, whatwould bedone with it.
Helooked atmeveryoddly andanswered, ‘Nothing.’"
"Why?"
"Hewouldn't tellme."
"Can youremember anyone atallwhoworked atTwentieth Cen-
tury?Anyone .whoknew thatyoung engineer? Any friend ofhis?"
"No, 1 , ..Wait! Wait, Ithink Icangiveyoualead. 1can tellyou
where tofindonefriend ofhis. Idon’t evenknow that friend’s name,
either, but 1know hisaddress. It'sanodd story. I'dbetter explain
how ithappened. One evening—about twoyears after we’dcome
•here—myhusband wasgoing outand Ineeded ourcarthat night, so
heaskedmetopickhimupafter dinner attherestaurant ofthe

When Idrove uptothestation, lsawhimstanding outside therestau-

elderly; helooked very distinguished. Iwould stillrecognize those
menanywhere; theyhad thekind offaces onedoesn't forget.My
husband sawmeand leftthem. They walked away toward thestation
platform: there was atrain coming. Myhusband pointed kfter the
young manand said, "Didyouseehim? That’s theboy I$oldyou
about.' 'Theonewho’s thegreatmaker ofmotors?’ Ibebnewho

"And hetoldyounothing else?"
"Nothing else.Thiswasnineyears ago.Last spring, Iweitt tovisit
mybrother who lives inCheyenne. Oneafternoon, hetook thefamilym
outtoralong drive.Wewentupintopretty wildcountry, high inthe

wewere milesaway Irom thedmei, when Iremembered. You'd better

Thediner stood onthesummit ofalong, hard climb. Itsglass wails
spread acoal ofpolish over theview ofrocks andpines descending
mbroken ledges tothesunset. Itwasdarkbelow, butaneven, glowing
light stillremained inthediner, asinasmall pool leftbehind bya
receding tide.
Dagny satattheendofthecounter, eating ahamburger sandwich.
Itwasthebest-cooked food shehadever tasted, theproduct ofsimple
ingredients andofanunusual skill.Twoworkers were finishing their
dinner: shewaswatting forthem todepart.
Shestudied themanbehind thecounter. Hewasslender and tall,
hehadanairofdistinction thatbelonged toanancient castle orin
theinner office ofabank: buthispeculiar quality came from thefact
thathemade the distinction seem appropriate here, behind the
counter ofadiner.Hewore acook’s white jacket asifitwere afull-
dress suit. There wasanexpert competence inhismanner ofworking;
hismovements were easy, intelligently economical Hehadaleanface
andgray hair thatblended intone with theadd blueofhiseyes;
somewhere beyond hislook ofcourteous sternness, there wasanote
ofhumor, sotaint that itvanished ifone tried todiscern it.
Vhetwoworkers finished, paidanddeparted, each leaving adime
foratip.Shewatched theman asheremoved their dishes, putthe
dimes intothepocket ofhiswhite jacket, wiped thecounter, working
with swift precision. Then heturned andlooked ather Itwasan
impersonal glance, notintended toinvite conversation; butshe felt
certain thathehadlong since noted herNewYork suit, herhigh-
heeled pumps, herairofbeing awoman whodidnotwaste hertime;
hiscold, observant eyesseemed totellherthatheknew shedidnot
belong hereandthathewaswaiting todiscover herpurpose
‘How isbusiness?" sheasked.
‘Pretty bad.They’re going toclose theLennox Foundry nextweek,
so 111have todose soon, loo,andmove on."Hisvoice was clear,
impersonally cordial.
“Where to?"
"Ihaven't decided."
"What sortofthingdoyouhave inmind?"
*1don’t know. Frnthinking otopening agarage, if1canfindthe

"Oh no!You’re toogood atyour jobtochange it.Youshouldn't

Astrange, finesmilemoved thecurve ofhismouth. “No?” he
asked courteously.
“No!Howwould you likeajobinNewYork?" Helooked ather,
astonished. *Tm serious. Icangiveyouajobonabigrailroad, in

"May Iaskwhyyoushould want to?"
She raised thehamburger sandwich initswhite paper napkin.
“There’s oneofthereasons."
“Thank you.What arctheothers?"
"Idon’t suppose you’ve lived inabig city, oryou'd knowhow
miserably difficult itistofindanycompetent men foranyjob

“Iknow alittleabout that"
“Well? How about it,then?Would you likeajob inNewYork at
tenthousand dollars ayear?”
"No”
Shehadbeen carried away bythejoyofdiscovering andrewarding
ability. Shelooked athim silently, shocked. “1don’t thinkyouunder-

"Idid."
"You’re refusing anopportunity ofthiskind?"
"Yes."
"But why**"
“That isapersonal matter.’'
"Why should youwork like this,when youcanhave abettei job?"
"Iamnotlooking forabetter job."
“You don’t want achance toriseandmakemoney?"
"No.Whydoyou insist?"
"Because ihate toseeability being wasted!"
Hesaid slowly, intently, "SodoI."
Something inthewayhosaid itmade her tec!thebond ofsome

thatforbade herever tocallforhelp. "I’m sosickofthem!" Hei
voice startled her. itwasaninvoluntary cry."I’m sohungry forany
sight ofanyone who’s able todowhatever itishe’sdoing’"
Shepressed theback ofherhand tohereyes, trying todam the
outbreak ofadespair shehadnotpermitted herself toacknowledge:
shehadnotknown theextent of it,norhow little ofherendurance
thequest had lefther.
*Tm sorry," hesaid, hisvoice low. Itsounded, notasanapology,
butasastatement ofcompassion.
Sheglanced upathim.Hesmiled, andsheknew thatthesmile was
intended tobreak thebond which he,too,had felt:thesmile had a
trace ofcourteous mockery. Hesaid,"But Idon’t believe thatyou
came allthewayfromNewYork justtohunt forrailroad books in
theRockies."
"No. 1came forsomething else." Sheleaned forward bothforearms
braced firmly against thecounter, feeling calm and intight control
again, sensing adangerous adversary. "Didyouknow, about tenyears
ago,ayoung engineer whoworked fortheTwentieth Century Motor
Company?"
306
Shecounted theseconds ofapause; shecould notdefine thenature
ofthewayhelooked ather.except that itwasthelook ofsome
special attentiveness.
"Yes, Idid," beanswered.
"Could yougivemehisname andaddress?”
"What for?"
"Itscrucially important that 1findhim."
“That man?Ofwhat importance ishe?"
"He isthemost important man intheworld."
"Really? Why?"
"Did youknow anything about hiswork?"
"Yes."
"Did youknow thathehitupon anideaofthemosttremendous

Heletamoment pass. ‘‘May 1askwhoyouare?"
“Dagny Taggart. I’mtheVice-Pres--"
"Yes, Miss Taggart. Iknowwhoyouare."
Hesaid itwithimpersonal deference. Buthelooked asifhehad
found theanswer tosome special question mhismind andwasnot
astonished anylonger.
"Then youknow that rnyinterest isnotkite,” shesaid,"I'm ina

"May 1askwhat hasaroused your interestmhim?"
“His motor."

"Ifound abroken remnant olUmtherums oftheTwentieth

Hehadlistened without moving, looking straight ather;theatten-
tiveness ofhiseyesseemed totake hold ofevery word andstore it
carefully away, giving hern>due tohispurpose. Hedidnotmove
foralong time. Thenhesaid,"Give itup,Miss Taggart. Youwon’t
findhim."
"What ishisname?"
“Ican tellyounothing about him."
“Ishestillalive?"
"Ican tellyounothing."
"What isyourname?”
"Hugh Akston."
Through theblank seconds ofrecapturing hermind, shekept telling
herself: You’re hysterical . . .don’t bepreposterous . . .it’sjusta
coincidence ofnames —while sheknew, incertainty andnumb, inexpli-
cable terror, that thiswastheHugh Akston.
307
“Hugh Akston?” shestammered. “The philosopher? ...The last
oftheadvocates ofreason?”
“Why, yes,” heanswered pleasantly. “Orthe firstoftheir return.”
Hedidnotseem startled byhershock, butheseemed tofind it
unnecessary. Hismanner wassimple, almost friendly, asifhefeltno
need tohide hisidentity andnoresentment atitsbeing discovered.
“Ididn't think thatanyyoung person would recognize myname or
attach anysignificance toit,nowadays,” hesaid.
“But ...butwhat areyoudoing here?” Herarmswept atthe
room. “This doesn’t make sense!”
“Are yousure?”
“What isit?Astunt?Anexperiment? Asecret mission? Areyou
studying something forsome special purpose?”
“No, MissTaggart. I’mearning myliving.” Thewords andthevoice
hadthegenuine simplicity oftruth.
“Dr.Akston, l ...it’sinconceivable, it’s ...You're . ..you're a
philosopher ... thegreatest philosopher living ...animmortal

“Because Iamaphilosopher. Miss Taggart.”
Sheknew withcertainty— even though she feltasifhercapacity
forcertainty andforunderstanding weregone -thatshewould obtain
nohelpfrom him, thatquestions were useless, thathewould giveher
noexplanation: neither oftheinventor’s fatenorofhisown.
“Give itup.Miss Taggart,” hesaid quietly, asifgiving proof that
hecould guess herthoughts, asshehadknown hewould, ‘It isa
hopeless quest, themore hopeless because youhavenoinkling of

isonlyone helpful suggestion that Icangive you:Bytheessence
andnature ofexistence, contradictions cannot exist. Ifyou find it
inconceivable thataninvention ofgenius should beabandoned among
ruins, and thataphilosopher should wish towork asacook ina
diner—check your premises. You willfindthatoneofthem iswrong.”
She started: sheremembered thatshehadheard thisbefore and
that itwasFrancisco whohadsaid it.Andthensheremembered that
thismanhadbeenoneofFrancisco's teachers.
“Asyouwish.DrAkston,” shesaid. “1won’t attempt toquestion
youabout it.Butwould youpermit metoaskyouaquesliod onan
entirely different subject?”
“Certainly.”
“Dr.Robert Stadler once toldmethatwhenyouwere atthePatrick
Henry University, youhadthree students whowere your favorites
308
and his,three brilliant minds fromwhom youexpected agreat future.
One ofthemwasFrancisco d’Anconia.”
“Yes. Another wasRagnar DanneskjOld/’
“Incidentally —this isnotmyquestion—whowasthethird?”
“Hisname would mean nothing toyou.He isnotfamous.”
“Dr. Stadler saidthatyouandhewere rivals over these three stu-
dents, because youboth regarded them asyour sons.”
“Rivals? Helostthem.”
“Tell me,areyouproud ofthewaythese three have turned out?”
Helooked off,intothedistance, atthedying fireofthesunset on
theiarthest rocks; hisfacehadthelookofafatherwhowatches his
sonsbleeding onabattlefield. Heanswered:
“More proud than Ihadeverhoped tobe.”
Itwasalmost dark.Heturned sharply, took apackage ofcigarettes
from hispocket, pulled outone cigarette, butstopped, remembering
herpresence, asifhehadforgotten itforamoment, andextended
thepackage toher.Shetook acigarette andhestruck thebrief flare
ofamatch, thenshook itout.leaving onlytwosmall points offirein

She rose, paidher bill,and said,“Thank you. Dr.Akston. Iwill
notmolest youwith tricks orpleas. 1willnothire detectives. But 1
think Ishould tellyouthat Iwillnotgive up. 1must findtheinventor
ofthatmotor. 1willfindhim."
‘Not until thedaywhen hechooses tofindyou— ashewill.”
When shewalked tohercar,heswitched onthelights inthediner,
shesawthemailbox bythesideoftheroadandnoted theincredible
fact thatthename“Hugh Akston” stood written openly across if
Shehaddriven fardown thewinding road, andthelights ofthe
diner were long since outofsight, when shenoticed thatshewas
enjoying thetaste ofthecigarette hehadgiven her: itwasdifferent
fromanyshehadeversmoked before. Sheheldthesmall remnant to
thelight ofthedashboard, looking forthename ofthebrand. There
wasnoname, only atrademark. Stamped ingoldonthethin, white
paper there stood thesign ofthedollar.
Sheexamined itcuriously: shehadnever heard ofthatbrand before.
Then sheremembered theoldman atthecigar stand oftheTaggart
Terminal, andsmiled, thinking that thiswasaspecimen forhiscollec-
tion.Shestamped outthe fireanddropped thebuttintoherhandbag.
TrainNumber 57was lined along thetrack, ready toleave for
Wyatt Junction, when shereached Cheyenne, lefthercaratthegarage
where shehadrented it,andwalked outontheplatform oftheTag-
gart station. Shehad halfanhour towait fortheeast-bound main
liner toNewYork. Shewalked totheendoftheplatform andleaned
wearily against alamppost; shedidnotwant tobeseenandrecognized
bythestation employees, shedidnotwant totalk toanyone, she
needed rest.Afewpeople stood industers onthehalf-deserted plat-
form; animated conversations seemed tobegoing on,andnewspapers
weremore prominently inevidence than usual.
Shelooked atthelighted windows ofTrainNumber 57—foramo-
ment’s relief inthesight ofavictorious achievement TrainNumber
57wasabout tostartdown thetrack oftheJohn Galt Line, through
309
thetown* through thecurves ofthemountains, pastthegreen signals
where people hadstood cheering andthevalleys where rockets had
risen tothesummer sky.Twisted remnants ofleaves nowhungon

fursandmufflers, astheyclimbed aboard. Theymoved withthecasual
manner ofadaily event, with thesecurity ofexpecting aperformance
long since taken forgranted. . . .We've done it—shethought—this
much, atleast, isdone.
Itwasthechance conversation oftwomensomewhere behind her
thatcame beating suddenly against herclosed attention.
“But lawsshouldn’t bepassed thatway,soquickly.”
‘•They’re notlaws, theyVe directives."
'Then it'sillegal."
“It's not illegal, because theLegislature passed alaw lastmonth

“Idon't think directives should besprung onpeople thatway, out

“But Idon’t think it’srightand itdoesn't jibe.How isReardon

"Why should youworry about Reardon’He’snehenough. Hecan

Chapter 1THEMANWHOBELONGED ONEARTH
Dr.Robert Startler paced hisoffice, wishing hewould not feelthe
cold.
Spring hadbeen late incoming. Beyond thewindow, thedead
gray ofthe hillslooked likethesmeared transition from thesoiled
while oftheskytotheleaden black oftheriver.Once inawhile,
adistant patch ofhillside flared into asilver-yellow thatwasalmost
green, then vanished. Theclouds kept cracking foithewidth ofa
single sunray, thenoozing dosed again. Itwasnotcold intheoffice,
thought DrSladler, itwas thatview thatfroze theplace.
Itwasnotcold today, thechillwas inhisbones -hethought'— the
stored accumulation ofthewinter months, when hehadhadtobe
distracted from hiswork byanawareness ofsuch amatter asinade-
quate heating andpeople hadtalked about conserving fuel llwas
preposterous, hethought, thisgrowing intrusion oftheaccidents of
nature into theaffairs ofmen: tthadnever mattered before, ifa
winter happened tobeunusually severe; ifaflood washed outa
section ofrailroad track, onedidnotspend twoweeks eating canned
\egetables; ifanelectric storm struck somepower station, anestab-
lishment such astheSlate Science Institute was not leftwithout
electricity forfivedays. Fivedays ofstillness thiswinter, hethought,
with thegreat laboratory motors slopped and irretrievable hours
wiped out,when hisstaffhadbeen working onproblems that in-
volved theheart oftheuniverse. Heturned angrily away from the
window- -butstopped andturned back toitagain. Hedidnotwant
toseethebook that layonhisdesk.
Hewished Dr.Ferris would come. Heglanced athiswatch: Dr.
Fen iswaslate— anastonishing matter— lateforanappointment with
him-Dr, Floyd Ferris, thevalet ofscience, whohadalways faced
him inamanner thatsuggested anapology forhaving butonehat
totake oft
lTiiswasoutrageous weather forthemonth ofMay. hethought,
looking down atthe river; itwas certainly theweather thatmade
him feelashedid,notthebook.Hehadplaced thebook inplain
viewonhisdesk,when hehadnoted that hisreluctance tosee it
wasmore thanmere revulsion, that itcontained theelement ofan
emotion never tobeadmitted, Hetoldhimself thathehad risen
315
from hisdesk, notbecause thebook laythere, butmerely because
hehadwanted tomove, feeling cold.Hepaced theroom, trapped
between thedeskandthewindow. Hewould throw thatbook inthe
ashcanwhere itbelonged, hethought, justassoon ashehadspoken
toDr.Ferris.
Hewatched thepatch ofgreen andsunlight onthedistant hill,
thepromise ofspring inaworld thatlooked asifnograss orbud
would ever function again.Hesmiled eagerly— andwhen thepatch
vanished, hefeltastabofhumiliation, athisowneagerness, atthe
desperate wayhehadwanted tohold it.Itreminded himofthat
interview with theeminent novelist, lastwinter. The novelist had
come fromEurope towrite anarticle about him—and he,whohad
once despised interviews, hadtalked eagerly, lengthily, toolengthily,
seeing apromise ofintelligence inthenovelist's face, feeling acause-
less,desperate need tobeunderstood. The article hadcome outas
acollection ofsentences thatgave hintexorbitant praise andgarbled
every thought hehadexpressed, (losing themagazine, hehad felt
what hewas feeling now atthedesertion ofasunray.
Allright—hethought, turning away from thewindow— hewould
concede thatattacks ofloneliness hadbegun tostrike him attimes;
but itwasaloneliness towhich hewas entitled, itwashunger lor
theresponse ofsome living, thinking mind.Hewassotired ofall
those people, hethought incontemptuous bitterness; hedealt with
cosmic rays, while theywere unable todeal withanelectric storm.
He feltthesudden contraction ofhismouth, likeaslapdenying
him theright topursue thiscourse ofthought. Hewaslooking at
thebook onhisdesk. Itsglossy jacket wasglaring andnew; ithad
been published twoweeks ago.But Ihadnothing todowith it’—
hescreamed tohimself; thescream seemed wasted onamerciless
silence; nothing answered it,noecho offorgiveness. The titleonthe
book's jacket wasWhyDoYouHunk YouThink?
There wasnosound inthatcourtroom silence within him,nopity,
novoice <}fdefense —nothing buttheparagraphs which hisgreat
memory hadreprinted onhisbrain:
“Thought isaprimitive superstition. Reason isanirrational idea.
The childish notion thatweareable tothink hasbeen mankind's
costliest error.’’
“What youthink youthink isanillusion created byyour glands,
your emotions and, inthe last analysis, bythecontent ofyour
stomach."
“That graymatter you’re soproud ofislikeamirror inanamuse-
ment parkwhich transmits toyounothing butdistorted signals from
areality forever beyond your grasp,"
"Themore certain you feelofyour rational conclusions, themore
certain you aretobewrong. Your brain being aninstrument of
distortion, themore active thebrain thegreater thedistortion."
“The giants ofthe intellect, whom youadmire so$nuch, once
taught youthattheearth wasHatandthattheatomwasthesmallest
particle ofmatter. The entire history ofscience isaprogression of
exploded fallacies, notofachievements."
“Themoreweknow, themorewelearn thatweknow nothing."
316
“Only thecrassest ignoramus can stillhold totheold-fashioned
notion thatseeing isbelieving. Thatwhich yousee isthe firstthing
todisbelieve."
“Ascientist knows thatastone isnotastone atall. Itis,infact,
identical with afeather pillow. Both areonlyacloud formation of
thesame invisible, whirling particles. But,you say,youcan’t usea
stone forapillow? Well, thatmerely proves your helplessness inthe
faceofactual reality.”
“The latest scientific discoveries—such asthetremendous achieve-
ments ofDr.Robert Stadler— have demonstrated conclusively that
ourreason isincapable ofdealing with thenature oftheuniverse.
These discoveries have ledscientists tocontradictions which areim-
possible, according tothehuman mind, butwhich exist inreality
nonetheless. Ifyouhave notyetheard it,mydear old-fashioned
friends, ithasnowbeen proved thattherational istheinsane.”
“Donotexpect consistency. Everything isacontradiction ofevery-
thing else.Nothing exists butcontradictions.”
“Do notlook for‘common sense.’ Todemand 'sense' isthehall-
mark ofnonsense. Natures does notmake sense. Nothing makes
sense. Theonlycrusaders forsense’ arethestudious typeofadoles-
cent oldmaidwho can’t find aboy friend, andtheold-fashioned
shopkeeper whothinks thattheuniverse isassimple ashisneat little
inventory andbeloved cash register.”
“Let usbreak thechains oftheprejudice oalled Logic. Arewe
going tobestopped byasyllogism?”
“Soyouthink you’re sure ofyour opinions? Youcannot besure
ofanything. Areyougoing toendanger theharmony ofyourcommu-
nity,your fellowship withyour neighbors, your standing, reputation,
goodname and financial security—forthesake ofanillusion? For
thesake ofthemirage ofthinking thatyouthink? Areyougoing to
run risks andcourt disasters -ataprecarious time likeours— -by
opposing theexisting social order inthename ofthose imaginary
notions ofyours which you callyour convictions? Yousaythatyou’re
sureyou’re right? Nobody isright, orevercanbe.You feelthatthe
world around you iswrong? Youhavenomeans toknow it.Every-
thing iswrong inhuman eyes— sowhy fight it?Don’t argue. Accept.
Adjust yourself. Obey.”
fhcbook waswritten byDrFloyd Ferris andpublished bythe
State Science Institute.
“1hadnothing todowith it!”said Dr,Robert Stadler. Hestood
stillbythesideofhisdesk, with theuncomfortable feeling ofhaving
missed some beatoftime, ofnotknowing howlong thepreceding
moment had lasted. Hehadpronounced thewords aloud, inatone
ofrancorous sarcasm directed atwhoever hadmade himsay it.
Heshrugged Resting onthebelief thatself-mockery isanactof
virtue, theshrug was theemotional equivalent ofthesentence:
You’re Robert Stadler, don't actlikeahigh-school neurotic. Hesat
down athisdeskandpushed thebook aside with theback ofhis
hand.
Dr.'Floyd Ferris arrived halfanhour late.“Sorry,” hesaid,“but
mycarbroke down again onthewayfromWashington and Ihada

There wasmore annoyance thanapology inhisvoice.Hesatdown

Dr.Floyd Ferris would nothavebeen noticed asparticularly hand-
some inanyother profession, butintheonehehadchosen hewas
always described as“that good-looking scientist/’ Hewas sixfeet

astheTop C'o-otdinator oftheState Science Institute.
Dr.Sladler glanced athimwithastonishment -the lack otapology
wasunprecedented —and said drylv, “Itseems tomethatyouare
spending agteal dealofyour time inWashington"
“But, Dr.Sladler. wasn't ityouwhoonce paidmethecompliment

antly “Isn't thatmymost essential duty?”
“Alew ot\our duties seem tobeaccumulating rightaiound this

“What areyoutalking about?” asked DrSladler
"The Wvatt Reclamation Project. Isn’t thatwhatyouaskedmcr
"No,” said Dr.Stadler. “no. I , .Wait amoment. Ketmegel
this straight. 1seem torecall something about this Institute taking
charge ofareclamation project. What isnthatyou're reclaiming?”
"Oil,” saidDrFerris. “The Wyatt oilfields”
“That wasalire,wasn't it?InColorado? Ihatwasy. .wait a

318
“Well* whoowns those fieldsnow?”
“Nobody—atthemoment. There being nowillorheirs, thegov-
ernment hastaken charge ofoperating thefields—asameasure of
public necessity—forseven years. IfEllisWyatt does notreturn
within thattime, hewillbeconsidered officially dead.”
“Well, why didtheycome toyou—tous,forsuch anunlikely
assignment asoilpumping?"
“because itisaproblem ofgreat technological difficulty, requiring
theservices ofthebest scientific talent available. You see, itisa
matter ofreconstructing thespecial method ofoilextraction that
Wyatt hademployed. Hisequipment isstillthere, though inadread-
fulcondition; some ofhisprocesses areknown, butsomehow there
isnofullrecord ofthecomplete operation orthebasic principle
involved. That iswhatwehave torediscover.”
“Andhow isitgoing?"
“The progress ismost gratifying. Wehave justbeen granted anew
and larger appropriation. Mr.Wesley Mouch ispleased withour
work. SoareMr.Balch oftheEmergency Commission, Mr.Ander-
sonofCrucial Supplies andMr.Pettibone ofConsumers' Protection.
Idonotseewhatmore could beexpected ofus.Theproject is
fully successful."
"Have youproduced anyoil?"
“No, butwehave succeeded inforcing a(lowfrom oneofthe
wells, totheextent ofsixandahalfgallons, This,ofcourse, ismerely
ofexperimental significance, butyoumust take intoconsideration
Ihefact thatwehadtospend three fullmonths justtoputoutthe
lire,which hasr.owbeen totally— almost totally— extinguished. We
have amuch tougher problem thanWyatt ever had, because he
started from scratch whilewehave todeal withthedisfigured wreck-
ageofanactofvicious, anti-social sabotage which . .1mean to
say, itisadifficult problem, butthere isnodoubt thatwewillbe
able tosolve it."
"Well, what 1really asked youabout wasthe oilshortage here,
intheInstitute. The level oftemperature maintained inthisbuilding
allwinter wasoutrageous. They toldmethattheyhad toconserve
oil.Surely youcould have seen to itthat thematter ofkeeping
thisplace adequately supplied with such things asoilwashandled
more efficiently."
"Oh, isthatwhatyouhad inmind. Dr,Stadlcr? Oh,but 1amso
sorry!" Thewords came with abright smile ofrelief onDr.Ferris’
face; hissolicitous manner returned. "Doyoumean thatthetemper-
aturewaslowenough tocause youdiscomfort?"
"Imean that Inearly froze todeath."
Butthat isunforgivable! Why didn’t they tellme? Please accept
mypersonal apology. Dr.Stadlcr, and restassured thatyou will
never beinconvenienced again. Theonlyexcuse !canoffer forour
maintenance department isthattheshortage offuelwasnotdue to
their negligence, itwas -*oh, 1realize thatyouwould notknow about
•Iandsuch matters should nottakeupyour invaluable attention—
hut,you see,theoilshortage lastwinter wasanationwide crisis."
319
“Why? Forheaven's sake, don’t tellmethatthose Wyatt fields
were theonlysource ofoilinthecountry?”
"No. no.hutthesudden disappearance ofamajor supply wrought
havoc intheenliie oilmaiket, Sothegovernment hadtoassume
control andimpose oilrationing onthecountry, inorder toptotecl

“Isee.Well, Itrust thatyou willtake care oi itamong allyour
other activities.” DrStadlei shrugged withannoyance "It isbecom-
ingalittle ridiculous— thenunthci ottechnological ventures thatan
institution ofscience hastohandle forthegovernment."
"But, Dr.Stadler—"
"Iknow. Iknow itcan’t beavoided. Bytheway,what isProj-
ectX?"
Dr.Ferris' eyes shot tohim swiftly- -anodd, bright glance o(aleit-
ness, thatseemed startled, butnotfrightened. “Where didyouhcai
about Project X.DrStadler?"
“Oh, Iheard acouple ofvour younger boys saying something
about itwithanairofmystery you'd expect fromamateur detectives
TTiey toldme itwassomething very secret/'
"That's right, Dr.Stadler. Itisanextremely secret lesearch project

tance thatthenewspapers getnoword about it."
“What's theXr*
“Xylophone. Project Xylophone That isaaxlename, ofcourse.

“Yes, dosparemethestory. Ihavenotime foryour technologi-

“May Isuggest that itwould beadvisable torefrain frommen

“Oh, allright, allright. Imust say ldonotenjoy discussions of

“But ofcourse! And Iwouldn’t forgive myself if Iallowed your

thiswasthereason youwanted toseemeplease believe /that I--"
“No," saidDr.Stadler slowly. “This wasnotthereason Iwanted
toseeyou."
Dr.Ferris volunteered noquestions, noeager offers ofService; he
remained seated, merely waiting.
320
Dr.Stadler reached overandmade thehook slidefrom thecomer
tothecenter ofhisdesk, with acontemptuous flickofonehand.
“Will you tellme,please,” heasked, “what isthispiece ofin-
decency?”
Dr.Ferris didnotglance atthebook, butkept hiseyes fixedon
Siadler’s foraninexplicable moment; thenheleaned backandsaid
withanodd smile, “1feelhonored thatyouchose tomake suchan
exception formysake asreading apopular book, litis little piece
hassoldtwenty thousand copies intwoweeks.”
“1have read it.”
“And?”
“Iexpect anexplanation.”
“DidyouAndthetextcontusing?”
Dr.Stadler looked athim inbewilderment. “Doyou realize what
theme youchose totreatand inwhatmanner? The style alone, the
style, thegutter kindofattitude—forasubject ofthisnature!”
“Doyouthink, then, thatthecontent deserved amore dignified
form ofpresentation?” Thevoice wassoinnocently smooth thatDr.
Stadler could notdecide whether thiswasmockery.
“Doyou realize what you're preaching inthisbook?”
“Since youdonotseem toapprove of it.Dr.Stadler, I'drather
haveyouthink that 1wrote itinnocently.”
Thiswas it,thought Dr.Stadler, thiswastheincomprehensible
element inFerris" manner: hehadsupposed thatanindication ofhis
disapproval would besulticicnt, butFerris seemed turemain un-
touched by it.
“Ifadrunken loutcould findthepower toexpress himself on
paper,” saidDr.Stadler. “ifhecould givevoice tohisessence—the
eternal savage, leering hishatred ofthemind- -this isthesortof
book Iwould expect himtowrite. Huttosee itcome from ascientist,
under theimprint ofthis Institute!”
“But, Dr.Stadler. thisbook wasnotintended tobereadbyscien-
tists. Itwaswritten forthatdrunken lout.”
“What doyoumean?”
“For thegenet alpublic.”
“But, goodGod!The feeblest imbecile should beable toseethe
dlaring contradictions inevery oneofyour statements.”
“Let usput itthisway.DrStadler. Themanwho doesn't see
that,deserves tobelieve allmystatements.”
“But you've given theprestige ofscience tothatunspeakable stuff!
Itwas allright foradisreputable mediocrity likeSimon Pritchett to
drool itassome sortofwoozy mysticism—nobody listened tohim.
Butyou’ve made them think il*sscience. Science! You’ve taken the
achievements ofthemind todestroy themind. Bywhat right did
youusemywork tomake anunwarranted, preposterous switch into
another field, pullaninapplicable metaphor anddraw amonstrous
generalization outofwhat ismerely amathematical problem? By
what right didyoumake itsound asifI—//—gave mysanction to
thatbook?”
Dr.Ferris didnothing, hemerely looked atDr.Stadler calmly;
hutthecalm gavehimanairthatwasalmost patronizing. “Now,
321
yousee,Dr.Stadler, you’re speaking asifthisbook were addressed
toathinking audience. Ifitwere, onewould have tobeconcerned
with such matters asaccuracy, validity, logic andtheprestige of
science. But itisn’t. It’saddressed tothepublic. Andyouhaveah
waysbeen firsttobelieve thatthepublic doesnotthink.” Hepaused,
butDr.Stadler saidnothing. “This bookmayhavenophilosophical
value whatever, but ithasagreat psychological value.”
‘'Just what isthat?”
‘You see.Dr.Stadler, people don’t want tothink.And thedeeper
they getinto trouble, thelesstheywant tothink. Butbysome sort
ofinstinct, they feelthattheyought toand itmakes them feel guilty.
Sothey'll blessandfollow anyone who givesthem ajustification for
notthinking. Anyone whomakes avirtue—ahighly intellectual vir-
tue—outofwhat theyknow tobetheir sin, their weakness and
their guilt.”
“And youpropose topander tothat?”
'That istheroad topopularity.”
“Why should youseek popularity?”
Dr.Ferris' eyesmoved casually toDr.Sladler’s face, asifbypure
accident. “We areapublic institution,” heanswered evenly, “sup-
ported bypublic funds.”
“Soyou tellpeople thatscience isafutile fraud which ought to
beabolished!”
“That isaconclusion which could bedrawn, inlogic, fromm\
book. Butthat isnottheconclusion they willdraw.”
“And what about thedisgrace totheInstitute intheeyes ofthe
men ofintelligence, wherever suchmaybeleft?”
“Why should weworry about them?”
Dr.Stadler could have regarded thesentence asconceivable, had
itbeen uttered with hatred, envy ormalice; buttheabsence ofany
such emotion, thecasual ease ofthevoice, anease suggesting a
chuckle, hithim likeamoment’s glimpse ofaicalm thatcould not
betaken aspartofreality; thething spreading down tohisstomach
wascold terror.
‘•Did youobserve thereactions tomybook. Dr.Stadia? Itwas
received withconsiderable favor.”
“Yes—andthat iswhat Ifindimpossible tobelieve.” Hehad to
speak, hehadtospeak asifthiswere acivilized discussion, hecould
notallow himself time toknow what itwashehad feltforamoment
“1amunable tounderstand theattention votireceived inallthe
reputable academic magazines andhowtheycould permit themselves
todiscuss yourbook seriously. IfHugh Akston were around, no
academic publication would havedared totreat thisasawork admis-
sible intotherealm ofphilosophy.”
“He isnotaround.”
Dr.Stadler feltthat there were words which hewas
Jnow called
upon topronounce—andhewished hecould end thisconversation
before hediscovered what theywere.
“On theother hand,” saidDr.Ferris, “theadsformj£book— oh,
Tmsureyouwouldn’t notice such things asads—quotd aletter of
high praise which Ireceived from Mr,Wesley Mouch.”
322
“Who thehell isMr.Wesley Mouch?”
Dr.Ferris smiled. “Inanother yearevenyouwon’t askthatques-
tion,Dr.Stadler. Letusput itthisway:Mr,Mouch isthemanwho
isrationing oil—forthetime being.”
“Then 1suggest thatyou stick toyour job.Deal withMr.Mouch
andleavehimtherealm ofoilfurnaces, butleave therealm ofideas
tome.”
“!twould becurious totrytoformulate thelineofdemarcation,”
saidDr.Ferris, inthetoneofanidleacademic remark. “But ifwe’re
talking aboutmyhook, why, then we’re talking about therealm of
public relations.” Heturned topoint solicitously atthemathematical
formulas chalked ontheblackboard. “Dr. Stadler, itwould bedisas-
trous ifyouallowed therealm ofpublic relations todistract you
from thework which youalone onearth arecapable ofdoing.”
Itwassaidwithobsequious deference, andDr.Stadler could not
tellwhatmade himhear initthesentence. “Slick toyour black-
board!” Hefeltabiting irritation andheswitched itagainst himself,
thinking angrily thathehadtogetridofthese suspicions.
“Public relations?” hesaidcontemptuously. “1don’t seeanyprac-
ticalpurpose inyourbook. Idon't seewhat it’sintended toaccom-
plish.”
“Don’t you?” Dr.Fen is*eyes flickered briefly tohisface; the
sparkle ofinsolence wastooswift tobeidentified with certainty.
”1cannot permit myself toconsider certain things aspossible in
acivilized society,” DrStadler said sternly.
“That isadmirably exact.” saidDr.Perris cheerfully. “You cannot
permit yourself.”
Dr.Ferris rose,being firsttoindicate thattheinterview wasended.
“Please callformewhenever anything occurs inthis Institute to
cause youdiscomfort. Dr.Stadler,” hesaid. “It ismyprivilege always
tobeatyour service,”
Knowing thathehadtoassert hisauthority, smothering theshame-
fulrealization ofthesortofsubstitute hewaschoosing. Dr.Stadler
saidimperiously, inatone ofsarcastic rudeness, “The nexttime 1
callforyou,you’d better dosomething about thatcarofyours.”
“Yes. Dr.Stadler, Ishallmake certain never tobelateagain, and
lbegyou toforgive me.” Dr.Ferris responded asifplaying apari
oncue; asifhewere pleased thatDr.Stadler hadlearned, atlast,
themodern method olcommunication. “My carhasbeen causing
meagreat deal oftrouble, it’sfalling topieces, and 1hadordered
anewonesome time ago. thebestoneonthemarket, aHammond
convertible —but Lawrence Hammond went outofbusiness last
week, without reason orwarning, sonowI’mstuck. Those bastards
seem tobevanishing somewhere. Something willhave tobedone
about it.”
When Ferris hadgone, Dr.Stadler satathisdesk, hisshoulders
shrinking together, conscious onlyofadesperate wish nottobeseen
byanyone. Inthefogofthepainwhich hewould notdefine, there
*asalso thedesperate feeling thatnoone—nooneofthose he
valued— would everwish tosechim again.
Heknew thewords which hehadnotuttered. Hehadnotsaid
323
thathewould denounce thebook inpublic andrepudiate itinthe
name oftheinstitute. Hehadnotsaid it,because hehadbeen afraid
todiscover thatthethreat would leave Ferris unmoved, that Ferris
was safe, that theword ofDr.Robert Stadter hadnopower any
longer. And while hetoldhimself thathewould consider later the
question ofmaking apublic protest, heknew thathewould not
make it.
Hepicked upthebook and let itdrop intothewastebasket

Sheknew what steps would come next: first, thedeath ofthe

Ithad lasted lessthan sixmonths after EllisWyatt ladgone—
thatperiod which acolumnist hadgleefully called‘thefielddayof
324
the little fellow.” Every oiloperator inthecountry, whoowned three
wellsandwhined that EllisWyatt lefthimnochance oflivelihood,
hadrushed to filltheholewhich Wyatt had leftwide open. They
formed leagues, cooperatives, associations; they pooled their re-
sources and their letterheads. “The little fellow’s dayinthesun,”
thecolumnist had said.Their sunhadbeen theflames thattwisted
through thederricks otWyatt Oil.Initsglare, theymade thekind
offortunes theyhaddreamed about, fortunes requiring nocompe-
tence oreffort. Then their biggest customers, such aspower compa-
nies,whodrank oilbythetrainful andwould make noallowances
forhuman frailty, began toconvert tocoal—andthesmaller custom-
ers,whoweremore tolerant, began togooutofbusiness— theboys
inWashington imposed rationing onoilandanemergency taxon

sundiscovered that adrilling bitwhich hadcostahundred dollars,

were granted permission toraise their freight rates, there being little

small linesoutofexistence—andwhen thesunwentdown, theysaw
thattheoperating costs, which hadonce permitted them toexiston
their sixty-acre fields, hadbeenmade possible bythemiles ofWyatt’s
hillside andhadgone inthesame coils ofsmoke. Not until their
fortunes hadvanished andtheirpumps hadstopped, didthe little
fellows realize thatnobusiness inthecountry could afford tobuy
mlattheprice itwould nowlakethem toproduce it.Then theboys
inWashington granted subsidies totheoiloperators, butnot allof
the oiloperators hadfriends inWashington, andthere followed a
situation which noonecared toexamine tooclosely ortodiscuss.
Andrew Stockton hadbeenmthesortofposition which most of
thebusinessmen envied. Therush toconvert tocoalhaddescended
upon hisshoulders likeaweight ofgold hehadkept hisplantwork-
ingaround theclock, running arace with next winter’s blizzards,
casting parts forcoal-burning stoves andfurnaces. There were not
many dependable foundries left;hehadbecome oneofthemain
pillars supporting thecellars andkitchens ofthecountry. The pillar
collapsed without warning. Andrew Stockton announced thathewas
retiring, closed hisplant andvanished. Heleftnowordonwhat he
wished tobedone with theplant orwhether hisrelatives hadthe
right toreopen it.
There stillwere carsontheroads ofthecountry, buttheymoved
bketravelers inthedesert, who ridepast thewarning skeletons of
horses bleached bythesun:theymoved pasttheskeletons ofcars
thathadcollapsed ondutyandhadbeen left intheditches bythe
Mdeoftheroad. People were notbuying carsanylonger, andthe
automobile factories were closing. Butthere weremen stillable to
getoil,'bymeans offriendships thatnobody cared toquestion. These
menbought cars atanypricedemanded. Lights flooded themoun-
325
tains ofColorado from thegreat windows oftheplant, where the
assembly belts ofLawrence Hammond poured trucks andcars to
thesidings ofTaggart Transcontinental. Theword thatLawrence
Hammond hadretired camewhen least expected, briefandsudden
likethesingle stroke ofabell inaheavy stillness. Acommittee of
local citizens wasnow broadcasting appeals ontheradio, begging
Lawrence Hammond, wherever hewas, togivethem permission to
reopen hisplant. There wasnoanswer.
Shehadscreamed when EllisWyatt went; shehadgasped when
Andrew Stockton retired; when sheheard thatLawrence Hammond
had quit, sheasked impassively, “Who's next?”
“No, MissTaggart, lcan’t explain it,”thesister ofAndrew Stock-
tonhadtoldheronher last triptoColorado, twomonths ago.“He
never saidaword tomeand 1don't evenknow whether he’sdead
orliving, same asEllisWyatt. No,nothing special hadhappened the
daybefore hequit. 1remember only thatsomemancame tosee
himonthat lastevening. Astranger I’dnever seen before. They
talked lateintothenight— when lwent tosleep, the lightwas still
burning inAndrew's study”
People were silent inthetowns ofColorado. Dagny hadseen the
waytheywalked inthestreets, past their small drugstores, hardware
stores andgrocery markets: asiftheyhoped that themotions ot
their jobswould savethem from looking ahead atthefuture She.
too,hadwalked through those streets, trying notto liftherhead,

distance.
One well. .onthecrest ofthe hill,was stillburning. Nobody had
been able toextinguish it.Shehadseen itfrom thesheets- aspurt

Shehadseen itatnight, across thedistance otahundred clear, black

Ittook every scrap ofherenergy tokeep trains running through
thesections where theywere stillneeded, intheareas thatwere still
producing. Butonthebalance sheets ofTaggart Transcontinental,
thechecks ofJim’s subsidies forempty trains bore larger figures
326
than theprofit brought bythebest freight train ofthebusiest indus-
trial division.
Jimboasted that thishadbeen themost prosperous sixmonths in
Taggart history. Listed asprofit, ontheglossy pages ofhisreport to
thestockholders, wasthemoney hehadnotearned— thesubsidies
forempty trains; andthemoney hedidnotown— thesums that
should havegone topaytheinterest andtheretirement ofTaggart

permitted nottopay.Heboasted about thegreater volume offreight
carried byTaggart trains inArizona—whereDanConway hadclosed

where PaulLarkin wasshipping ironorebyrail,andthelastofthe
oreboats ontheGreat Lakes hadgone outofexistence.
‘'You havealways considered money-making assuchanimportant

tomethatPmbetter at itthanyouare.”
Nobody professed tounderstand thequestion ofthefrozen rail-
road bonds; perhaps, because everybody understood ittoowell.At
first, there hadbeen signs ofapanicamong thebondholders andof
adangerous indignation among thepublic. Then, Wesley Mouch had
issued another directive, which ruled thatpeople could gettheir
bonds “defrozen” upon apleaof“essential need”: thegovernment
would purchase thebonds, ifitfound theproof oftheneed satisfac-
tory.There were three questions thatnooneanswered orasked:
“What constituted proof?” “What constituted need?” “Essential—
towhom?”
1hen itbecame badmanners todiscuss whyonemanreceived the
grant defreezing hismoney, while another hadbeen refused. People
turned away inmouth-pinched silence, ifanybody asked a“why?”
Onewassupposed todescribe, nottoexplain, tocatalogue facts, not

thatwas all.Andwhen Mr.Jones committed suicide, people said,
'Well, ldon't know, ifhe’d really needed hismoney, thegovernment

Rcarden read itandglanced upatthesuperintendent ofhismills
whostood before himwithout moving. Thesuperintendent hadcome
inandputtheorderdown onhisdesk without aword.
“1thought you'd want tosee it,”hesaid, inanswer toRear-

Reardon pressed abutton, summoning Miss Ives.Hehanded the

Gwen Ivesandthesuperintendent looked athim. ateach other
andback athimagain, what hesaw intheir eyeswascongratulation.
"Yes,MrRearden,” Gwen Ives said formally, taking theslipas
ifitwere anyother kind ofbusiness paper Shebowed and leftthe
room. Ihesuperintendent followed.
Rearden smiled faintly, ingreeting towhat they felt.Hefeltnoth-
ingabout thatpaper oritspossible consequences.
Byasortofinner convulsion— which hadbeen liketearing aplug
outtocutoffthecurrent ofhisemotions—hehadtoldhimself six
months ago.Act first,keep themills going, feel later, ithadmade
himabletowatch dispassionately theworking oftheFairShare Law.
Nobody hadknown how thatlawwastobeobserved. First, he
hadbeen told thathecould notpriKluce Rearden Metal inan
amount greater than thetonnage ofthebest special alloy, other than
steel, produced byOrren Boyle ButOrren Boyle's bestspecial alloy
wassome cracking mixture thatnoonecared tobuy.Then hehad
been toldthathecould produce Rcarden Metal intheamount that
Orren Boyle could have produced, ifhecould have produced it.
Nobody hadknown how thiswas tobedetermined. Somebody in
Washington hadannounced afigure, naming anumber oftonsper
year, giving noreasons. Everybody had lei itgoatthat
Hehadnotknown how togiveevery consumer whodemanded it
anequal share ofRcarden Metal. Thewaiting listoforders could
notbefilled inthree years, evenhadhebeen permitted towork at
fullcapacity. New orders werecoming indaily. Theywere notorders
imylonger, intheold.honorable sense oftrade; theyweredemands.
Thelawprovided thathecould besuedbyanyconsumer who failed
toreceive hisfairshare ofRearden Metal.
Nobody hadknown how todetermine what constituted afairshare
335
ofwhat amount. Then abright young boyjustoutofcollege had
been senttohimfrom Washington, asDeputy Director ofDistribu-
tion. Aftermany telephone conferences with thecapital, theboy
announced thatcustomers would gelfivehundred tonsoftheMetal
each, intheorder ofthedates oftheir applications. Nobody had
argued against hisfigure. There wasnoway toform anargument;
thefigure could havebeenonepound oronemillion tons, with the
same validity. Theboyhadestablished anoffice attheReardcn mills,
where four girlstook applications forshares ofReardcn Metal. At
thepresent rateofthemills’ production, theapplications extended
well intothenext century.
Fivehundred tonsofRearden Metal could notprovide three miles
ofrailforTaggart Transcontinental: itcould notprovide thebracing
foroneofKenDanagger’s coalmines. The largest industries. Rear-
den's bestcustomers, weredenied theuseofhisMetal. Butgolfclubs
made ofRearden Metal were suddenly appearing onthemarket, as
well ascoffee pots,garden toolsandbathroom faucets. KenDanag-
ger,whohadseen thevalue oftheMetal andhaddared toorder it
against afuryofpublic opinion, wasnotpermitted toobtain it:his
order hadbeen left unfilled, cutoffwithout warning hvthenew
laws. Mr.Mowen, whohadbetrayed Taggart Transcontinental inits
most dangerous hour, wasnowmaking switches ofRearden Metal
and selling them totheAtlantic Southern. Rearden looked on,his
emotions plugged out.
Heturned away, without aword,when anybody mentioned tohim
whateverybody knew; thequick fortunes thatwere beingmade on
Rearden Metal. “Well, no," people said indrawing rooms, “you
mustn’t call itblack market, because itisn’t, really. Nobody isselling
theMetal illegally. They’re just selling their right toit.Not selling
really, justpooling their shares.” Hedidnotwant toknow theinsect
intricacy ofthedeals, through which the“shares” were soldand
pooled—norhow amanufacturer inVirginia hadproduced, intwo
months, fivethousand tonsofcastings made ofRearden Metal—nor
whatman inWashington was thatmanufacturer’s unlisted partner.
Heknew that their profit onatonofRearden Metal was fivetimes
larger than hisown.Hesaidnothing. Everybody hadaright tothe
Metal, except himself.
Theyoung boyfrom Washington —whom thesteelworkers had
nicknamed theWetNurse—hung around Rearden with aprimitive,
astonished curiosity which, incredibly, was aform ofadmiration.
Rearden watched himwith disgusted amusement. Theboyhadno
inkling ofanyconcept ofmorality: ithadbeen bred outofhimby
hiscollege; thishad lefthimanoddfrankness, naiveandcynical at
once, liketheinnocence ofasavage.
“You despise me,Mr.Rearden,” hehaddeclared once* suddenly
andwithout anyresentment. “That’s impractical.”
“Why isitimpractical?” Rearden hadasked.
Theboyhadlooked puzzled andhadfound noanswer Henever
hadananswer toany“why?” Hespoke inflatassertions; Hewould
sayabout people, “He's old-fashioned,” “He's unreconstructed,”
”He*s unadjusted ”without hesitation orexplanation; he[would also
336
say,while being agraduate inmetallurgy, “Iron smelting, Ithink,
seems torequire ahightemperature/’ Heuttered nothing butuncer-
tainopinions about physical nature- -andnothing butcategorical im-
pelatives about men.
“Mi Rearden/' hehadsaidonce, “ifyou feelyou’d liketohand

“What tilings?”
'You understand what 1mean.”
“No.” Rearden had said, ”1don’tWhy don’t youexplain itto

Theboyhadlooked athim uncertainly, weighed itinhismind,
thencome outwith: “It'sbadpsychology/’
“What is*’
“You know. Mr.Rearden, it'snotnecessary tousesuchwords

“Aswhat}"

“Run along, punk (ioand trytopour atonotsteel without rigid

Astrange sense, which wasalmost asense otstyle,made Rearden

carried back across atongspan ofcenturies totheagewhere the
boyhadbelonged, buthe.Rearden, hadnotinstead ofbuilding new
furnaces, thought Rearden, hewasnowrunning alosing racetokeep
theoldones going; instead ofstarting new ventures, new research,
newexperiments intheuseofRearden Metal, hew*asspending the
whole ofhisenergy onaquest forsources ofiron ore: likethemen
atthedawn oftheIronAge—hethought— butwith lesshope.
Hetried toavoid these thoughts. Hehadtostandonguard against
hisown feeling- -as ifsome part ofhimhadbecome astranger that
hadtobekeptnumb, and hiswillhadtobeitsconstant, watchful
aaesthetic. That partwasanunknown otwhich heknew only that
hemust never see itsrootandnever give itvoice.Hehad lived
through onedangerous moment which hecould notallow toreturn.
Itwasthemoment when—alone inhisoffice, onawinter evening,
337
heldparalyzed byanewspaper spread onhisdesk withalongcolumn
ofdirectives onthefront page—hehadheard ontheradio thenews
ofEUis Wyatt’s flaming oilfields. Then, his firstreaction— before
anythought ofthefuture, anysense ofdisaster, anyshock, terror
orprotest—hadbeen toburst outlaughing. Hehadlaughed intri-
umph, indeliverance, inaspurting, living exultation— andthewords
which hehadnotpronounced, but felt,were:God bless you. Elhs,
whatever you're doing!
When hehadgrasped theimplications ofhislaughter, hehad
known thathewasnowcondemned toconstant vigilance against
himself. Like thesurvivor ofaheart attack, heknew thathehad
hadawarning andthathecarried within himadanger thatcould
strike him atanymoment.
Hehadheld itoff,since then.Hehadkept aneven, cautious,
severely controlled pace inhisinner steps. But ithadcome close to
himforamoment, once again.When hehadlooked attheorder of
theState Science Institute onhisdesk, ithadseemed tohim that
theglowmoving over thepaper didnotcome from thefurnaces
outside, butfrom theflames ofaburning oilfield.
“Mr Rearden.” said theWetNurse, when heheard about the
rejected order, “you shouldn't havedone that.”
“Why not?”
“There’s going tobetrouble.**
“What kind oftrouble?”
“It’s agovernment order. You can't reject agovernment order.”
“Why can’t 1?”
“it'sanEssential Need project, and secret, too It'svetsimpor-

“What kind ofaproject isit?”
“1don'tknow It’ssecret”
“Then howdoyouknow it'simportant?”
“Itsaidso.”
“Who saidso?”
“You can tdoubt such athing asthat,Mr.Rearden!”
“Why can’t I?”
“Butyouain’t.”
“If 1can’t, then thatwould make itanabsolute andyousaidthere

“That’s different.”
“How isitdifferent?”
“It’s thegovernment.”

“Why?”
“Idon’t wantyoutogetintrouble, Mr.Rearden. and$ouregoing

Rearden glanced athimandchuckled. Theboy noti<|ed hisown
words andgrinned sheepishly, buthelooked unhappy.
Themanwhocame toseeRearden aweek later wjSsyoungish
andslenderish, butneither asyoung norasslender as-hetried to
make himself appear. Hewore civilian clothes andthefeather leg-
338
gings ofatraffic cop.Rearden could notquite get itclearwhether
hecame from theState Science Institute orfrom Washington.
“Iunderstand thatyourefused tosellmetal totheState Science

“That’s right,” saidRearden.
“But wouldn’t thatconstitute awillful disobedience ofthelaw?”
“Itsforyoutointerpret.”
‘May 1askyour reason?”
“Myreason isofnointerest toyou.”
“Oh. butofcourse itis!Wearenotyour enemies, Mr.Rearden.

‘That's uptoyou.”
“We don't want this inthenewspapers“
“No?”
“No.Wewouldn’t want tohurtyou.”
Rearden glanced athimandasked, “Why does theState Science

“Oh, that” It’savery important project ofscientific research, an
undertaking ofgreat social value thatmayprove ofinestimable pub-
liebenefit, but.unfortunately, theregulations oltoppolicy donot

“Listen,” saidRearden slowly, “there might hesome sortofjusti-

Shelaughed; itwasasoft, low, breathless sound. Shecould not

nodded several times, herhairswaying with thewide, circular move-

quiet:
"Dagny, ifsome artist painted you asyouarenow.menwould

"Oh yet*Hank, /understand!” shesaid.Doyou,mydarling? —
doyouunderstand itfully?—shethought, butdidnotsay italoud.
Ontheevening oiablizzard, shecamehome tofindanenormous
spread oftropical flowets standing inherliving room against the
dark glass ofwindows battered bysnowflakes. They were stems of
Hawaiian Torch Ginger, three feet tall, their large heads were cones
ofpetals thathadthesensual texture ofsoftleather andthecolor
ofblood. "Isawthem inaflorist’s window,” hetoldherwhen he
came, that night, "Iliked seeing them through ablizzard. Butthere’s
nothing aswasted asanobject inapublic window."
Shebegan tofindflowers inherapartment atunpredictable times,
flowers sentwithout acard, butwith thesignature ofthesender in
their fantastic shapes, intheviolent colors, intheextravagant cost.
Hebrought heragoldnecklace made ofsmall hinged squares that

thetouch ofthetexture under hisfingers, thetaste ofthedrink and

thesight ofherfacewere thesingle form ofanindivisible moment
ofenjoyment. “Iused toseethings Iliked," hesaid, “but Inever
bought them. There didn’t seem tobemuch meaning in it.There
is,now."
Hetelephoned herattheoffice, onewinter morning, andsaid, not
inthetone ofaninvitation, butinthetone ofanexecutive’s order.
"We’re going tohave dinner together tonight. Iwantyou todress.
Doyouhave anysortofblueevening gown? Wear it."
The dress shewore wasaslender tunic ofdusty blue thatgave

asked, drawing hertoamirror.
Thehuge blanket offurmade herlook likeachild bundled fora

awkward bundle intotheelegance ofaperversely intentional con-
trast: into alook ofstressed sensuality. The furwasasoftbrown,
dimmed hyanaura ofblue thatcould notbeseen, only feltlikean

Shelooked attheangular tiers oflights rising through thesnowy

wheel, attheaustere, fastidious elegance ofthefigure inblack over-

among polished sidewalks andsculptured stone.
The carwentdown into atunnel, streaked through anechoing
tube oftileunder theriver androse tothecoils ofanelevated
highway under anopen black sky.The fights werebelow them now,
spread infiatmiles ofbluish windows, ofsmokestacks, slanting
cranes, redgusts offire,andlong,dimrayssilhouetting thecontorted

When theyspeddown adarkroadthrough anempty countryside,

Thecar leftthehighway andturned toward thelighted squares of
distant windows, thathung above thesnow beyond agrillwork of
bare branches. Then, inasoft,dim light, they satatatable bya
window facing darkness and trees. Theinnstood onaknoll inthe

onlyornament thatcaught herattention was the glitter oficed

She sat,looking out, theblue furhalf-slipping offhernaked arms

satisfaction ofaman studying hisownworkmanship.
“Ilikegiving things toyou,” hesaid, “because youdon't need

“No?”

“That istheway Idoneed them. Hank. From you.”
“Doyouunderstand that it’snothing butvicious self-indulgence

indignation and pity, “ifyou’d givenmethose things just formy

“Yes ...Yes,thenyouwould—andshould.”
“Did you call ityour vicious self-indulgence?”
“That’s what they call it.”

“But I’maluxury object thatyou’ve paid forlongago,” shesaid;

“I’ve never despised luxury,” hesaid, “yet I'vealways despised

Sheasked, smiling. "With your mistress?"
Shesawtheshotofpain inhiseyesandwished desperately that
shehadnotsaid it.
"With ... awoman," heanswered. Sheknew theword hehad
notpronounced. Hewent on. hisvoice softandsteady: "When l

Heraised hisglass, looking ather.
"Hank, I . . .I'dgiveupanything I’veeverhad inmv life,except
mybeing a...aluxury object ofyouiamusement."
Hesawherhand trembling assheheldherglass.Hesaidevenly,
"lknow it,dearest."
Shesatshocked and still:hehadnever used thatwoid before. He
threw hishead back andsmiled themost brilliantly gaysmile she
hadeverseenonhisface.
"Your firstmoment ofweakness, Dagny," hesaid.
Shelaughed andshook herhead.Hestretched hisarmacross the
tableandclosed hishand over hernaked shoulder, asifgiving her
aninstant ssupport. Laughing softly, andasifbyaccident, she let
hermouth brush against hisfingers; itkept herfacedown forthe
onemoment when hecould have seen thebrilliance ofhereyes
was tears.
When shelooked upathim, hersmile matched his—andthe rest
oftheevening wastheircelebration— for allhisyears since thenights
onthemine ledges—for allheryears since thenight ofherjrst ball
when, indesolate longing foranuncaptured vision ofgaiety, tehehad

thatshe, too,hadnotseen thewhole ofthedistance, andsheworn

Walking through thedarkness ofthestreets, onhiswaytoher
apartment, Rearden kept hishands inhiscoatpockets andhisarms
pressed tohissides, because hefeltthathedidnotwant totouch
anything orbrush against anyone. Hehadnever experienced itbe-
fore—thissense ofrevulsion thatwasnotaroused byanyparticular
object, butseemed toflood everything around him,making thecity
seem sodden. Hecould understand disgust foranyone thing, and
hecould fight that thing with thehealthy indignation ofknowing
that itdidnotbelong intheworld; but thiswasnew tohim—this
feeling thattheworld wasaloathsome place where hedidnotwant
tobelong.
Hehadheldaconference with theproducers ofcopper, whohad
justbeen garroted byasetofdirectives thatwould putthem outof
existence inanother year.Hehadhadnoadvice togivethem, no
solution tooffer; hisingenuity, which hadmade himfamous asthe
manwhowould always find away tokeep production going, had
notbeen able todiscover away tosave them. Buttheyhad all
known thatthere wasnoway; ingenuity wasavirtue ofthemind—
and intheissue confionting them, themind hadbeen discarded as
irrelevant longago "it’s adealbetween theboys inWashington
and theimporters ofcopper,'* oneofthemenhad said, “mainly
d’Anconia Copper,*’
Thiswasonlyasmall, extraneous stabofpain,hethought, afeel-
ingofdisappointment ijj,anexpectation hehadnever hadtheright
toexpect; heshould haveknown that thiswasjustwhat aman like
Francisco d’Anconia would do—andhewondered angrily whyhe
teltasifabright, briefflame haddiedsomewhere inalightless world.
He diilnotknow whether theimpossibility ofacting hadgiven
him thissense ofloathing, orwhether theloathing hadmade him
losethedesire toact. It'sboth, hethought; adesire presupposes the
possibility ofaction toachieve it;action presupposes agoal wrtiich is
worth achieving. Iftheonly goal possible wastowheedle aprecari-
ousmoment’s favor frommenwho held guns, then neither action
nordesire could existanylonger.
Then could life?-— heasked himself indifferently. 1ife,hethought,
hadbeen defined asmotion; man’s lifewaspurposeful motion; what
wasthestate ofabeing towhom purpose andmotion were denied,
abeing held inchains but lefttobreathe andtosee allthemagnifi-
cence ofthe possibilities hecould have reached, lefttoscream
'Why?*' andtobeshown themuzzle ofagunassoleexplanation?
Ileshrugged, walking on;hedidnotcareeven tofindananswer.
Heobserved, indifferently, lhedevastation wrought byhisown
indifference. Nomatter howhardastruggle hehadlived through in
thepast,hehadnever reached theultimate ugtiness ofabandoning
thewilltoact.Inmoments ofsuffering, hehadnever letpainwin
Ml
itsonepermanent victory; hehadnever allowed ittomake himlose
thedesire forjoy.Hehadnever doubted thenature oftheworld or
man’s greatness asitsmotive power and itscore. Years ago,hehad
wondered withcontemptuous incredulity about thefanatical sects
thatappeared among men inthedark corners ofhistory, thesects
whobelieved thatmanwastrapped inamalevolent universe ruled
byevilforthesolepurpose ofhistorture. Tonight, heknew what
their vision oftheworld and their feelof ithadbeen. Ifwhat he
nowsawaround himwastheworld inwhich helived, then hedid
notwant totouch anypartofit.hodidnotwant tofight it,hewas
anoutsider withnothing atstakeandnoconcern forremaining alive
much longer.
Dagny andhiswish toseeherwere theonlyexception lefttohim.
Thewishremained. But inasudden shock, herealized thathefelt
nodesire tosleep with hertonight. Thatdesire— which hadnever
given him amoment’s rest,which hadbeen growing, feeding onits
own satisfaction —waswiped out. Itwasanoddimpotence, neither
ofhismind norofhisbody.He felt,aspassionately ashehadever
felt it,(hatshewasthemost desirable woman onearth; butwhat
came from itwasonly adesire todesire het,awish tofeel, nota
feeling. The sense ofnumbness seemed impersonal, as ifitsroot
were neither inhimnorinher; asifitwere theactofsexthatnow
belonged toarealm which hehad left.
‘"Don’t getup—staythere- -it’ssoobvious thatyou’ve been wait-

Hesaid it,from thedoorway ofherapartment, seeing her
stretched inanarmchair, seeing theeager little joltthatthrew her
shoulders forward asshewasabout torise;hewassmiling.
Henoted -as ifsome partofhimwerewatching hisicactions with
detached curiosity— that hissmile and hissudden sense ofgaiety
were real.Hegrasped afeeling thathehadalways experienced, but
never identified because ithadalways been absolute andimmediate
afeeling thatforbade himever toface her inpam. Itwasmuch
more than thepride ofwishing toconceal hissuffering: itwasthe
feeling that suffering must notbegranted recognition inherpies-
ence, thatnoform ofclaim between them should everbemotivated
bypainandaimed atpity. Itwasnotpity thathebrought here or
came here tofind.
“Doyou stillneed proof thatI’malways waiting foryou?” she
asked, leaning obediently back inherchair, hervoice wasneither
tender norpleading, butbright andmocking.
“Dagny, why isitthatmostwomen would never admit that, hut
youdo?”
“Because they’re never sure thattheyought tobewanted. Iam.”
“Idoadmire self-confidence.”
[
“Self-confidence wasonlyonepartofwhat Isaid.Hank.”
“What’s thewhole?” ;
“Confidence ofmyvalue—andyours.” Heglanced at'her as if
catching thespark ofasudden thought, andshelaughed adding.“1

Hewouldn’t wantmeatall.Youwould.”

“Areyousaying/’ heasked slowly* “that lrose inyour estimation
when youfound that Iwanted you?”
“Ofcourse.”
“That’s notthereaction ofmost people ofbeing wanted.”
“Itisn’t.”
“Most people feel that they rise intheirown eyes, ifothers
want them.”
“Ifeelthatothers liveuptome, iftheywant me.And that is
thewayyou feel, too,Hank, about yourself—whether youadmit it
ornot,”
That’s notwhat Isaid toyou then, onthat firstmorning—he
thought, looking down ather.Shelaystretched out lazily, herface
blank, buthereyes bright withamusement. Heknew thatshewas

Ashesathalf-stretched onthecouch, watching heracross the
room, hefeltatpeace—asifsome temporary wallhadrisenbetween
himandthethings hehad fellonhisway here.Hetoldherabout
hisencounter with themanfrom theState Science Institute, because,
even though heknew thattheevent helddanger, anodd,glowing
sense ofsatisfaction stillremained from itinhismind.
Hechuckled atherlookofindignation. "Don’t bother being angry
atthem.” hesaid. “It’snoworse than alltherestofwhat they’re
doing every day,”
“Hank, doyouwantmetospeak toDr.Stadier about it?”
“Certainly not!”
“Heought tostop it.Hecould atleastdothatmuch.”
“I’d rather gotojail.Dr.Stadier? You’re nothaving anything to
dowith him, areyou?”
“Isawhimafewdays ago.”
“Why?”
“Inregard tothemotor.”
“The motor ,..?”Hesaid itslowly, inastrange way, asifthe
thought ofthemotor hadsuddenly brought back tohimarealm he
hadforgotten. “Dagny .. .themanwhoinvented thatmotor ...
hedidexist, didn’t he?”
“Why . .ofcourse. What doyoumean?”
“Imean only that . .that it’sapleasant thought, isn’t it?Even
ifhe'sdead now, hewas alive once...soalive thathedesigned

“What’s thematter, Hank?”
“Nothing. Tellmeabout themotor.”
Shetoldhimabout hermeeting with Dr.Stadier. Shegotupand
paced theroom, while speaking; shecould not liestill,shealways
feltasurge ofhope andofeagerness foraction when shedealt with
thesubject ofthemotor.
The firstthing henoticed were thefights ofthecitybeyond the
window: hefeltasiftheywere being turned on,onebyone,forming
thegreat skyline heloved; hefelt it,eventhough heknew thatthe
lights hadbeen there allthetime.Then heunderstood thatthething
which wasreturning waswithin him; theshape coming backdropby

because hewaslooking atthecitypast thetaut, slender figure ofa

“Why I?”
“Because you’re thevictim.”
Shelooked athim, startled. Hespoke intently: hefeltasudden,
violent clarity ofperception, asitasurge olenergy were; rushing
into theactivify ofsight, fusing thehalf-seen andhalf-grasped into
asingle shape anddirection.
“Dagny, they’re doing something thatwe’ve never u/uferstood.

thefaint outline ofsome shape she, too.had tried tograsp.

Somewhere within him,hoknew thethought shewould notname,

Shehad feltasifadarkmap ofColorado were spiead before her
likeatraffic control panel, with alew* lights scattered through its

which she felt,butcould notdefine; shehadbecome able topredict,
almost with certainty, whowould gonextandwhen: shewasunable
tograsp the“why?”
Ofthemenwhohadonce greeted herdescent from thecabofan

stillrunning theplant ofNielsen Motors. “Ted, youwon tbethe

Itseemed toher thatsome destroyer wasmoving soundlessly
through thecountry andthelights were dying athistouch—some-
one. shethought bitterly, whohadreversed theprinciple ofthe
Twentieth Century motor andwasnow turning kinetic energy into
static.
Thatwastheenemy—shethought, asshesatatherdesk inthe
gathering twilight—withwhom shewasrunning arace.Themonthly
report from Quentin Daniels layonherdesk. Shecould notbe
certain, asyet,thatDaniels would solve thesecret ofthemotor; but
thedestroyer, shethought, wasmoving swiftly, surely, atanever
accelerating tempo; shewondered whether, bythetimesherebuilt

Shehadliked Quentin Daniels from themoment heentered her

“Why didyourefuse towork forDr.Stadler?” sheasked.
The hintofhissmile grew harder andmore stressed; thiswasas
near ashecame toshowing anemotion; theemotion wasanger. But
heanswered inhiseven, unhurried drawl, “You know. Dr.Stadler
once said thatthe firstword of‘Free, scientific inquiry’ wasredun-

Sheasked himwhat position heheld attheUtah Institute of
Technology. “Night watchman,” heanswered. "What?'1shegasped.
“Night watchman,” herepeated politely, asifshehadnotcaught
thewords, asifthere werenocause forastonishment.
Under herquestioning, heexplained thathedidnotlikeanyof
thescientific foundations left inexistence, thathewould have liked
ajob intheresearch laboratory ofsome bigindustrial concern—
“But which oneofthem canafford toundertake anylong-range
worknowadays, andwhyshould they?”— sowhen theUtah Institute
otTechnology wasclosed forlackoffunds, hehadremained there
asnightwatchman andsole inhabitant oftheplace: thesalary was
sufficient topayforhisneeds—andtheInstitute’s laboratory was
there, intact, forhisown private, undisturbed use,
“Soyou're doing research work ofyourown?”
^That’s right.”
“Forwhat purpose?”
“Formyownpleasure.”
“What doyouintend todo, ifyoudiscover something ofscientific

“1don't know. Idon’t think so.'*
‘‘Haven't youanydesire tobeofservice tohumanity?”
“Idon’t talk thatkind oflanguage. Miss Taggart. 1don’t think
youdo,either.”
Shelaughed. “Ithinkwe llgetalong together, vouand I.”
“We will.”
When shehad toldhim thestory ofthemotor, when hehad
studied themanuscript, hemade nocomment, butmerely said that
he>vould take thejobonanyterms shenamed.
Sheasked himtochoose hisownterms Sheprotested, inastonish-
ment, against thelowmonthly salary hequoted. “Miss Taggart,” he
said, “ifthere's something that Iwon’t take, it'ssomething fornoth-
ing. Idon’tknowhowlongyoumight have topayme,orwhether
you'll getanything atallinreturn I’llgamble onmyownmmd I

when I’llskinyou alive, because what 1want then isapercentage,
and it’sgoing tobehigh, but it’sgoing tobeworth your while”
When henamed thepercentage hewanted, shelaughed. “That us

They agreed that itwastobeherprivate project andthathewas
tobeherprivate employee; neither ofthemwanted tohave todeal
with theinterference oftheTaggart Research Department Heasked
toremain inUtah, inhispost ofwatchman, where hehad allthe
laboratory equipment and alltheprivacy heneeded. Theproject was
toremain confidential between them, untilandunless hesucceeded.
“Miss Taggart." hesaid inconclusion, “ldon’tknowhowmany
years itwilltakemetosolve this, ifever. But Iknow that ifIspend
therestofmy lifeon itandsucceed, Iwilldiesatisfied.” Headded,
“There’s onlyonething that 1wantmore than tosolve it:it’sto
meet themanwho has."
Once amonth, since hisreturn toUtah, shehadsenthim acheck
andhehadsentherareport onhiswork. Itwastooearly tohope,
butbisreports were theonly bright points inthestagnant fogolher
days intheoffice.
Sheraised herhead, asshefinished reading hispages. Thecalen-
dar inthedistance said:September 2.The lights ofthe cityhad
grown beneath it,spreading and glittering. Shethought ofRearden.
Shewished hewere inthecity;shewished shewould sechimtonight.
Then, noticing thedate, sheremembered suddenly thatshehad
torushhome todress, because shehad toattend Jim’s wedding
tonight. Shehadnotseen Jim, outside theoffice, forover ayear.
Shehadnotmet hisfiancee, butshehadreadenough atyoul the
engagement inthenewspapers. Sherosefrom herdesk in?wearily
distasteful resignation; itseemed easier toattend theweddjng than
tobother explaining herabsence afterwards.
Shewashurrying across theconcourse oftheTerminal vfrhen she
heard avoice catling, “Miss Taggart!” with astrange noteofjurgcncy
andreluctance, together. Itstopped herabruptly; shetook afew
354
seconds torealize that itwastheoldman atthecigar standwho
had called.
*Tve been waiting tocatch sight ofyou fordays. Miss Taggart.
I’vebeen extremely anxious to.speak toyou.” There wasanodd
expression onhisface, thelook ofaneffort nottolook frightened,
“I’m sorry,” shesaid, smiling, “I’ve been rushing inandoutof
thebuilding allweek anddidn't have time tostop.”
Hedidnotsmile. “Miss Taggart, thatcigarette with thedollar sign
thatyougavemesome months ago—where didyougetit?”
Shestood stillforamoment. ‘Tm afraid that's along*complicated
story,” sheanswered.
“Have youanywayofgetting intouch with theperson whogave
ittoyou?”
“1suppose so—though I’mnotloosure.Why?”
“Would hetellyouwhere hegotit?”
“1don’t know. What makes yoususpect thathewouldn’t?”
Hehesitated, thenasked, “Miss Taggart, whatdoyoudowhenyou
have totellsomeone something which youknow tobeimpossible?”
Shechuckled. “Themanwhogavemethecigarette said that in

“Hedid?About thecigarette?”
“Well, no,notexactly. Butwhy?What isityouhave totellme?”
“Miss Taggart, 1have inquired allover theworld. 1havechecked

Reardcn stood by,watching absently, while thewaiter wheeled
thedinner table outofhishotel room. KenDanagger had left.The

thetimewhen, aged fourteen, famt withhunger, hewould notsteal

would have toinvent some senseless form oftorture forhimself in

Hestood atthewall, waiting, toletalltheevents ofthedaydrop

When thedoor ofhisroom flewopen without warning, hedidnot
quite hearorbelieve it.atfirst.Hesawthesilhouette ofawoman,

Shepressed alight switch bythedoor. Shestood there, fastidiously

“Are you infortheevening, dear?’5sheasked. “Orwere you

Hedidnotknowhow long atime passed before heanswered,
“What areyoudoing here?”
“Why, don’t youremember thatJimTaggart invited ustohis

“Ididn’t intend togotohiswedding.”
“Oh, but ldid!”

Thewedding veilofrose-point lacecaught onthesplintered floor
ofhertenement bedroom. Cherryl Brooks lifted itcautiously, step-

Shehadbeen photographed here allday, asshehadbeenmany
times inthepasttwomonths. She stillsmiled withincredulous grati-
tudewhen newspaper people wanted totake herpicture, butshe
wished theywould notdo ilsooften.
Anaging sob sister, whohad adrippy lovecolumn inprint and

hadchased thereporters out,hadsnapped, “All right, allright, beat

hadhelped hertodress. Shewas todrive Cherryl tothewedding:
shehaddiscovered thatthere wasnoone else todo it.
Thewedding veil, thewhite satingown, thedelicate slippers and
thestrand ofpearls atherthroat, hadcost fivehundred times the
price oftheentire contents ofCherryl's room.Abedtookmost of
theroom’s space, andtherestwastaken byachest ofdrawers, one
chair, andherfewdresses hanging behind afaded curtain. ITiehuge
hoop skiit ofthewedding gown brushed against thewailswhen she
moved, herslender figure swaying above theskirt inthedramatic
contrast ofatight, severe, long-sleeved bodice: thegown hadbeen
made bythebestdesigner inthe city,
“You see.when Igotthejob inthedime store, lcould have
moved toabetter room,” shesaid tothesob sister, inapology, “but
Idon’t think itmatters much where yousleep atnight, soIsavedmy
money, because I’llneed itforsomething important inthefuture—”
Shestopped andsmiled, shaking herhead dazedly. “1thought Td

“You look fine,” saidthesob sister.“You can’t seemuch inthat
alleged mirror, butyou’re okay.”
“Theway allthishappened, 1... Ihaven’t hadtime tocatch up

Cherry lremembered thewonder oltheIkstlimeJim l'aggart had

after then lirstmeeting when shehadgiven uphope ofever seeing
himagain. Shehadbeen miserably embatrassed. shehad feltas if
shewereuying tohold asumise within thespace otamudpuddle—
butJimhadsmiled, silting onheionly chair, looking atherHushed

hehadtaken hertodinnet atthemost expensive restaurant inthe
city.Hehadsmiled atheruncertainty, atherawkwardness, ather
terror ofpicking thewrong toik,and atthelook ofenchantment in
hereyes. Shehadnotknown what hethought Buthehadknown
thatshewasstunned, notbytheplace, butbyhisbringing herthere,
thatshebarely touched thecostly food, thatshetook thedinner,
notasbooty from arichsucker— asallthe girls heknew would
have taken it—butassome shining award shehadnever expected
todeserve
Hehadcome back tohertwoweeks later, andthen their dates
hadgrown progressively more frequent. Hewould drive uptothe

Had hewished, shewould have given himtheonly kind ofpay-
ment shecould offer inreturn. Shewasgrateful thathedidnotseek
it.Butshe fellas iftheir relationship wasanimmense debtandshe
hadnothing topay itwith, except hersilent worship. Hedidnot

There were evenings when hecame totakeherout.butremained
inherroom, instead, andtalked toher.while shelistened insilence,
ftalways happened unexpectedly, with akindofpeculiar abruptness,

herstammering embarrassment. Hesmiled, withanoddkindofeo-
361
joyment, allthrough theevening when theywent toanightduband
shewore thebracelet withhershabby black dress.
Hemade herwear thatbracelet again, onthenightwhen hetook
hertoaparty, agreat reception given byMrs. Cornelius Pope, If
heconsidered hergoodenough tobring intothehome ofhisfriends,
shethought— theillustrious friends whose names shehadseenon
theinaccessible mountain peaks thatwere thesociety columns ot
thenewspapers —shecould notembarrass himbywearing herold
dress. Shespent heryear’s savings onanevening gown ofbright
green chiffon with alowneckline, abeltofyellow roses and arhine-
stone buckle. When sheentered thestern residence, with thecold,
brilliant lights andaterrace suspended over theroofs ofskyscrapers,
sheknew thatherdress waswrong fortheoccasion, though she
could not tellwhy. Butshekept herposture proudly straight and
shesmiled with thecourageous trust ofakitten when itseesahand
extended toplay: people gathered tohave agood timewould not
hurtanyone, shethought.
Attheendofanhour, herattempt tosmilehadbecome 4helpless,
bewildered plea.Then thesmile went, asshewatched thepeople
around her.Shesaw thatthetrim, confident girlshadanasty inso-
lence ofmanner when theyspoke toJim, asifthey didnotrespect
himandnever had.One ofthem inparticular, aBetty Pope, the
daughter ofthehostess, keptmaking remarks tohimwhich Cherry 1
could notunderstand, because shecould notbelieve thatsheunder-
stood them correctly.
Noonehadpaidanyattention toher, atfirst, except forafew
astonished glances athergown After awhile, shesawthem looking
ather.Sheheard anelderly woman askJim, intheanxious lone of
referring tosome distinguished family shehadmissed knowing, ‘‘Did
yousayMissBrooks ofMadison Square?” Shesawanoddsmile on
Jim’s face,when heanswered, making hisvoice sound peculiarly
clear, “Yes—^hecosmetics counter ofRaleigh’s FiveandTen.” Then
shesawsome people becoming toopolite toher,andothers moving
away inapointed manner, andmost ofthem being senselessly awk-
ward insimple bewilderment, andJimwatching silently with that
odd smile.
Shetried togetoutoftheway,outoftheir notice. Assheslipped
by,along theedge oftheroom, sheheard someman say,with a
shrug, “Well, JimTaggart isoneofthemost powerful men inWash-
ington atthemoment.” Hedidnotsay itrespectfully.
Outontheterrace, where itwasdarker, sheheard twomen talking
andwondered whyshe feltcertain thattheywere talking about her.
One ofthem said, “Taggart canafford todo if,ifhepleases,” and
theother saidsomething about thehorse ofsomeRoman emperor
named Caligula.
Shelooked atthelone straight shaft oftheTaggart Building rising
inthedistance— andthen shethought thatsheunderstood: these
people hated Jimbecame theyenvied him.Whatever they^ere, she
thought, whatever theirnames andtheirmoney, none ofthem had
anachievement comparable tohis,none afthem haddefied the
whole country tobuild arailroad everybody thought impossible. For
362
the first time, shesaw thatshedidhave something tooffer Jim:
these people were asmean andsmall asthepeople fromwhom she
hadescaped inBuffalo; hewasaslonely asshehadalways been,and
thesincerity ofherfeeling wastheonly recognition hehadfound.
Then shewalked back intotheballroom, cutting straight through
thecrowd, andtheonly thing leftofthetears shehadtried tohold
back inthedarkness oftheterrace, wasthefiercely luminous sparkle
ofhereyes. Ithewished tostand byheropenly, eventhough she
wasonly ashopgirl, ifhewished toHaunt it,ifhehadbrought her
here toface theindignation ofhisfriends —then itwasthegesture
ofacourageous man defying their opinion, andshewaswilling to
match hiscourage byserving asthescarecrow oftheoccasion.
Butshewasgladwhen itwasover,when shesatbeside him in
hiscar,driving home through thedarkness. She feltableak kind of
relief. Her battling defiance ebbed into astrange, desolate feeling;
shetned nottogiveway to it.Jimsaid little; hesatlooking sullenly
outthecarwindow, shewondered whether shehaddisappointed
him insome manner.
Onthestoop ofherrooming house, shesaid tohim forlornly,
‘Tin sorry it Iletyoudown
Hedidnotanswer foramoment, andthenheasked, “What would
yousay if Iasked youtomarry me?"
Shelooked athim. shelooked around them -there wasafilthy

aquestion insuch aplace, shedidnotknow what itmeant, andshe
answered. “1guess 1 .1haven't anysense ofhumor."
“This isaproposal, mydeal."
then thiswastheway they reached their first kiss-wiih tears
running down herface, tearsunshed attheparty, tears ofshock, of
happiness, ofthinking that thisshould behappiness, andofalow,
desolate voice telling herthat thiswasnotthewayshewould have

Shehadnotthought about thenewspapers, until thedaywhen
Jim toldhertocome toInsapaitmcnt andshefound itcrowded
withpeople whohadnotebooks, cameras andHash bulbs.When she
sawherpicture inthepapers lorthe firsttime- apicture otthem

dered proudly whether every person inthecityhadseen it.After a
while, thedelight vanished.
They keptphotographing her atthedime-store counter, inthe

toldherself nottobeungrateful, when she felthurtShe felt itonly
inafewraremoments, when sheawakened inthemiddle ofthe
nightandlayinthesilence ofherroom, unable tosleep. Sheknew
that itwould takeheryears torecover, tobelieve, tounderstand.
Shewasreeling through herdays likeaperson with asunstroke,
seeing nothing butthefigure ofJimTaggart asshehadseenhim

‘‘listen, kid,** thesob sister said toher,when shestood inher

“1don’t think I'mafraid,” shesaid,looking intently straight before
her,theradiance ofhersmile melting theearnestness ofherglance.
“Ihavenoright tobeafraid ofanything. I’mtoohappy. You see,
Ialways thought thatthere wasn't anysense inpeople saying that

“Money istherootofallevil,” saidJames Taggart. “Money can t
buyhappiness. Love willconquer anybarrier andanysocial distance.
Thatmaybeabromide, boss, butthat’show Ifeel.”
Hestood under thelights oftheballroom oftheWayne-Falkland
Hotel, inacircle Ofreporters whohadclosed about himthemoment
thewedding ceremony ended. Heheard thecrowd ofguests beating
likeatidebeyond the circle. Cherryl stood beside him, herwhite-
gloved hand onjthe black ofhissleeve. Shewas stilltrying tohear the
words oftheceremony, notquite believing thatshehadheard them.
-“How doyou feel, Mrs. Taggart ?”
Sheheard thequestion fromsomewhere inthecircle ofreporters.
Itwas likethejoltofreturning toconsciousness: twowords suddenly
made everything real toher.Shesmiled andwhispered, choking,
“I ...I’mveryhappy ..
Atopposite ends oftheballroom, Orren Boyle, whoseemed too
stout forhisfull-dress clothes, andBertram Scudder, whoseemed
toomeager for his.surveyed thecrowd ofguests with thesame
thought, though neither ofthem admitted thathewasthinking it
Orren Boyle half-told himself thathewaslooking forthefaces of

ering material foranarticle. Butboth,unknown toeach olhef, were
drawing amental chart ofthefaces theysaw, classifying then* under
twoheadings which, ifnamed, would have read:“Favor” and‘fFcaf.”

theunwritten code oftheday,hobody received oraccepted aninvita-
tionfrom amanofpublic prominence except intoken ofoneorthe
other ofthese motives. Those inthe firstgroup were, forthemost
part, youthful; theyhadcome from Washington. Those inthesecond
group were older; theywere businessmen.
Orren Boyle andBertram Scudder weremenwhousedwords as
apublic instrument, tobeavoided intheprivacy ofone’sownmind.
Woids were acommitment, carrying implications which theydidnot
wish toface.They needed nowords fortheir chart; theclassification
wasdone byphysical means: arespectful movement oftheir eye-
brows, equivalent totheemotion oftheword “So!” forthe first
group-— and asarcastic movement oftheir lips, equivalent tothe
emotion of“Well, well!” forthesecond. One laceblewupthe

Orren Boyle burst outlaughing. Taggart tinned tohimsosharply

Cherryl's eyes followed James Taggart through thecrowd. The
faces thatkept shifting andgathering around herseemed sofriendly
and their voices were soeagerly warm thatshe fellcertain therewas
nomalice anywhere intheroom. Shewondered whysome ofthem

could notdisgrace theperson of“Mrs. Taggart” byanytouch offear.
Then shesawtheenemy. Itwasatall,slender figure inagray

nojewelry, only abracelet onherwrist, achain ofheavy metal links
with agreen blue cast.
Cherryl waited, until shesawDagny standing alone, then tore
forward, cutting resolutely across theroom. Shelooked atdose
range intothegun-metal eyes thatseemed coldandintense atonce,
theeyes that looked ather directly with apolite, impersonal
curiosity.
.“There’s something 1wantyoutoknow,” saidCherryl, hervoice
tautandharsh, “sothattherewon tbeanypretending about it.I’m

“That's quite allright," saidDagny. "Pm theman."
Chenyl watched herwalk away, andthought thatJimhadbeen
right: this sister ofhiswasacreature ofcold evilwhohadgiven her
noresponse, noacknowledgment, noemotion ofanykindexcept a
touch ofsomething thatlooked likeanastonished, indifferent

Rearden stood byLillian’s sideandfollowed herwhen shemoved.

James Taggart saw Lillian Reardon drift casually toward him at
theonemoment when hechanced tobealone inthedimcorner
between apotted palm andawindow. Hestopped andwaited tolet
herapproach. Hecould notguess herpurpose, but thiswasthe
manner which, inthecode heunderstood, meant thathehadbetter
hear her.
“How doyou likemywedding gift,Jim?" sheasked, andlaughed
athislook ofembarrassment “No, no,don't trytogoover the list
otthings inyour apartment, wondering which onethehell itwas.
It’snotmyour apartment, it’sright here, and it’sanon-material

Hesawthehalf-hint ofasrmle onherface, thelookunderstood

presence isthebest giftyoucould giveme.”
“Mypresence, Jim?”
The lines ofhisfacewere shock-bound foramoment. Heknew
what shemeant, buthehadnotexpected hertomean it.
Shesmiled openly. “We bothknow whose presence isthemost
valuable oneforyoutonight—andtheunexpected one.Didn't you
really think ofgivingmecredit forit?I’msurprised atyou. 1thought
youhadagenius forrecognizing potential friends.”
Hewould notcommit himself; hekept hisvoice carefully neutral.
“Have Ifailed toappreciate your friendship, Lillian?”
"Now, now, darling, youknow what I’mtalking about. You didn’t
expect himtocome here,youdidn’t really think thatheisafraid of
you, didyou?But tohave theothers think heis—that’s quite an
inestimable advantage, isn’t it?”
"I’m .. .surprised, Lillian."
"Shouldn’t yousay‘impressed’? Your guests arequite impressed.
Icanpractically hearthem thinking allover theroom. Most ofthem
arethinking: ifhehastoseekterms withJimTaggart, we’d belter

think ofspoiling yourtriumph—butyouand Iaretheonly'oneswho
know thatyoudidn’t achieve itsingle-handed."
Hedidnotsmile; heasked, hisface blank, hisvoice smooth, but
with acarefully measured hintofharshness, "What’s your angle?"
Shelaughed. "Essentially —thesame asyours. Jim.Butspeaking

Helooked straight atherforthe firsttime, hiseyesnarrowed, his

which, forboth ofthem, meant thatthey felt athome witheach

‘Tm aware ofit."There was the faintest coating ofmockery
spread, likeshellac, over thesmooth notes ofhervoice.
Hewasstudying herinsolently. “You must forgive me iffthink
thatsome curiosity ispermissible between friends,” hesaid, withno
tone ofapology. “I’mwondering fromwhat angle youcontemplate

Sheshrugged. “From theangle ofahorsewoman, darling;. Ifyou

“None.”
“No love affairs?”
“(iod, no!”
Sheslnugged, insignofchanging thesubject: Dagny Taggart was

said.“He looks worried, because youhaven’t looked athim alleve-

Dagny turned atherapproach. Among themany things that Lillian
resented, theimpersonal politeness ofDagny 'sface w'astheoneshe
resented most,
“What doyouthink ofyour brother’s marriage. Miss Taggart?”
sheasked casually, smiling.
“Ihavenoopinion about it.”
“Doyoumean tosay thatyou don’t find itworthy ofany

“Ityouwish tobeexact yes, that’s what 1mean.”
“Oh, butdon't yousecanyhuman significance init?”
“No.”
“Don’t youthink thataperson such asyour brother's bride does

SMWhy, no,”
“Ienvy you.Miss Taggart. 1envy yourOlympian detachment. It

“What achievements arewetalking about?”
“Don’t yougrant anyrecognition atalltothewomen who attain

“1don't think that there issuch aword as‘conquest*—inthe

“Oh, butconsider, forinstance, howhard otherwomen would
havehadtowork— ifworkwere theonlymeans available tothem—
toachieve what this girlhasachieved through theperson ofyour

“Idon’t think sheknows theexact nature ofwhat shehas
achieved.”
Rearden sawthem together. Heapproached. Hefeltthathehad
tohear it,nomatter what theconsequences. Hestopped silently
beside them.Hedidnotknow whether Lillian wasaware ofhis
presence; heknew thatDagny was.
“Doshow alittle generosity toward her.Miss Taggart,” said Lil-
lian.“At least, thegenerosity ofattention. Youmust notdespise the
women whodonotpossess your brilliant talent, butwho exercise
theirown particular endowments. Nature always balances her gifts
andoffers compensations— don't youthink so?”
“T’m notsure 1understand you.”
“Oh,Tmsureyoudon’t want tohearmebecome more explicit!”
“Why, yes, 1do.”
Lillian shrugged angrily; among thewomen whowere herfriends,
shewould havebeen understood andstopped long ago;butthiswas
anadversary new toher—awoman whorefused tobehurt.Shedid
notcare tospeak more dearly, butshesawRearden looking ather.
Shesmiled andsaid,“Well, consider your sister-in-law. MissTaggart.

Sheturned togo,butLillian’s voice stopped her:“1would liketo

“Why, no, 1can’t saythat Idid, 1hadnotseenmybrother’s

“Then whyareyouwearing thatbracelet?”

Dagny’s eyesmoved deliberately straight tohers. “Ialways wear

“Don’t youthink that that’s carrying ajoke toofar?”
“Itwasnever ajoke, Mrs.Rearden.”
“Then you'll understand me if Isaythat I’dlikeyoutogive that

“1understand you.But 1willnotgive itback.'’
Lillian letamoment pass, asiftoletthem bothacknowledge the

“Anything youwish.”
“What isyourmotive?”
“Youknewmymotive when yougavemethebracelet.”
Lillian glanced atRearden. Hisfacewasexpressionless; shesaw

Hersmilecame back, asaprotective shield, anamused, patroniz-

again.“Lm sure. Miss Taggart, thatyou realize howenormously
improper this is.’’
“No.”
“But surely youknow thatyouaretaking adangerous andugly

“No.”
“You donottake intoconsideration thepossibility ofbeing .. .

“No.”
Lilhan shook herhead insmiling reproach. “Miss Taggart, don't
youthink that this isacasewhere onecannot atford toindulge in

Dagny would notsmile “Ihave never understood what ismeant

“Imean thatyour attitude maybehighly idealistic --as 1amsure

Dagny waslooking straight ather, “1don't.”
“Butyoucannot ignore that possibility.”
“1do.”Dagny turned togo.
“Oh, butshould youwish toevade adiscussion ifyouhavenothing

Dagny asked slowly, “What isthedanger toMr.Rearden?”
“Pm sureyouunderstand me.”
“Idon't.”
“Oh, butsurely itisn’tnecessary tobemore explicit”
“It is—ifyouwish tocontinue thisdiscussion.”
Lillian’s eyeswent toReardon’s face, searching forsome sign to
helpherdecide whether tocontinue ortostop.Hewould nothelp
her.
“Miss Taggart,” shesaid, “1amnotyour equal inphilosophical
altitude. Iamonlyanaverage wife. Please givemethatbracelet—
ifyoudonotwishmetothink what Imight think andwhat you

“Mrs. Rearden, isthisthemanner andplace inwhich youchoose

“Certainty not!”The crywasimmediate; ithadasound ofpanic
andthequality ofanautomatic reflex, likethejerkofwithdrawal
ofapickpocket’s hand caught inaction. Sheadded, withanangry,
nervous chuckle, inatone ofsarcasm andsincerity thatconfessed a
reluctant admission ofheractual opinion, “That would bethepossi-
bility farthest frommymind.”
“Then you willplease apologize toMiss Taggart,” saidRearden.
Dagny caught herbreath, cutting off allbutthefaintecho ofa
gasp.They both whirled tohim. Lillian sawnothing inhisface;
Dagny sawtorture.
“Itisn’t necessary-. Hank,” shesaid.
“It is—forme.” heanswered coldly, notlooking ather;hewas
looking atLillian inthemanner ofacommand thatcould notbe
disobeyed.
Lillian studied hisfacewithmildastonishment, butwithout anxiety
oranger, likeaperson confronted byapuzzle ofnosignificance.
“But ofcourse,” shesaidcomplaisantly, hervoice smooth andcon-
fident again. “Please accept myapology. MissTaggart, if1gaveyou

Sheturned andwalked away indifferently, leaving them together,
asifindeliberate proof ofherwords
Dagny stood still,hereyes closed; shewasthinking ofthenight
when Lillian hadgiven herthebracelet. Hehadtaken hiswife’s

Her firstwordwasthemost violent oftheseveral blows hefelt;
shehadnever used thatword before. Shehadnever lethimhear

Shesmiled andturned away from him.
James Taggart heldanempty champagne glass inhishand and
noticed thehaste with which Balph Eubank waved atapassing
waiter, as ifthewaiter were guilty ofanunpardonable lapse. Then
Eubank completed hissentence:
“—butyou,Mr.Taggart, would know that amanwho livesona

struggle— trying toobtain support forliterature from aworld ruled
bybusinessmen. They arenothing butstuffy, middle-class vulgarians

"You’re amanofculture, Jim,” saidDr.Pritchett, "you're notan

"You really likedmy lastnovel, Mr.Taggart?” Balph Eubank
kept asking. “You really liked it?”
Orren Boyle glanced atthegroup, onhisway across theroom,

They whirled around. Themanwhostood facing them wasFran-
cisco d’Anconia.

“How didyougethere?” wasthe firstthingJames Taggart found

“Byplane toNewark, bytaxifrom there, thenbyelevator from

“Ididn't mean ...that is,what Imeant was—”
“Don't look sostartled, James. If 1land inNewYork andhear
that there’s aparty going on, Iwouldn’t miss it,would I?You've
always said thatFmjustaparty hound/’
Thegroup waswatching them.
“I’m delighted toseeyou,ofcourse,’’ Taggart saidcautiously, then
added belligerently, tobalance it,“But ifyouthink you’re going
to—’
Francisco would notpickupthethreat; heletTaggart’s sentence
slide intomid-air andslop, thenasked politely, “If Ithink what?”
“You understand mevery well.”
“Yes. Ido.Shall ltellyouwhat Ithink 7”
“This ishardly themoment forany—”
“Ithinkyoushould present metoyour bride, James. Yourman-
nershavenever been glued toyoutoosolidly—yoi*always losethem
inanemergency, and that’s thetimewhen oneneeds them most.”
Turning toescort himtoward Cherry 1,Taggart caught the faint
sound thatcame from Bertram Scudder; itwasanunborn chuckle.
Taggart knew thatthemenwhohadcrawled athisfeet amoment
ago,whose hatred forFrancisco d’Anconia was, perhaps, greater
than hisown,were enjoying thespectacle none theless.Theimplica-
tions ofthisknowledge wereamong thethings hedidnotcare to
name.
Francisco bowed toCherryl andoffered hisbestwishes, asifshe
were thebride ofaroyal heir.Watching nervously, Taggart fellre-
lief—andatouch ofnameless resentment, which, ifnamed, would
have toldhimhewished theoccasion deserved thegrandeur that
Francisco’s manner gave itforamoment.
Hewasafraid toremain byFrancisco’s sideandafraid tolethim
looseamong Theguests. Hebacked afewtentative steps away, but
Francisco followed him, smiling.
“You didn’t think I’dwant tomissyour wedding, James—when
you’remychildhood friend andbeststockholder?”
“What?”gasped Taggart, andregretted it:thesound wasaconfes-
sionofpanic.
Francisco didnotseem totakenote ofit;hesaid, hisvoice gaily
innocent, “Oh, butofcourse Iknow it. Iknow thestooge behind
thestooge behind every name onthe listofthestockholders of
d’Anconia Copper. It’ssurprising howmanymenbythename of
Smith andGomez arerichenough toown bigchunks oftherichest

learnwhat distinguished persons Iactually haveamong myminority
stockholders. Iseem tobepopular withanastonishing collection of
public figures from allover theworld— from People’s States where
youwouldn’t think there’s anymoney leftatall.”
Taggart said dryly, frowning, “There aremany reason#*— business
reasons—why itissometimes advisable nottomake oijie’s invest-
ments directly.”
“One reason isthatamandoesn’t want people tokno^ he’s rich.
Another isthathedoesn’t wantthem tplearnhowhegotthatway.”
“Idon’tknow whatyoumean orwhyyoushould objtfct.”

“Oh, 1don’t object atall. Iappreciate it.Agreatmany investors—
theold-fashioned sort—dropped meafter theSanSebastian Mines.
Itscared them away. Butthemodern oneshadmore faithmmeand
acted astheyalways do—onfaith. Ican’t tellyouhowthoroughly l

Taggart wished Francisco would nottalksoloudly: hewished peo-
plewould notgather around them.“You havebeen doing extremely
well,” hesaid, inthesafetone ofabusiness compliment.
“Yes, haven’t 1?It’swonderful howthestock ofd'Anconia Chop-
perhasrisen within the lastyear.But Idon’t think Ishould betoo
conceited about it—there’s notmuch competition leftintheworld,

cided that it’sthebestplace loryourhidden money, that itcan'tbe

“Well, 1hear itsaid thatyou've begun totakeyour responsibilities
seriously andthatyou’ve settled down tobusiness atlast.'They say
you've been working very hard.”
“Oh, hasanybody noticed that? Itwastheold-lashioned investors
whomade itapoint towatch what thepresident olacompany was
doing Themodern investors don’t tindknowledge necessary, 1don't

Taggart smiled. “They look attheticker tape otthestock ex-

“Yes. Yes, itdoes— inthelongrun.”
“1must sayI'mglad thatyouhaven't beenmuch otapartyhound

“Do they? Well, no,notquite yet.”

“Oh, but Ihadtocome lthought youwere expecting me.”
“Why, no, 1wasn’t . . .that is, 1mean—”
“You should have expected me,James. This isthegreat, formal,

“What inhelldoyouthink you're saying?” Taggait cried furiously,
seeing thetension onthefacesaround them.
“Becareful, James. Ifyou trytopretend thatyoudon’t understand

“Ifyouthink it'sproper touttersuch—”
“Ithink it’sfunny There was atimewhenmenwere afraid that

“Ifyouthink it’sproper tocome toacelebration such asawed-

“Why, James, 1came here tothank you."
“Tothankme?”
“Ofcourse. You’ve donemeagreat favor—youandyourboys in

intheworld isthere anycopper left—unless it'sd’Anconia copper?
Soyouseethat Ihavegood reason tobegrateful.”
“1assure you Ihadnothing todowith it,”Taggart said hastily,
“and besides, the vitaleconomic policies ofthiscountry arenot
determined byanyconsiderations such asyou're intimating or—”
“Iknowhow they're determined, James. Iknow that thedeal

“Who gave youanvgrounds toinvent anoutrageous story of

“Nobody. Iknew nothing about it.1justsawtheleapontheticker

boys inSantiago slapped anew taxoncopper thefollowing week—
andthey toldmethat 1shouldn’t mind, notwith thesudden riseof

said,whyshould icare—taking thetwoevents together, Iwasricher

“Why doyouwish totellmethis?”•
“Why don’t youwish totakeanycredit for it,James'! That's out

“Think what afavor Ireceived without anyeffort onmypart. I

thingwasarranged without me—and all Ihave todonow isproduce

that Iwillrepay it."
Francisco turned abruptly, notwaiting forananswer, andstarted
away. Taggart didnotfollow; hestood, feeling thatanything was
preferable toonemore minute oftheir conversation.
Francisco stopped when hecame toDagny. Helooked atherfor
asilent instant, without greeting, hissmile acknowledging thatshe
hadbeen the firstperson hesawandthe firstonetoseehim athis
entrance intotheballroom.
Against every doubt andwarning inhermind, she feltnothing but
ajoyous confidence; inexplicably, she feltasifhisfigure inthat
crowd wasapoint ofindestructible security. But inthemoment
when thebeginning ofasmile toldhimhow glad shewas tosee
him,heasked, “Don't youwant totellmewhat abrilliant achieve-
ment theJohn (jalt Line turned outtobe?”
She felther lipstrembling andtightening atonce, assheanswered,
“I'm sorry ifIshow thatFm stillopen tobehurt. Itshouldn't shock
methatyou’ve come tothestage where youdespise achievement.”
“Yes, don’t I? Idespise thatLine somuch that 1didn’t want to

Hesawherlook ofsudden attentiveness, thelook ofthought
ruling intoabreach tornopenupon anew direction. Hewatched
hciforamoment, asifheknew every stepshewould tindalong
thatload, thenchuckled andsaid.“Don't youwant toaskinenow:
Who isJohn Galt?”
“Why should 1want to.andwhynow?"
“Don’t youremember thatyoudared himtocome andclaim your
line? Well, hehas.”
Hewalked on,notwaiting toseethelook inhereyes— alook
thatheld anger, bewilderment and the first faintgleam ofaques*
nonmark.
Itwasthemuscles ofhisown face thatmade Rcardcn realize the
nature ofhisreaction toFrancisco's arrival; henoticed suddenly that
hewassmiling andthat hisfacehadbeen relaxed intothedimwell-
being ofasmile forsome minutes past, ashewatched Francisco
d'Anconia inthecrowd.
Heacknowledged tohimself, forthe firsttime, allthehalf-grasped,
halt-rejected moments when hehadthought ofFrancisco d'Anconia
andthiust thethought aside before itbecame theknowledge ofhow
much hewanted toseehim again. Inmoments ofsudden exhaus-
tion— alhisdesk, with the firesofthefurnaces goingdown inthe
twilight— inthedarkness ofthelonely walkthrough theempty coun-
tryside tohishouse—inthesilence ofsleepless nights—hehadfound
himself thinking oftheonlymanwhohadonceseemed tobehis
spokesman. Hehadpushed thememory aside, telling himself: But
379
thatone isworse than alltheothers!—while feeling certain that this
wasnottrue, yetbeing unable toname thereason ofhiscertainty.
Hehadcaught himself glancing through thenewspapers tosee
whether Francisco d’Anconia hadreturned toNewYork—andhe
hadthrown thenewspapers aside, asking himself angrily: What ifhe
didreturn?—would yougochasing himthrough nightdubs and
cocktail parties?— what isitthatyouwantfromhim?
Thiswaswhat hehadwanted—hethought, when hecaught himself
smiling atthesight ofFrancisco inthecrowd—thisstrange leeling
ofexpectation thatheld curiosity, amusement andhope.
Francisco didnotseem tohave noticed him.Rearden waited,
fighting adesire toapproach; notafter thekind ofconversation we
had.hethought—whatfor?— what would lsaytohim?And then,
with thesame smiling, light-hearted feeling, thefeeling ofbeing cer-
tain that itwas right, hefound himself walking across theballroom,
toward thegroup thatsurrounded Francisco d’Anconia.
Hewondered, looking atthem, why these people weredrawn to
Francisco, whytheychose toholdhimimprisoned inaclinging circle,
when their resentment ofhimwasobvious under their smiles. Their
faceshadthehintofalook peculiar, nottofear, buttocowardice:
alook ofguilty anger. Francisco stood cornered against theside
edge ofamarble stairway, half-leaning, half-sitting onthesteps; the
informality ofhisposture, combined with the strict formality ofhis
clothes, gavehimanairofsuperlative elegance. Hiswastheonly
face thathadthecarefree lookandthebrilliant smile proper tothe
enjoyment ofaparty: buthiseyesseemed intentionally expression-
less, holding notrace ofgaiety, showing—like awarning signal -
nothing buttheactivity ofaheightened perceptiveness.
Standing unnoticed ontheedge otthegroup. Rearden heard a
woman, whohadlargediamond earrings andaflabby, nervous face,
asktensely, “Senor d’Anconia, whatdoyouthink isgoing tohappen
totheworld?”
“Just exactly what itdeserves.”
“Oh,how cruel!”
“Don't youbelieve intheoperation ofthemoral law.madame?”
Francisco asked gravely. ‘1do.”
Rearden heard Bertram. Scudder, outside thegroup, saytoagirl
whomade some sound ofindignation, “Don't lethimdisturb you.
Youknow, money istherootofallevil--and he’sthetypical product
ofmoney.”
Rearden didnotthink thatFrancisco could have heard it,buthe
sawFrancisco turning tothem with agravely courteous smile.
“Soyouthink thatmoney istherootofallevil?” saidFrancisco
d’Anconia. “Have youeverasked what istherootofmoney? Money

Francisco hadnotglanced atRearden once while speaking; but
themoment hefinished, hiseyeswent straight toKcarden's face.
Rearden stood motionless, seeing nothing butFrancisco d'Anconia
across themoving figures andangry voices between them.
There weie people whohad listened, butnowhurried away, and
people who said, “It’s horrible!"— ’it's nottrue!" -""How vicious
and selfish!" -saying itloudly andguardedly atonce, asifwishing
that their neighbors would hear them, buthoping thatFrancisco
would not.
"Seiior d’Anconia," declared thewoman with theearrings, "I
don’t agree withyou!"
V
I(youcanretule asingle sentence 1ulleicd, madame, 1shall
heat itgratefully."
“Oh. Ican't answer you Idon’t have anyanswers, mymind
doesn't work thatway, but Idon’t feelthatyou're riaht, so Iknow
thatyou’ie wrong."
“flow doyouknow it?"
"IJed it. \don’t gobymyhead, butbymyheart.Youmight be
good atlogic, butyou're heartless."
"Madame, whenwe llseemendying ofstarvation around us.your
heart won't beofanyearthly usetosave them.And I'mheartless
enough tosaythatwhen you'll scream, ‘but Ididn't know it!'—you
willnotbeforgiven."
Thewoman turned away, ashudder running through thetksh of
hercheeks andthrough theangry tremor ofhervoice; "Well, it's
certainly afunny way totalk ataparly!"
Aportly man with evasive eyes said loudly, histone offorced
cheerfulness suggesting that hisstileconcern inanyissuewasnotto
let itbecome unpleasant, "Ifthis isthewayyou feelabout money,
sertor, 1think I’mdarn glad that I’vegotagoodly piece ofd'Anconia
Topper stock."
Francisco said gravely, "lsuggest thatyouthink twice, sir."
Rearden started toward him—andFrancisco, whohadnotseemed
h>look inhisdilection, moved tomeethim atonce, asiftheothers
hadnever existed.
"Hello,” saidReatden simply, easily, astoachildhotxl friend; he
wassmiling.
Hesaw hisown smile reflected inFrancisco’s face. "Hello."
385
“Iwant tospeak toyou.”
"Towhom doyouthink I’vebeen speaking forthe lastquarter
ofanhour?*’
Rearden chuckled, inthemanner ofacknowledging anopponent’s
round, ‘ldidn't think youhadnoticed me."
“Inoticed, when Icame in,thatyouwereoneoftheonlytwo
persons inthisroomwhowere glad toseeme."
"Aren't youbeing presumptuous?"
"No—grateful."
"Who wastheother person glad toseeyou?"
Francisco shrugged andsaid lightly, “Awoman"
Rearden noticed thatFrancisco hadledhim aside, away from the
group, insoskillfully natural amanner thatneither henortheotheis
hadknown itwasbeing done intentionally.
"1didn’t expect tofindyouhere," saidFrancisco. "You shouldn’t
havecome tothisparty."
"Why not?"
"May 1askwhatmade youcome?"
“My wifewasanxious toaccept theinvitation"
“Forgive me itIput itinsuch form, but itwould havebeenmuch
more proper and lessdangerous ifshehadasked you totake her
onatourofwhorehouses."
"What danger areyoutalking about?”
"Mr. Rearden, youdonotknow these people's wayofdoing busi
nessorhowthey interpret yourpresence here Inyour code, butnot
intheirs, accepting aman's hospitality isatoken ofgood will, a
declaration thatyouandyour host stand onterms ofacivilized
relationship. Don't givethem thatkind otsanction."
“Then whydidyoucome here?"
Francisco shrugged gaily. ‘‘Ob. f—itdoesn't matter what Ido.Tm
only aparly hound."
"What areyoudoing atthisparty?”
"Just looking forconquests."
"Found any?"
Hisfacesuddenly earnest. Francisco answered gravely, almost sol-
emnly, “Yev— what Ithink isgoing tobemybestandgreatest."
Rearden's anger wasinvoluntary, thecry,notofreproach, butof
despair: "How canyouwaste yourself thatway*"
The faint suggestion ofasmile, likethe riseofadistant light,
came intoFrancisco’s eyes asheasked,"Doyoucare toadmit that
youcareabout it?"
“You’re going tohear afewmore admissions, ifthat’s what you’re
after. Before Imetyou, 1used towonder howyoucould waste a
fortune such asyours.Now it’sworse, because 1can’t .despise you
as Idid,asI’dlike to,yetthequestion ismuch more terrible: How
Canyouwaste amind such asyours?"
"1don’t thinkFmwasting itrightnow."
"Idon'tknow whether there’s everbeen anything thatmeant a
damn toyou—butI’mgoing totellyouwhat I’ve ifever said to
anyone before. When Imetyou,doyouremember tjiatyou said
youwanted tooffermeyour gratitude?"
386
There wasnotrace ofamusement leftinFrancisco’s eyes;Rearden
hadnever faced sosolemn alook ofrespect. “Yes, Mr.Rearden,”
heanswered quietly.
“1toldyouthat Ididn’t need itand Iinsulted youfor it.Allright,
you’ve won.That speech youmade tonight—thatwaswhatyouwere
offering me,wasn’t it?”
“Yes, Mr.Rearden.”
“Itwasmore than gratitude, and 1needed thegratitude; itwas
more than admiration, and 1needed that, t<xr, itwasmuch more
thananyword 1can find, itwilltakemedays tothink ofallthat
it’sgivenme—butonething 1doknovy: Ineeded it.I’venevermade
anadmission ofthiskind, because I’venever cried foranyone’s help.
Ifitamused you toguess that Jwasglad toseeyou.youhave
something realtolaugh about now. ifyouwish.”
“Itmight takemeafewyears, but Iwillprove toyouthatthese
arethethings ldonotlaugh about”
“Prove itnow—byanswering onequestion: Why don't youprac-
ticewhat youpreach'”'
“Are yousure that 1don't?”
“Ifthethings yousaidaretrue, ifyouhave thegreatness toknow
it,youshould havebeen theleading industrialist oftheworld by
now.”
Francisco saidgravely, ashehadsaid totheportly man, butwith
anoddnote ofgentleness inhisvoice, “1suggest thatyouthink
twice, Mr.Rearden,”
“I’ve thought about youmore than Icare toadmit. Ihavefound
noanswer.”
“Letmegiveyouahint: Ifthethings 1saidaretrue,who isthe
guiltiest man inthisroom tonight?”
“Isuppose—James Taggart?”
“No, Mr,Rearden, itisnotJames Taggart Butyoumust define
theguiltandchoose theman youiself.”
“Afewyears ago, 1would have said that it’syou. 1stillthink that
that’s what Iought tosay.ButPmalmost intheposition ofthat
!oolwoman whospoke toyou:every reason 1know tellsmethatyou’re

“You aremaking thesame mistake asthatwoman, Mr.Rearden,

“What doyoumean”’
Imeanmuch more than justyourjudgment ofme.Thatwoman

desires, Mr.Rearden. Don’t sacrifice them. Examine their cause.
There isalimit tohowmuch youshould have tobear.”
“How didyouknow thisabout me?”
“Imade thesame mistake, once. Butnotforlong.”
”1wish—”Rearden began andstopped abruptly.
Francisco smiled. ‘Afraid towish, Mr.Rearden?”
“1wish 1could permit myself tolikeyouasmuch as 1do.”
“Fdgive—”Francisco stopped; inexplicably. Rearden sawthelook
ofanemotion which hecould notdefine, yetfellcertain tobepain;
hesawFrancisco’s firstmoment ofhesitation. “Mr. Rearden, doyou
ownanyd’Anconia Copper stock?”
Rearden looked athim, bewildered. “No.”
“Some day, you’ll know what treason I'mcommitting right now,
but . . .Don’t everbuyanyd’Anconia Copper stock. Don't ever
dealwithd’Anconia Copper inanyway.”
“Why?”
“When you’ll learn the lullreason, you’ll know whether there’s
everbeen anything—oranyone- thatmeant adamn tome.and . . .
andhowmuch hedidmean”
Rearden frowned: hehadremembered something. “Iwouldn’t
dealwithyourcompany. Didn't you callthem themen ofthedouble
standard? Aren’t youoneofthelooters who isgrowing rich right
nowbymeans ofdirectives?”
Inexplicably, thewords didnot hitFrancisco asaninsult, hut
cleared hisfaceback into hislook ofassurance. “Didyouthink that
itwas Iwhowheedled those directives outoftherobber planners?”
“Ifnot.thenwhodid it*”
“My hitchhikers.”
“Without yourconsent?”
“Without myknowledge.”
“I’dhate toadmit howmuch lwant tobelieve you-butthere’s
noway foryoutoprove itnow”
“No? HIprove ittoyouwithin thenext fifteen minutes.”
“How? The factremains thatyou’ve profited themost from
those directives.”
“That’s true. I’ve profited more than Mr.Mouch and hisgang
could ever imagine. Aftermyyears ofwork, theygavemejustthe
chance 1needed.”
“Are youboasting?”
“You bet Iam!” Rearden sawincredulously thatFrancisco’s eyes
hadahard, bright look, thelook, notofaparty hound, butofa
man ofaction. “Mr. Rearden. doyouknow where most ofthose
new aristocrats keep theirhidden money? Doyouknow where most
ofthefair-share vultures have invested their profits from Rearden
Metal?”
“No,but—”
,
“Ind’Anconia Copper stock. Safely outofthewayand <>utofthe
country. D’Anconia Copper- anold,invulnerable company, sorich
that itwould lastforthreemore generations oflooting. Accompany
managed byadecadent playboy whodoesn’t giveadamm^vho’ll let

makemoney forthem—automatically, asdidhisancestors. Wasn’t
that aperfect setup forthelooters, Mr,Rearden? Only— whatone
single point didthey miss?'’
Rearden wasstaring athim.“What areyoudriving at?”
Francisco laughed suddenly, “It's toobadabout those profiteers
onRearden Metal. Youwouldn’t wantthem tolosethemoney you
made forthem, would you,Mr.Rearden? Butaccidents dohappen
intheworld—youknow what they say,man isonly ahelpless play-
thing attherneicy ofnature’s disasters. Forinstance, there wasa
tireatthed'Anconia oredocks inValparaiso tomorrow morning, a
tirethatrazed them totheground along with halfoftheport struc-
tures.What time isit,Mr.Rearden? Oh,did Imixmytenses? To-
morrow afternoon, there willbearock slide inthed’Anconia mines
atOrano- -no lives lost,nocasualties, except themines themselves.
Itwillbefound thatthemines aredone for.because theyhadbeen
worked inthewrong places formonths -what canyouexpect from
aplayboy’s management? Thegreat deposits ofcopper willbeburied
under tonsofmountain where aSebastian d'Anconia w'uuld notbe
able toreclaim them inlessthan three years, andaPeople’s State
willnever reclaim them atall.When thestockholders begin tolook
into things, they willfind thatthemines atCampos, atSan Felix, at
lasHeras havebeenworked inexactly thesamemanner andhave
been running ataloss forover ayear, only theplayboy juggled the
books andkept itoutofthenewspapers. Shalt Itellyouwhat they
willdiscover about themanagement otthed’Anconia foundries? Or
ofthed’Anconia ore fleet? But allthese discoveries won’t dothe
stockholders anygood anyway, because thestock ofd’Anconia Cop-
pciwallhave crashed tomorrow morning, crashed likeanelectric
bulb against concrete, crashed likeanexpress elevator, spattering
pieces ofhitchhikers allover thegutters!”
Thetriumphant riseotFrancisco's voice merged with amatching
sound Rearden burst outlaughing
Rearden didnotknowhowlong thatmoment lasted orwhat he
had felt, ithadbeen likeablow hurling him intoanother kind of
consciousness, then asecond blow returning himtohisown—allthat
was left, asattheawakening from anarcotic, wasthefeeling that
hehadknown someimmense kindoffreedom, never tobematched
inreality. Thiswas liketheWyatt fireagain, hethought, thiswas
liissecret danger.
Hefound himself backing away from Francisco d’Anconia. Fran-
cisco stood watching him intently andlooked as ifhehadbeen
watching him allthrough thatunknown length oftime.
“There arcnoevilthoughts, Mr.Rearden,” Francisco said softly,
except one: therefusal tothink.”
“No,” saidRearden; itwasalmost awhisper, heha<ltokeep his
voicedown, hewas afraid thathewould hear himself scream it,
‘no . .ifthis isthekeytoyou. no,don’t expect metocheer you .. .

Theboys inBuenos Aires andtheboys inSantiago willprobably

There’s stillagreat partofthed'Anconia Copper Company left,
though agreat partof itisgone forgood.Nobody willsaythat I’ve
done itintentionally. Youmay think whatyouwish.”
”1think you’re theguiltiest man inthisroom,” saidRearden qui-
etly. wearily; even the fireofhisanger wasgone; hefeltnothing but
theemptiness leftbythedeath ofagTeat hope. ”1think you’re
worse than anything 1hadsupposed. . ..”
Francisco looked athimwith astrange half-smile ofserenity, the
serenity ofavictory over pain, anddidnotanswer.
Itwas their silence that letthem hear thevoices ofthetwomen
whostood afewsteps away, andtheyturned tolook atthespeakers.
Thestocky, elderly manwasobviously abusinessman ofthecon-
scientious, unspectacular kind. Hisformal dress suitwasofgood
quality, butofacutfashionable twenty years before, withthefaintest
tinge ofgreen attheseams; hehadhadfewoccasions towear it.
Hisshirt studs were ostentatiously toolarge, but itwasthepathetic
ostentation ofanheirloom, intricate pieces ofold-fashioned work-
manship, thathadprobably come tohimthrough four generations,
like hisbusiness. Hisfacehadtheexpression which, these days, was
themark ofanhonest man; anexpression ofbewilderment. Hewas

hopelessly—tounderstand.
Hiscompanion wasyounger andshorter, asmallmanwithlumpy

Rearden glanced atFrancisco- andsawaface thatwentbeyond

itwasonly amoment. Francisco turned tohim, hisfacenormal,
andsaidvery quietly, “I’vechanged mymind, Mr.Rearden. I’mglad
thatyoucame tothisparty. 1wantyoutoseethis.”*
Then, raising hisvoice, Francisco saidsuddenly, inthfgay, loose,
piercing loneofamanofcomplete irresponsibility, “Yoi| won't grant
methat loan, Mr.Rearden? Itputsmeonaterrible fipot. 1must

Stock Exchange opens inthemorning, because otherwise—”
390
Hedidnothave tocontinue, because the littlemanwith themus-
tache wasclutching athisarm.
Rearden hadnever believed that ahuman body could change di-
mensions within one’s sight, buthesawthemanshrinking inweight,
inposture, inform, asiftheairwere letoutofhislungs, andwhat
hadbeenanarrogant rulerwassuddenly apiece ofscrap thatcould
notbeathreat toanyone.
“Is... isthere something wrong, Sehor d’Anconia‘>
Imean, on ...
ontheStock Exchange?"
Francisco jerked hisfinger tohisUps, with a(lightened glance.
“Keep quiet," hewhispered. "ForGod’s sake, keep quiet!”
Themanwasshaking. “Something’s ,. .wrong?"
“You don’t happen toownanyd’Anconia Copper stock, doyou?”
Themannodded, unable tospeak. “Ohmy, that’s toobad!Well

“Word ofhonor ..gasped theman.

Themanwasrunning across theroom, pushing people outofhis
way, likeatorpedo shot intothecrowd.
“Watch," saidFrancisco austerely, turning toReaidcn.
Themanwas lost inthecrowd, theycould notseehim; theycould
not telltowhom hewav selling hissecret orwhether hehadenough

buttheysawthewake ofhispassage spreading through theroom,
thesudden cuts splitting thecrowd, likethe firstfewcracks, then
liketheaccelerating branching thatruns through awallabout to
crumble, thestreaks ofemptiness slashed, notbvahuman touch,
butbytheimpersonal breath ofterror.
There were thevoices abruptly choked off.thepools ofsilence,
thensounds ofadifferent nature, the rising, hysterical inflections of
uselessly repeated questions, theunnatural whispers, awoman’s
sciearn, thefewspaced, forced giggles ofthose stilltrying topretend
thatnothing washappening.
There were spots ofimmobility inthemotion ofthecrowd, like
spreading blotches ofparalysis; there wasasudden stillness, asifa

James Taggart* hisfaceindecent initsexposure ofemotions which

andscreamed, "Is ittrue?’'
"Why, James/* said Francisco* smiling, ‘"what’s thematter? Why

Taggart rantoward themain exit, yelling something toOrren

eagerness andhumility ofaninefficient servant, then darted offin

"Jim, what’s thematter?" Hepushed heraside andshe fellagainst

It’srunning out,thought Reardon—butheanswered, “Idon’t

Shemade atightening, sidewise movement withher Jips.theequiv-

Hestood atthewindow, looking down atthestreaming roofs of

hisliving room remained ontheedge othisvision, sothesense of

wastheteeling ofreluctance toundress inthepresence ofastrange

Lillian came out, astrimly groomed asshehadarrived, thebeige

Hereached over mechanically andtook thesuitcase outofher

“Like this?Youhaven't changed your clothes.”

Hedidnotanswer, butwalked tothedoor, held itopen forher

They remained silentwhen they rodemataxicab tothestation.
Atsuchmoments asheremembered herpresence, henoticed that
she satefficiently straight, almost flaunting theperfection ofher
poise; sheseemed alertly awake andcontented, asifshewere starting
outonapurposeful journey ofearly morning.
Thecabstopped attheentrance totheTaggart Terminal. The
bright lights Hooding thegreat glassdoorway transformed thelate-
ness ofthehour into asense ofactive, timeless security. Lillian
jumped lightly outofthecab, saying, “No, no,youdon’t have to

‘i’lltelephone you,” hesaid.
Shewaved hergloved hand athimanddisappeared intothelights

Theapartment wasdarkwhen heentered, butthedoor toher

Hewalked in,asking. “Were youasleep?”
“No.”
Heswitched onthe light. She layinbed,herheadpropped bythe
pillow, herhair falling smoothly tohershoulders, asifshehadnot

aschoolgirl, with thetailored collar ofapalebluenightgown lying

thatlooked luxuriously adult andfeminine.

Hesatdown ontheedge ofthebed—andshesmiled, noticing
thatthestern formality ofhisfulldress clothes made hisaction so
simply, naturally intimate. Hesmiled inanswer. Hehadcome, pre-
pared toreject theforgiveness shehadgranted him attheparty, as
one rejects afavor from toogenerous anadversary. Instead, he
reached outsuddenly andmoved hishand over herforehead, down
thelineofher hair, inagesture ofprotective tenderness, inthe
sudden feeling ofhow delicately childlike shewas, thisadversary
whohadborne theconstant challenge ofhisstrength, butwhoshould
havehad hisprotection.
“You're carrying somuch," hesaid,“and it’s Iwhomake itharder

“No,Hank, youdon't andyouknow it.”
“Iknow thatyouhave thestrength nottolet ithurtyou. but it's

Hesaid itsternly, without emotion, asanimpersonal verdict upon

pressed ittoher lips,andshook herhead inrejection oftheverdict,
holding herfacehidden against hishand.
“What doyammean?” heasked softly.

Shechuckled, stretching, rubbing hershoulder blades against the

asked. “Ifaman likeyou stays pure asamonk forover ayear,

Somewhere outside ofhimand apart, asifhewere reading itin

Entering Reardon’s office. Dr.Floyd Ferris wore theexpression
ofamansocertain ofthesuccess othisquest thathecould afford
abenevolent smile.Hespoke with asmooth, cheerful assurance;
Rearden hadtheimpression that itwastheassurance ofacardsharp
whohasspent aprodigious effort inmemorizing every possible varia-
tionofthepattern, and isnow safe intheknowledge thatevery card
inthedeck ismarked.
“Well, Mr.Rearden.” hesaid,bywayofgreeting, ‘Tdidn’t know
thateven ahardened hound ofpublic functions andshaker <>ffamous
hands, likemyself, could stillgetathrill outofmeeting aneminent
man, butthat’s what Ifeel rightnow, believe itornot,”
“How doyoudo,” saidRearden.
Dr.Ferris satdown andmade afewremarks about th$colors of
theleaves inthemonth ofOctober, ashehadobserved thffcm bythe
400
roadside onhislong drive fromWashington, undertaken specifically
forthepurpose ofmeeting Mr.Rearden inperson. Rearden said
nothing. Dr.Ferris looked outthewindow andcommented onthe
inspiring sight oftheRearden mills which, hesaid,wereoneofthe
most valuable productive enterprises inthecountry.
‘That isnotwhatyouthought ofmyproduct ayearand ahalf
ago," saidRearden.
Dr.Ferris gave abrief frown, asifadotofthepattern hadslipped
andalmost costhimthegame, thenchuckled, asifhehadrecaptured
it.“That wasayearandahalfago,Mr.Rearden," hesaid easily.
“Times change, andpeople change with thetimes—thewiseones
do.Wisdom liesinknowing when toremember andwhen toforget.
Consistency isnotahabit ofmind which itiswise topractice orto
expect ofthehuman race."
Hethenproceeded todiscourse upon thetoolishness ofcoasts*
tency inaworld where nothing wasabsolute except theprinciple of
compromise. Hetalked earnestly, butinacasual manner, asifboth
understood that thiswasnotthemain subject oftheir interview; yet,
oddly, hespoke not inthetone ofaforeword, but inthetone ofa
postscript, asifthemain subject hadbeen settled long ago.
Rearden waited forthe first"Don't youthink so?"andanswered,
“Please state theurgent matter forwhich yourequested thisap-
pointment.''
Dr.Feiris looked astonished andblank foramoment, then said
brightly, asifremembering anunimportant subject which could be
disposed ofwithout effort, “Oh. that? Thatwas inregard tothe
dates ofdelivery ofRearden Metal totheState Science Institute.
Weshould liketohave fivethousand tonsbythe firstofDecember,
andthenwe llbequite agreeable towaiting forthebalance ofthe
order until after the firstoftheyear/'
Rearden satlooking athim silently foralong time; each passing
moment hadtheeffect ofmaking thegayintonations ofDr.Ferris’
voice, stillhanging intheairoftheroom, seemmore foolish. When
Dr.Ferris hadbegun todread thathewould notanswer atall.
Rearden answered, “Hasn’t thetraflic copwith theleather leggings,
whom yousent here, given youareport onhisconversation with
me?"
“Why, yes,Mr.Rearden. but—"
“What elsedoyouwant tohear?"
“But thatwas fivemonths ago,Mr.Rearden. Acertain event has
taken place since, which makesmequite sure thatyouhavechanged
yourmind and thatyou willmake notrouble forusatall,just as
wewillmake notrouble foryou,"
“What event?"
“Anevent ofwhich youhave fargreater knowledge than l—but,
yousee, 1dohaveknowledge of it,even though youwould much
prefermetohave none."
“What event?"
“Since itisyour secret, Mr.Rearden, why not let itremain a
secret?Who doesn’t have secrets nowadays? Forinstance. ProjectX
isasecret. You realize, ofcourse, thatwecould obtain yourMetal
401
simply byhaving itpurchased insmaller quantities byvarious gov-
ernment offices whowould then transfer ittous—andyouwould
notbeable toprevent it*But thiswould necessitate ourletting alot
oflousy bureaucrats" —Dr.Ferris smiled withdisarming frankness—
“oh yes,weareasunpopular withoneanother aswearewithyou
private citizens— itwould necessitate our letting alotofother bu-
reaucrats inonthesecret ofProject X,which would behighly unde-
sirable atthistimeAnd sowould anynewspaper publicity about
theProject—ifweputyouon trial forrefusal tocomply with a
government order. But ifyouhad tostand trialonanother, much
more serious charge, where Project XandtheState Science Institute
were notinvolved, andwhere youcould notraiseanyissue ofprinci-
pleorarouse anypublic sympathy—why, thatwould notinconve-
nience usatall,but itwould costyoumore thanyouwould care to
contemplate. Therefore, theonly practical thing foryoutodoisto
help uskeepoursecret andgetustohelpyoukeep yours—and, as
I’msureyourealize, wearefully able tokeepanyofthebureaucrats
safely oftyour trail foraslong aswewish."
“What event, what secret andwhat trail?"
“Oh, come, Mr.Rearden, don’t bechildish! The tourthousand
tons ofRearden Metal which youdelivered toKenDanaggei, of
course,” saidDr.Ferris lightly.
Rearden didnotanswer.
“Issues ofprinciple aresuch anuisance," saidDr.Ferris, smiling,
“and such awaste otlime for allconcerned. Nowwould youcare
tobeamartyt foranissue ofprinciple, onlymciiciimMances where
nobody willknow that that’s what youare -nobody butyouand

ofmartyr? Because that’s justwhat theissueamounts tonow' either
you letushave theMetal oryougotojailfortenyears andtake
your friend Danagger along, too."
Asabiologist. DrFerris hadalways been fascinated bythetheory
thatanimals hadthecapacity tosmell fear,hehad tried todevelop
asimilar capacity inhimself. Watching Rearden, heconcluded that
themanhadlong since decided togive in—because heCaught no
tTacc ofany fear.
“Who wasyour informer?” asked Rearden.
“One ofyour friends. Mr.Rearden. Theowner ofacopper mine
inArizona, who reported tousthatyouhadpurchased anextra
amount ofcopper lastmonth, above theregular tonnagd required
forthemonthly quota ofRearden Metal which thelawpermits you
toproduce. Copper isoneoftheingredients ofRearden Metal, isn't
402
it?Thaiwas alltheinformation weneeded. The restwaseasy to
trace.You mustn't blame thatmineowner toomuch. Thecopper
producers, asyouknow, arebeing squeezed sobadly rightnow that
themanhadtooffersomething ofvalue inorder toobtain afavor,
an‘emergency need’ ruling which suspended afewofthedirectives
inhiscaseandgavehimalittle breathing spell.Theperson towhom
hetraded hisinformation knew where itwould have thehighest
value, sohetraded ittome. inreturn forcertain favors heneeded.
Soallthenecessary evidence, aswell asthenext tenyears ofyour
life,arenow inmypossession—and Iamoffering youatrade. I’m
sureyouwon’t object, since trade isyour specialty. Theformmay
bealittle different from what itwas inyour youth—butyou're a
smart trader, you’ve always known how totakeadvantage ofchang-
ingconditions, andthese aretheconditions ofourday,soitshould
notbedifficult foryou toseewhere your interests lieandtoact
accordingly.”
Rcarden saidcalmly, "Inmyyouth, thiswascalled blackmail.”
Dr.Ferris grinned, "that’s what itis,Mr.Reardon. We’ve entered
amuchmote icaUstic age.”.
Butthere wasapeculiar difference, thought Rcarden, between the
manner ofaplain blackmailer andthat ofDr.Ferris.Ablackmailer
would show signs ofgloating over hisvictim’s sinandofacknowledg-
ing itsevil,hewould suggest athieat tothevictim andasense of
danger tothem both. Dr.Ferris conveyed none of it.Hismanner
wasthat ofdealing with thenormal andthenatural, itsuggested a
sense ofsafety, ifheldnotoneofcondemnation, butahintofcom-
radeship. acomradeship based— forboth ofthem-onseif-contempt.
Thesudden feeling thatmade Rcarden leanforward inapostpre of
eager attentiveness, wasthetooling thathewasabout todiscover
another stepalong hishalfglimpsed trail.
Seeing Rearden’s look ofinterest. Dr.Ferns smiled andcongratu-
lated himself onhaving caught theright key.Thegame wasdear to
himnow, themarkings ofthepattern were tailing intheright order;
some men, thought Dr.Ferns, would doanything solong asitwas
leftunnamed, but thismanwanted frankness, thiswasthetough
realist hehadexpected tofind.
"You’re apractical man, Mr.Rcarden,” saidDr,Ferris amiably,
"1can’t understand whyyoushould want tostaybehind thetimes.
Why don’t youadjust yourself andplay itright? You're smarter than
most ofthem. You're avaluable person, we've wanted you fora
long time, andwhen Iheard thatyouwere trying tostring along

doing business. Askyourself which way ismore practical. Andwhat-
ever anyone’s saidabout you,nobody’s everdenied thatyou’re a
great businessman and ahard-headed realist.”
“That’s what Iam,” saidRearden.
“That’s what Ithought,” said Dr. Ferris. “You rose toriches in
anagewhen mostmenwere going bankrupt, you've always managed
toblast obstacles, tokeep your mills going and tomakemoney—
that’s your reputation—soyouwouldn’t want tobeimpractical now,
would you?What for?What doyou care, solong asyoumake
money? Leave thetheories topeople likeBertram Scudder andthe
ideals topeople likeBalph Eubank—andbeyourself. Come down
toearth. You’re notthemanwho’d leisentiment interfere with
business.”
“No,” saidRearden slowly, “1wouldn't Notanykind ofsenti-
ment.”
Dr.Ferris smiled. “Don't yousuppose weknew it?”hesaid, his
tone suggesting thathewas letting hispatent-leather hairdown to
impress afellow criminal byadisplay ofsuperior cunning. “We've
waited along time togetsomething onyou.Youhonest men arc
such aproblem andsuch aheadache. Butweknew you’d slipsooner
orlater—and this isjustwhatwewanted.”
“You seem tobepleased about it”
“Don't 1havegood reason tobe9”
“But, after all, Ididbreak oneofyour taws.”
“Well, whatdoyouthink they're for?”
Dr.Ferris didnotnotice thesudden lookonReardon’s lace, the
lookofaman. hitbythe firstvision ofthatwhich hehadsought to
see.Dr.Ferris waspast thestage ofseeing: hewas intent upon
delivering thelastblows toananimal caught inatrap.
“Did you really think thatwewant those laws tobeobserved?”
saidDr.Ferris.“Wewantthem broken. You’d better get itstraight
that it’snotabunch ofboyscouts you’re upagainst— then you’ll
know that this isnottheage forbeautiful gestures. We're after
power andwemean it.You fellows were pikers, butweknow the

Rearden. that’s thegame, andonce youunderstand it,]

Watching Dr.Ferris watch him,Rearden sawthesudtjen twitch
ofanxiety, thelook thatprecedes panic, asifaclean card jtad fallen
onthetable from adeck Dr.Ferris hadnever seen before.m
What Dr.Ferris wasseeing inRearden '$facewasthelook of
luminous serenity thatcomes from thesudden answer toanold,dark
problem, alook ofrelaxation andeagerness together; there was a
youthful clanty inRearden’s eyesandthefaintest touch ofcontempt
inthelineofhismouth. Whatever thismeant—andDr.Ferris could
notdecipher it—hewascertain ofone thing: thefaceheldnosign
ofguilt.
“There’s aHaw inyour system. Dr.Ferris,*' Reardon said quietly,
almost tightly, “apractical Hawwhich you willdiscover when you
putmeontrial torselling fourthousand tonsofReaidcn Metal to
KenDanagger.”
Ittook twenty seconds—Kcarden could fedthem moving past
slowly- -attheendofwhich Dr.Ferris became convinced thathe
hadheard Reardon's final decision.
“Doyouthink we’re bluffing'*” snapped Dr.Ferris: hisvoice sud-
denly hadthequality ottheanimals hehadspent somuch time
studying* itsounded asifhewere baring histeeth.
“Idon’t know,” saidRearden. “1don’t care, onewayorthe
other.”
“Are yougoing toheasimpractical asthat?”
“The evaluation ofanaction as‘practical,* Dr.Ferris, depends on
what itisthatonewishes topractice.”
“Haven’t youalways placed your self-interest above allelse?”
“1hat iswhat Iamdoing lightnow”
“Ifyouthinkwe llletyougetaway with a—”
“You willnowplease getoutofhere”
“Whom doyouthink you’re fooling?” Dr.Ferris’ voice hadrisen
dose totheedge ofascream. “Thedayofthebarons ofindustry is
done! You've gotthegoods, butwe've gotthegoods onyou,and
you're going toplay itourwayoryou'll—”
Rearden hadpressed abutton; Miss Ivesentered theoffice.
“Dr. Ferris hasbecome confused andhaslost hisway.Miss Ives,”
saidRearden: “Witt you escort him out,please?” Heturned to
Ferris “Miss Ives isawoman, sheweighs about ahundred pounds,
andshehasnopractical qualifications atall.only asuperlative intel-
lectual efficiency. Shewould never doforabouncer inasaloon,
only inanimpractical place, such asafactory.”
Mis.s Iveslooked asdshewere performing aduty ofnogreater
emotional significance than taking dictation about alistofshipping
invoices. Standing straight inadisciplined manner oficyformality,
sheheld thedoor open, letDr.Ferris cross theroom, thenwalked
out first; Dr,Ferris followed.
Shecame back alewminutes later, laughing inuncontrollable
exultation.
“Mr. Rearden,” sheasked, laughing atherfear forhim, attheir
danger, ateverything butthetriumph ofthemoment, “what isit

“Mr. Danaggei willbefiee inamoment. Miss Taggart. Hehasa
visitor inhisoffice. Willyouexcuse it.please?’* said thesecretary.
Through thetwohours ofherllight toPittsburgh. Dagny hadbeen
tensely unable tojustify heranxietv ortodismiss it;there wasno
reason tocount minutes, yetshehad felt ablind desire tohurry.
Theanxiety vanished when sheentered theanteroom ofKenDanag-
ger’s office: shehadreached him. nothing hadhappened toprevent
it,she feltsafety, confidence andanenormous sense ofrelief
Thewords ofthesecretary demolished it.You’re becoming acow-
ard—thought Dagnv, feeling acauseless jolt otdread atthewords,
outofaltproportion totheirmeaning.
“1amsosorry. Miss Taggart.’’ Sheheard thesecretary’s respectful,
solicitous voiceandrealized thatshehadstood there without answer-
ing.“Mr. Danagger willbewithyou injust amoment. Won’t you
sitdown?” Thevoice conveyed ananxious concern over theimpro-
priety ofkeeping herwaiting.
Dagnv smiled. “Oh, that's quite allright”
She satdown inawooden armchair, facing thesecretary’s failing.
Shereached foracigarette andstopped, wondering whether she
would have time tofinish it,hoping thatshewould not.then lighted
itbrusquely
Itwasanold-fashioned frame building, thisheadquarters ofthe
great Danagger CoalCompany. Somewhere inthe hillsbeyond the
window were thepitswhere KenDanagger hadonceworked asa
miner. Hehadnevermoved hisoffice awav from thecoal fields.
Shecould seethemine entrances cutinto the hillsides, small
frames ofmetal girders, that ledtoanimmense underground king-
dom.Theyseemed precariously modest, lost intheviolent orange
andredofthe hills. . . .Under aharsh blue sky, inthesunlight of
lateOctober, theseaofleaves looked likeaseaoffire .like
waves rolling toswallow thefragile posts olthemine doorways. She
shuddered andlooked away: shethought oftheflaming leaves spread
over the hillsofWisconsin, ontheroad toStarnesville.
Shenoticed thattherewasonlyastub leftofthecigarette between
herfingers. Shelighted another.
When sheglanced attheclock onthewalloftheantdruom, she
caught thesecretary glancing atitatthesame time.Herappointment
wasforthree o’clock; thewhite dial said: 3:12.
;
“Please forgive it.MissTaggart," saidthesecretary, “tylr,Danag-
gerwillbethrough, anymoment now Mr.Danagger isextremely
408
punctual about hisappointments. Please believe methat this is
unprecedented.”
"Iknow it.”Sheknew thatKenDanagger wasasrigidly exact
about hisschedule asarailroad timetable and thathehadbeen
known tocancel aninterview ifacaller permitted himself toarrive
liveminutes late.
Thesecretary wasanelderly spinster with aforbidding manner: a
manner ofeven-toned courtesy impervious toanyshock, justasher
spotless white blouse wasimpervious toanatmosphere tilled with
coal dust.Dagny thought itstrange that ahardened, well-trained
woman ofthistype should appear tobenervous: shevolunteered
noconversation, she sat still,bentoversome pages ofpaper onher
desk. Half ofDagny's cigarette hadgone insmoke, while thewoman
still satlooking atthesame page.
When sheraised herhead toglance atthedock, thedial said:
V.tO. “Iknow that this isinexcusable, Miss Taggart." Thenote of
apprehension wasobvious inhervoice now. iamunable tounder-
stand it.”
“Would youmind telling Mi.Danagger thatI’mhere?”
“Ican't'" Itwasalmost acry;shesawDagny’s astonished glance
and leftobliged toexplain; "Mr.Danagger called me.ontheinterof-
ficecommunicator, and toldmethathewasnottobeinterrupted
under anycircumstances ortoranyreason whatever."
“When didhedothat?"
Themoment’s pause was like asmall aircushion fortheanswer:
“lwohours ago.”
Dagny looked attheclosed door ofDanagger ‘soffice. Shecould
hear thesound ofavoice beyond thedoor, butsofaintly thatshe
could not tellwhether itwasthevoice ofonemanortheconversa-
tionoftwo;shecould notdistinguish thewords ortheemotional
quality ofthetone, itwasonly alow,even progression ofsounds
thatseemed normal anddidnotconvey thepitch ofraised voices.
“How longhasMrDanagger been inconference?" sheasked.
“Since oneo’clock," saidthesecretary grimly, thenadded inapol-
ogy. ‘itwasanunscheduled caller, orMr.Danagger would never
havepermuted thistohappen"
Thedoorwasnotlocked, thought Dagny, she feltanunreasoning
desire totear itopen andwalk in- -itwasonly afewwooden boards
andabrass knob, itwould require only asmall muscular contraction
ofherarm— butshelooked away, knowing that thepower ofa
civilized order and ofKenDanagger’s rightwasmore impregnable
abanter thananylock.
Shefound herself staring atthestubs ofheicigarettes intheash-
traystand beside her,andwondered why itgave herasharper feeling
ofapprehension, then sherealized thatshewasthinking ofHugh
Akston: shehadwritten tohim. athisdiner inWyoming, asking him
totellherwheie hehadobtained thecigarette with thedollar sign;
herletter hadcome back, with apostal inscription toinform her
thathehadmoved away, leaving noforwarding address.
Shetoldherself angnly that thishadnoconnection with thepres-
entmoment andthatshehadtocontrol hernerves. Butherhand
409
jerked topress thebutton oftheashtray andmake thecigarette
stubs vanish inside thestand.
Asshelooked up,hereyesmettheglance ofthesecretary watch-
ingher. “Iamsorry. Miss Taggart. Idon'tknow what todoabout
it.*' Itwasanopenly desperate plea. “Idon’t dare interrupt/'
Dagny asked slowly, asademand, indefiance ofoffice etiquette,
“Who iswithMr.Danagger?'’
“1don't know. Miss Taggart. Ihave never Seen thegentleman
before/' Shenoticed thesudden, fixed stillness ofDagny’s eyesand
added. “Jthink it’sachildhood friend ofMr.Danagger."
“Oh!" saidDagny, relieved,
“Hecame inunannounced andasked toseeMr.Danagger and
said that thiswasanappointment which Mr.Danagger hadmade
withhimforty years ago"
“How old isMr.Danagger?"
“Fifty-two." saidthesecretary Sheadded reflectively, inthetone
ofacasual remark, “Mr. Danagger started working attheageof
twelve." After another silence, sheadded, “The strange thing isthat
thevisitor does notlook asifhe’seven forty years old.Heseems
tobeaman inhisthirties"
“Did hegive hisname?"
“No."
“What does helook like?"
Thesecretary smiled withsudden animation, as ilshewere about
toutter anenthusiastic compliment, butthesmile vanished abruptly.
“Idon’t know." sheanswered uneasily. “He’s hard todescribe. He
hasastrange face."
They hadbeen silent foralong time, andthehands ofthedial
were approaching 3:50when thebuzzer rang onthesecretary's
desk—thebellfrom Danaggcr’s office, thesignal ofpermission to
enter.
They both leaped totheir feet,andthesecretary rushed forward,
smiling with, relief, hastening toopen thedoor.
Assheentered Danagger soffice, Dagny sawtheprivate exitdoor
dosing after thecallerwhohadpreceded herSheheard theknock
ofthedoor against thejamb andthefaint tinkle oftheglass panel.
Shesawthemanwhohad left,byhisreflection onKenDanagger’s
face. Itwasnotthefaceshehadseen inthecourtroom, itwasnot
thefaceshehadknown foryears asacountenance ofunchanging,
unfeeling rigidity— itwasafacewhich ayoung manoftwenty should
hope for.butcould notachieve, afacefrom which every sign of
strain hadbeen wiped out,sothat thelined cheeks, thecreased
forehead, thegraying hair— likeelements rearranged byanew
theme—weremade toform acomposition ofhope, eagerness and
guiltless serenity: thetheme wasdeliverance.
Hedidnot risewhen sheentered—helooked asiftoehadnot
quite returned tothereality ofthemoment andhadforgotten the
proper routine—buthesmiled atherwithsuch simple bdnevolence
thatshefound herself smiling inanswer. Shecaught herself thinking
that thiswasthewayeveryhuman being should greet andther—and
410
she lostheranxiety, feeling suddenly certain that allwaswelland
thatnothing tobefeared could exist,
“How doyoudo.Miss Taggart,” hesaid, “Forgive me, Ithink
that 1have keptyouwaiting. Please sitdown.” Hepointed tothe
chair infront ofhisdesk,Tdidn't mind waiting," shesaid.“I’m grateful thatyougaveme
thisappointment, iwasextremely anxious tospeak toyouona
matter ofurgent importance.”
Heleaned forward across thedesk, with alook ofattentive con-
centration, ashealways didatthemention ofanimportant business
matter, butshewasnotspeaking totheman sheknew, thiswasa
stranger, andshestopped, uncertain about thearguments shehad
been prepared touse.
Helooked atherinsilence, andthenhesaid.“Miss Taggart, this
issuch abeautiful day— probably the last, thisyear. There's athing
I'vealways wanted todo,butnever hadtime for it.I^et’s goback
toNewYork together andtakeone olthose excursion boat trips
around theisland ofManhattan. Lei's take alastlook, atthegreatest
city intheworld.”
She sat still, trying tohold hereyes fixed inorder tostop the
office from swaying, thiswastheKenDanagger whohadnever had
personal friend, hadnever married, hadnever attended aplayor
,1movie, hadnever permitted anyone theimpertinence oftaking his
time foranyconcern butbusiness,
"Mi Danagger, 1came heie tospeak toyouabout amatter of
crucial importance tothefuture ofyour business andmine. Icame
tospeak toyouabout your indictment.”
"Oh, that? Don’t worry about that. Itdoesn’t matter. I’mgoing
toretire."
She sat still, feeling nothing, wondering numbly whether thiswas
how itfelttoheai adeath sentence onehaddreaded, buthadnever
quite believed possible
Her firstmovement wasasudden jerkofherheadtoward theexit
dooi. sheasked, hervoice low,hermouth distorted byhatred. "Who

Danagger laughed, ‘ifyou've guessed thatmuch, youshould have
guessed that it’saquestion 1won't answer”
“OhGod,KenDanagger!" shemoaned, hiswords made herreal-
izethatthebarriei ofhopelessness, ofsilence, ofunanswered ques-
tionswasalready erected between them: thehatred hadbeen only
athinwire thathadheld herforamoment andshebroke with its
breaking. "OhGod!"
"You’re wrong, kid," hesaid gently. "Iknowhowyoufed,but
you're wtong.” thenadded more formally, asifremembering the
proper manner, asifstilltrying tobalance himself between twokinds
ofreality, "I'm sorry. Miss Taggart, thatyouhad tocome here so

“You did?That’s funny. Ididn’t.”
“Iwanted towarn you, to .. .toarmyouagainst him.”
Hesmiled. 'Takemyword for it.Miss Taggatt, sothatyouwon’t
torture yourself with regrets about thetiming: thatcould nothave
been done.”
She feltthatwithevery passing minute hewasmoving away into
some great distance where shewould notbeable toreach him. but
there was stillsome thinbridge leftbetween them andshehadto
hurry. Sheleaned forward, shesaid very quietly, theintensity of
emotion taking form intheexaggerated steadiness ofhervoice,“Do
youremember whatyouthought and felt,whatyouwere, three hours
ago?Doyouremember what yourmines meant toyou?Doyou
remember Taggart Transcontinental orReardon Steel? Inthename
ofthat, willyouanswer me? Willyouhelpmetounderstand?"
“Iwillanswer whatever 1may."
“You havedecided toretire? Togiveupyour business0”
“Yes.”
“Does itmean nothing toyounow?"
“Itmeans more tomenowthan itever didbetore.”
“But you're going toabandon it?"
“Yes"
“Why?"
“That. Iwon’t answer."
“You. who loved your work, who respected nothing butwork,
whodespised every kind ofaimlessness, passivity andrenunciation ~

"No. Ihave justdiscovered howmuch Idolove it"
“Butyouintend toexist without work orpurpose?"
“What makes youthink that?"
“Are yougoing intothecoal-mining business somewhere else0"
"No, notintothecoal-mining business."
“Then what areyougoing todo?”
“Ihaven’t decided that vet."
“Where areyougoing?”
“1won’t answer."
Shegave herself amoment’s pause, togather herstrength, totell
herself: Don’t feel, don’t showhim thatyou feelanything, don’t let
itcloud andbreak thebridge—then shesaid, inthesame quiet, even
voice.“Doyou realize what your retirement willdotoHank Rear-
den, tome,toailtherestofus,whoever isleft?"
“Yes. Irealize itmore fullythanyoudoatpresent."
“And itmeans nothing toyou?"
“Itmeans more thanyou willcare tobelieve”
“Then whyareyoudeserting us?”
“You willnotbelieve itand 1willnotexplain, but 1amnotde-

“We’re being lefttocarry agreater burden, andyou're indifferent
totheknowledge that you’ll seeusdestroyed bythelooters.”
“Don’t betoosureofthat.”
“Ofwhich? Your indifference orourdestruction?”
“Of either.”

‘‘Butyouknow, youknew itthismorning, that it’sabattle tothe

“If 1answer that lknow it,butyoudon’t—you’ll think that I

‘"Will you tellmethemeaning?”
“No. It’sforyoutodiscover.”
“You’re willing togiveuptheworld tothelooters. Wearen’t”
“Don’t betoosureofeither.”
Sheremained helplessly silent. Thestrangeness ofhismanner was
itssimplicity: hespoke asifhewere being completely natural and—
inthemidst ofunanswered questions andofatragic mystery—he
conveyed theimpression thatthere werenosecrets anylonger, and
nomystery need everhave existed.
Butasshewatched him,shesawthe firstbreak inhisjoyous calm:
shesawhimstruggling against some thought; hehesitated, then said,
with effort, “About Hank Reardon ..Willyoudomeafavor?”
“Ofcourse.”
“Will you tellhimthat I . ..You see. I’venever cared forpeople,

“I’ll tellhim.”
Hearing thedulled, hidden sound ofpain inhisvoice, she feltso
close tohimthat itseemed impossible hewould deliver theblow he

“Mr Danaggcr, it Iwere toplead onmyknees, if Iwere tohnd

“There isn’t.”
After amoment, sheasked tonelcssly, “When areyouquitting?”

There wasonly afaint redbreath above thestructures inthe
darkness, asifthemillswere asleep butalive, with theeven breath-
ingofthefurnaces andthedistant heartbeats oftheconveyor belts
toshow it.Reardon stood atthewindow ofhisoffice, hishand
pressed tothepane; intheperspective ofdistance, hishand covered
half amileofstructures, asifhewere trying toholdthem.
Hewaslooking atalong wall ofvertical strips, which wasthe
battery ofcoke ovens.Anarrow door slidopen withabrief gasp of
(lame, andasheet ofred-glowing cokecame sliding outsmoothly,
likeaslice ofbread from thesideofagiant toaster. Itheld stillfor
aninstant, thenanangular aack shotthrough thesliceand itcrum-
bled intoagondola waiting onthe railsbelow
Danagger coal, hethought These were theonlywords inhismind.
The restwasafeeling ofloneliness, sovast thateven itsown pain
seemed swallowed inanenormous void.
Yesterday, Dagnv hadtoldhimthestory ofherfutile attempt and
given himDanagger's message Ibismorning, hehadheard thenews
thatDanagger haddisappeared Through hissleepless night, then
through thetautconcentration ontheduties oftheday, hisanswer
tothemessage hadkept beating inhismind, theanswer hewould
never have achance toutter.
‘1heonlyman Iever loved.” Itcame fromKenDanaggci, who
hadnever expressed anything more personal than’‘Look here. Rear-
den.”Hethought. Whyhadwe let ttgo?Why hadwebothbeen
condemned -inthehours away Irom ouidesks-— toanexileamong
dreary strangers whohadmade usgiveupalldesire forrest, for
friendship, forthesound olhuman voices? Could Inow reclaim a
single hour spent listening tomybrother Philip andgive ittoKen
Danagger? Whomade itourduty toaccept, astheonlyreward for
ourwork, thegray torture ofpretending love forthosewhoroused
ustonothing butcontempt? Wewhowere able tomelt rockand
metal forourpurpose, whyhadwenever sought thatwhich we
wanted from men'*
Hetried tochoke thewords inhismind, knowing that itwas
useless tothink ofthem now. Butthewords were there andthey
were likewords addressed tothedead: No, Idon'tdamn you for
leaving- ilthat isthequestion andthepamwhich youtookaway
withyou.Why didn't yougivemeachance totellyou . . .what? that
1approve? . , .no,butthat Icanneither blame younorfollow you,
(losing hiseyes,hepermitted himself toexperience foramoment
theimmense relief hewould feel ifhe,too,were towalk off,aban-
doning everything Under theshock ofhisloss,hefeltathinthread
ofenvy.Why didn’t theycome forme,too,whoever they are,and
givemethat irresistible reason which would makemego?But in
thenextmoment, hisshudder ofanger toldhimthathewould mur-
415
dcrthemanwho’d attempt toapproach him,hewould murder be-
forehecould hear thewords ofthesecret thatwould takehimaway
from hismills.
Itwas late, hisstaffhadgone, buthedreaded theroad tohis
house andtheemptiness oftheevening ahead. He feltas ifthe
enemy whohadwiped outKenDanagger were waiting forhim in
thedarkness beyond theglow ofthemills.Hewasnotinvulnerable
anylonger, butwhatever itwas.hethought, wherever itcame from,
hewassafefrom ithere, asinacircle oftiresdrawn about himto
ward offevil.
Helooked attheglittering white splashes onthedarkwindows of
astructure inthedistance; theywere likemotionless ripples ofsun-
lightonwater. Itwasthereflection oftheneon sign thatburned on
theroofofthebuilding above hishead, saying: Rearden Steel.He
thought ofthenightwhen hehadwished tolight asignabove his
past, saying: Rearden Life.Whyhadhewished it?Forwhose eyes
tosee?
Hethought—inbitter astonishment and forthe firsttime—that
thejoyous pride hehadonce felt,hadcome from hisrespect for
men, forthevalue oftheir admiration and theirjudgment. Hedid
not feel itanylonger. There werenomen, hethought, towhose
sighthecould wish tooffer that sign.
Heturned brusquely awav from thewindow. Heseized hisover-
coatwith theharsh sweep ofagesture intended tojolthimback
intothediscipline ofaction. Heslammed thetwofolds oftheover-
coatabout hisbody, hejerked thebelt tight, thenhastened toturn
offthelights withrapid snaps ofhishandonhiswayoutoftheoffice.
Hethrew thedooropen—andstopped. Asingle lampwasburn-
inginacorner ofthedimmed anteroom, lhemanwho satonthe
edge ofadesk, inapose ofcasual, patient waiting, wasFrancisco
d’Ancon la
Rearden stood stillandcaught abrief instant when Francisco, not
moving, loojced athimwith thehintofanamused smile thatwas
likeawinkbetween conspirators atasecret theyboth understood,
butwould notacknowledge. Itwasonlyaninstant, almost loobrief
togTasp, because itseemed tohimthatFrancisco rose atonce athis
entrance, withamovement ofcourteous deference. Themovement
suggested astrict formality, thedenial ofanyattempt atpresump-
tion—but itstressed theintimacy ofthefactthatheuttered noword
ofgreeting orexplanation.
Rearden asked, hisvoice hard,“What areyoudoing here?0
“Ithought thatyouwould want toseemetonight, MrRearden”
“Why?”
“For thesame reason thathaskeptyousotale inyour office. You
were notworking.”
“How longhaveyoubeen sitting here?”
“Anhour ortwo.”
“Why didn’t youknock atmydoor?”
“Would youhave allowed metocome in?”
“YouYelate inasking thatquestion.”
“Shall 1leave, Mr.Rearden?”
416
Rearden pointed tothedoor ofhisoffice.“Come in.”
Turning thelights onintheoffice, moving withunhurried control.
Rearden thought thathemust notallow himself tofecianything, but
feltthecolor offifereturning tohim inthetensely quiet eagerness of
anemotion which hewould notidentify. What hetoldhimself con-
sciously was:Becareful.
Hesatdown ontheedge ofhisdesk, crossed hisarms, looked at
Francisco, whoremained standing respectfully before him,andasked
with thecold hintofasmile,“Why didyoucome here?”
“You don’t wantmetoanswer, Mr.Rearden. Youwouldn't admit
tomeortoyourself howdesperately lonely youaretonight, ffyou
don’t question me,youwon’t teclobliged todeny it.Just accept
whatyoudoknow, anyway: that Iknow it.”
Taut likeastring pulled byanger against theimpertinence atone
endandbyadmiration forthefrankness attheother, Rearden an-
swered, “I'lladmit it,ifyouwishWhat should itmatter tome,that
youknow it?”
“That 1know and care. Mi.Rearden. I’mtheonlymanaround
youwhodoes.”
“Why should you care? Andwhy should Ineed your help
tonight?”
“Because it'snoteasy tohave todamn themanwhomeant most
toyou.”
“Iwouldn’t damn you ifyou’d only stayaway fromme.”
Francisco’s eveswidened alittle, thenhegrinned and said, “Iwas
speaking ofMr.Danagger.”
Foraninstant, Rearden looked as ifhewanted toslap hisown
face,thenhelaughed softly and said, “All light Sitdown.”
Hewaited toseewhat advantage Francisco would takeof itnow,
butFrancisco obeyed him insilence, with asmile thathadanoddly
boyish quality alook oftriumph andgratitude, together.
“Idon’tdamn KenDanagger.” saidRearden.
“YoudonV?”Thetwowords seemed tofallwith asingular em-
phasis: theywerepronounced very quietly, almost cautiously, with
noremnant ofasmile onFrancisco’s face.
“No. 1don't trytoprescribe howmuch amanshould have to
bear. Ifhebroke, it’snotformetojudge him.”
“Ifhebroke . .?”
“Well, didn’t he?”
Francisco leaned back; hissmile returned, but itwasnotahappy
smile. “What will hisdisappearance dotoyou?”
“Iwilljusthave towork alittle harder.”
Francisco looked atasteel bridge traced inblack strokes against
redsteam beyond thewindow, and said, pointing. “Every oneof
those girders hasalimit totheload itcancarry. What’s yours?”
Rearden laughed. “Isthatwhat you’re afraid of? Isthatwhyyou
came here? Were youafraid I’dbreak? Didyouwant tosaveme,
asDagny Taggart wanted tosaveKenDanagger? Shetried toreach
himmtime, hutcouldn’t.”
“She did? 1didn’t know it.Miss Taggart and Idisagree about
many things.”
417
“Don't worry. I’mnotgoing tovanish. Letthem allgiveupand
stopworking, twon’t. Idon’tknowmylimitanddon’t care. All 1
have toknow isthat 1can’t bestopped.”
“Anymancanbestopped, Mr.Rearden.”
“How?”
“It’sonly amatter ofknowing man’s motive power.”
“What isit?”
“You ought toknow, Mr.Reardcn. You’re oneofthe lastmoral
men lefttotheworld.”
Rearden chuckled inbitter amusement “I’ve been called just
about everything but that.And you’re wrong. Youhave noidea
howwrong.”
“Are yousure/”
“Iought toknow. Moral? What onearthmade yousayit?”
Francisco pointed tothemillsbeyond thewindow. “This.”
Foralongmoment, Rearden looked athimwithout moving, then
asked only,“What doyoumean?”
“Ifyouwant toseeanabstract principle, such asmoral action, in
material form—there itis.Look at it,MrRearden. Lsery girder of
it.every pipe, wireandvalve wasputthere byachoice inanswer
tothequestion: right orwrong? Youhad tochoose rightandyou
had tochoose thebest within yourknowledge—thebest foryour
purpose, which was tomake steel—andthenmove onandextend
theknowledge, anddobetter, and stillbetter, withyourpurpose as
your standard ofvalue. Youhadtoactonyourownjudgment, you
hadtohave thecapacity tojudge, thecourage tostand ontheverdict
ofyour mind, andthepurest, themost ruthless consociation tothe
ruleofdoing right, ofdoing thebest, theutmost best possible to
you.Nothing could havemade you actagainst your judgment, and
youwould have rejected aswrong—asevil-— anymanwhoattempted
totellyouthatthebestway toheat afurnace wasto fill itwith ice
Millions ofmen, anentire nation, were notable todeter youfrom
producing Rearden Mela!—because youhadtheknowledge ofits
superlative value andthepower which suchknowledge gives. But
what Iwonder about, MrRearden, iswhyyou livebyonecode of
principles when youdeal withnature aridbyanother when youdeal
withmen?”
Rearden’s eyeswere fixed onhimsointently that thequestion
came slowly, asiftheeffort topronounce itwere adistraction1
“What doyoumean?”
“Why don’t youhold tothepurpose ofyour lifeasclearly and
rigidly asyouhold tothepurpose ofyour mills?”
“What doyoumean?”
“You havejudged every brick within thisplace byitsvailue tothe
goal ofmaking steel.Have youbeen asstrict about thegoalwhich
yourworkandyour steel areserving? What doyouwish toachieve
bygiving your lifetothemaking ofsteel? Bywhat standard ofvalue
doyoujudge yourdays? Forinstance, whydidyouspent# tenyears
ofexacting effort toproduce Rearden Metal?”
Rearden looked away, theslight, slumping movement ofhisshoul-
418
ders likeasighofrelease anddisappointment. “Ifyouhave toask
that,thenyouwouldn't understand.”
‘if 1toldyou that Iunderstand it,butyoudon't—would you
throwme‘outofhere?”
“Ishould havethrown yououtofhereanyway—sogoahead, tell
mewhatyoumean.”
“Are youproud ofthe railoftheJohn GaltLine?”
“Yes.”
“Why?”
“Because it'sthebestradevermade.”
“Why didyoumake it?”
“Inorder tomake money.”
“There weremany easier ways tomake money. Why didyou
choose thehardest?”
“You said itinyour speech atTaggart's wedding: inorder to
exchange mybest effort forthebest effort ofothers.”
“Ifthatwasyour purpose, haveyouachieved it?”
Abeat oftime vanished inaheavy drop ofsilence “No,” said
Reardon,
“Have voumade anymoney?”
“No.”'
“When you strain yourenergy toitsutmost inorder toproduce
thebest,doyouexpect toberewarded for itorpunished?” Rearden
didnotanswer. “Byevery standard ofdecency, oihonor, ofjustice
known toyou— -areyouconvinced thatyoushould havebeen re-
warded forit?”
“Yes,” saidRearden, hisvoice low
“Then ifyouwere punished, instead-— what sort olcode have
vouaccepted?”
Rearden didnotanswer,
“It isgenerally assumed,” saidFrancisco, “that living inahuman
society makes one’s lifemuch easier andsater than ilonewere left
alone tostruggle against nature onadesert island. Nowwherever
there isamanwhoneeds orusesmetal inanyway—Rearden Metal

“No,” saidReaiden, hisvoice low.
“Has itletlyour lifeas itwasbefore youproduced theMetal?”
“No—” saidRearden, theword breaking offasifhehadcutshort
thethought thatfollowed.
Francisco's voice lashed athimsuddenly, asacommand: “Say it!”
“Ithasmade itharder,” saidRearden tunelessly.
“When you feltptoud ofthe railoftheJohn Galt Lane,” said
Francisco, themeasured rhythm othisvoice giving aruthless clarity
tohiswools, “what sou otmen didyouthink of?Didyouwant to
seethatLineusedbyyour equals -bygiants ofproductive energy,

“Yes.” saidRearden eagerly.
“Didyouwant tosee itusedbymenwhocould notequal the

whowould dotheir best,work ashard asyoudid, livebytheirown

“Yes,” saidRearden gently.
"‘Didyouwant tosee itusedbywhining rotters whonever rouse

“I'd blast that rail first,” saidRearden, hislipswhite
“Then whydon't youdo it,Mr.Rearden? Ofthethree kinds of
men 1described—which men arebeing destroyed andwhich are
using your Line today1
They heard thedistant metal heartbeats ofthemills through the
longthread ofsilence.
“What ldescribed last,” said Francisco, “isanymanwho pro-
claims hisright toasingle penny ofanother man seffort.”
Rearden didnotanswer; hewaslooking atthereflection ofaneon
signondarkwindows inthedistance.
“You take pride insetting nolimit toyourendurance. Mr.Rear-
den,because youthink thatyouarcdoing right.What ifyouaren’t?
What ifyou’re placing your virtue intheservice ofeviland letting

men asyoudoamong ironsmelters? Youwhowon't allow oneper
centofimpurity intoanalloy ofmetal— -what haveyouallowed into
yourmoral code?”
Rearden satvery still: thewords inhismind were likethebeatof
stepsdown the trailhehadbeen seeking; thewords were thesanc-
tion ofthevictim.
“You. whowould notsubmit tothehardships ofnature, butset
outtoconquer itandplaced itintheservice ofyour jiWandyour

whoknow from yourwork thatonebears punishment only forbeing
wrong—what haveyoubeen willing tobearand forw^at reason?
Allyour life,youhaveheard yourself denounced, notforjiyour faults,
butforyour greatest virtues. Youhave been hated, nbtforyour
mistakes, butforyour achievements. Youhavebeen scorned for all

those qualities ofcharacter which areyour highest pride.Youhave
been called selfish forthecourage ofacting onyourownjudgment
andbearing sole responsibility foryourown life.Youhavebeen
called arrogant foryour independent mind.Youhavebeen called
cruel foryour unyielding integrity. Youhavebeen called antisocial

who've created abundance where there hadbeen nothing butwaste-
landsandhelpless, starving menbefore you,havebeen called arob-
ber.You,who’ve keptthem allalive, havebeen called anexploiter.
You, thepurest andmost moral manamong them, have been
sneered atasa“vulgar materialist.’ Have youstopped toaskthem:

Youknew thatmanneeds thestrictest code ofvalues todeal with

aweapon younever suspected orunderstood. Their moral code is
their weapon. Ask yourself howdeeply and inhowmany terrible
ways youhave accepted it.Ask yourself what iti>thatacode of

though youthink youought todamn me? It'sbecause I'mthe first
manwho hasgiven youwhat thewhole world owesyouandwhat
youshould havedemanded ofallmen before youdealt withthem:
amoral sanction.”
Rearden whirled tohim,thenremained still,with astillness like
agasp, Francisco leaned forward, a.sifhewere reaching thelanding
ofadangerous flight: and hiseyeswere steady, buttheir glance
seemed totremble with intensity.

Areyouwilling toaccept it?Doyoucare topurchase—attheprice

"No!”
"Mr. Reardon," saidFrancisco, hisvoice solemnly calm, "ifyou

went upandcrashed, scattering into thefaintmoan otgears. The
glass ofthewindows tinkled once inawhile.
Francisco’s eyeswere watching Reardon as ithewere examining

Francisco hadpreceded him.Flung bytheblast ofthesamjb response
asbisown. Francisco was flyingdown the hall, pressing ihebutton

oftheelevator and,notwaiting, racing ondown thestairs. Rcarden
followed himand,watching thedialoftheelevator onthestair
landings, theymet ithalfway down theheight ofthebuilding, Before
thesteel cagehadceased trembling atthe silloftheground floor,
Francisco was out. racing tomeet thesound ofthecallforhelp.
Rcarden hadthought himself agood runner, buthecould notkeep
upwith theswift figure streaking offthrough stretches ofredglare
anddarkness, thefigure olauseless playboy hehadhated himself
toradmiring.
Thestream, gushing from aholelowonthesideofablast furnace,
didnothave theredglow oflire,butthewhite radiance ofsunlight.
Itpoured along theground, branching offatrandom insudden
streaks; itcutthrough adank fogofsteam with abright suggestion
ofmorning. Itwas liquid iron,andwhat thescream ofthealarm
proclaimed was abreak-out.
Thecharge ofthefurnace hadbeenhung uparid, breaking, had
blown thetap-hole open. Thefurnace foreman layknocked uncon-
scious. thewhite flow spurted, slowly tearing thehole wider, and
menwere struggling withsand, hoseand fireclay tostoptheglowing
stleaks thatspread inaheavy, gliding motion, eating everything on
theirway into jetsofacrid smoke.
Inthefewmoments which Rcarden needed tograsp thesightand
nature ofthedisaster, hesaw aman’s figure rising suddenly atthe
tootofthefurnace, afigure outlined bytheredglare almost asifit
stood inthepath olthetorrent, hesawtheswing ofawhite shirt-
slee\cd arm thatroseandflung ablack object intothesource ofthe
spurting metal. ItwasFrancisco d'Aneonia. and hisaction belonged
toanaitwhich Rcarden hadnotbelieved anyman tobetrained to
pciform anylonger.
Years before. Realdenhadworked inanobscure steel plant in
Minnesota, where ithadbeen hisjob. alter ablast furnace was
tapped, toclose theholebyhand—bythrowing bullets offireday
todam theflow ofthemetal Itwasadangerous jobthatbadtaken
many lives, ithadbeen abolished years earlier bytheinvention of
thehydraulic gun;butthere hadbeen struggling, tailing mills which,
ontheirwaydown, hadattempted tousetheoutworn equipment
andmethods ofadistant pastRcarden haddone thejob;butinthe
years since, hehadmetnootherman able todo it.Inthemidst of
shooting jetsoflivesteam, inthefaceofacrumbling blast furnace,
hewasnow seeing the tall,slim figure oltheplayboy performing
thetaskwith the skillofanexpert.
Ittookaninstant foiRcarden totear otthiscoal, sci/c apairof

otthefurnace. There wasnotime tospeak, tofeelortowonder.
H.mciseo glanced athimonce— andwhat Rcarden sawwas a
smudged face, black goggles andawide grin.
They stood onaslippery bank ofbaked mud, attheedge ofthe
white stream, with theraging holeunder their feet, flinging clayinto
theglarewhere thetwisting tongues thatlooked likegaswere boiling
metal, Reardon’s consciousness became aprogression ofbending*
raising theweight, aiming andsending itdown and. before ithad
423
reached itsunseen destination, bending forthenextone again, a
consciousness drawn tightupon watching theaimofhisarm, tosave
thefurnace, andtheprecarious posture ofhisfeet, tosave himself.
Hewasaware ofnothing else—except that thesum of itwas the
exultant feeling ofaction, ofhisown capacity, ofhisbody’s precision,
ofitsresponse tohiswill:And, withnotime toknow it,butknowing
it,seizing itwith hissenses past thecensorship ofhismind, hewas
seeing ablack silhouette with redrays shooting from behind its
shoulders, itselbows, itsangular curves, theredrays circling through
steam likethelong needles ofspotlights, following themovements
ofaswift, expert, confident beingwhom hehadnever seen before
except inevening clothes under thelights ofballrooms.
There wasnotime toform words, tothink, toexplain, buthe
knew that thiswastherealFrancisco d'Anconia, thiswaswhat he
hadseenfrom the firstandloved—theword didnotshock him,
because there wasnoword inhismind, there wasonly ajoyous
feeling thatseemed likeaflow ofenergy added tohisown.
Totherhythm ofhisbody, with thescorching heatonhisface
andthewinter night onhisshoulder blades, hewasseeing suddenly
that thiswasthesimple essence ofhisuniverse: theinstantaneous
refusal tosubmit todisaster, the irresistible drive tofight it,the
triumphant feeling ofhisown ability towin.Hewascertain that
Francisco felt it,too. thathehadbeenmoved bythesame impulse,
that itwas right tofeel it.right forboth ofthem tobewhat they
were—hecaught glimpses ofasweat-streaked face intent upon ac-
tion.and itwasthemost joyous facehehadeverseen
Thefurnace stood above them, ablack bulkwrapped incoils of
tubes andsteam, sheseemed topant, shooting redgasps thathung
ontheairabove themills—andtheyfought nottoletherbleed to
death. Sparks hung about their feetandburst insudden sheafs out
ofthemetal, dying unnoticed against their clothes, against theskin
oftheir hands. Thestream wascoming slower, inbroken spurts
through thedam rising beyond their sight.
Ithappened sofast thatRearden knew itfully only after itwas
over.Heknew thatthere weretwomoments: the firstwaswhen he
sawtheviolent swing ofFrancisco's body inaforward thrust that
sentthebullet tocontinue theline inspace, thenhesawthesudden,
unrhythmic jerkbackward thatdidnotsucceed, theconvulsive beat
mgagainst aforward pull, theextended arms ofthesilhouette losing
itsbalance, hethought thataleapacross thedistance between them
ontheslippery, crumbling ndge would mean thedeath ofboth of
them—andthesecond moment waswhen helanded atFrancisco s
side,heldhim inhisarms,hung swaying together between space and
ridge, over thewhite pit,thengamed hisfooting andpulled him
back, and, foraninstant, stillheld thelength ofFrancisco’s body
against thelength ofhisown, ashewould have heldthejbody ofan
only son*Hislove, histerror, hisrelief were inasingle |enlence:
careful, yougoddamn fool!"
Francisco reached forachunk ofclayandwent on.
When thejobwasdone andthegapwasclosed, Rearden noticed
thattherewasatwisting pain inthemuscles ofhisarnfeami legs.

were entering hisoffice inthemorning, eager fortennewproblems
tosolve.Helooked atFrancisco andnoticed forthe firsttime that
their clothes hadblack-ringed holes, that theirhands were bleeding,
thatthere wasapatch ofskin tornonFrancisco’s temple andared
thread winding down hischeekbone. Francisco pushed thegoggles
back offhiseyesandgrinned athim: itwasasmile ofmorning.
Ayoung man with alook ofchronic hurtandimpertinence to-
gether, rushed uptohim, crying, “Icouldn’t help it,Mr.Reardon!”
andlaunched intoaspeech ofexplanation. Rearden turned hisback
onhimwithout aword. Itwastheassistant incharge ofthepressure
gauge ofthefurnace, ayoung manoutofcollege.
Somewhere ontheouter edge ofReardon's consciousness, there
wasthethought thataccidents ofthisnature werehappening more
frequently now,caused bythekind oforehewasusing, buthehad
tousewhatever orehecould find.There wasthethought that his
oldworkers hadalways been able toavert disaster; any ofthem
would have seen theindications ofahangupandknown how to
prevent it;butthere were notmany ofthem left,andhehadto
employ whatever menhecould find. Through theswirling coilsof
steam around him,heobserved that itwastheoldermenwhohad
rushed from allover themills tofight thebreakout andnowstood
inline,being given firstaidbythemedical staff.Hewondered what
washappening totheyoung men ofthecountry. Butthewonder
wasswallowed bythesight ofthecollege boy's face,which hecould
notbear tosee,byawave ofcontempt, bythewordless thought
that ifthiswastheenemy, therewasnothing tofear. Allthese things
came tohimandvanished intheouter darkness; thesight blotting
them outwasFrancisco d'Anconia.
HesawFrancisco giving orders tothemenaround him.They did
notknowwhohewasorwhere hecame from, butthey listened:
theyknew hewasamanwhoknew hisjob.Francisco broke offin
themiddle ofasentence, seeing Rearden approach and listen, and
said, laughing, "Oh, 1begyourpardon!” Rearden said,"Go right
ahead. Ifs allcorrect, sofar.”
Ihev said nothing toeach other when they walked together
through thedarkness, ontheirwayback totheoffice. Rearden fell
anexultant laughlei swelling within him,hefeltthathewanted, in
histurn, towink atFrancisco like afellow' conspirator whohad
learned asecret Francisco would notacknowledge. Heglanced at
hisfaceonce inawhile, butFrancisco would notlook athim.
After awhile, Francisco said. ‘You savedmy life,’’The“thank
you” witsmthewayhesaid it.
Rearden chuckled. “You savedmyfurnace.”
They wentoninsilence Rearden tollhimself growing lighter with
every step. Raising hisface tothecold air,hesawthepeaceful darkness

demanding theapology hewasjoyously eager tooffer. Instead, he
sawafacemade lifeless byanodddejection.
“Ate youhurt?”
“No...no,notatall.”
“Come here,” ordered Reardon, opening thedoor ofhisbath-
room.
“Look atyourself.”
“Never mind.Youcome here.”
Forthe firsttime,Reardon feltthathewastheolder man; hefelt
thepleasure oftaking Francisco incharge; he feltaconfident,
amused, paternal protectiveness. Hewashed thegrime oftFrancisco’s
face,heputdisinfectants andadhesive bandages onhistemple, his
hands, hisscorched elbows. Francisco obeyed him insilence.
Rearden asked, inthetoneofthemost eloquent salute hecould
offer, “Where didyoulearn towork likethat?”
Francisco shrugged. “Iwasbrought uparound smelters ofever)
kind,” heanswered indifferently,
Reardon could notdecipher theexpression ofhisface: itwasonly
alook ofpeculiar stillness, asifhiseyeswere fixedonsome secret
vision ofhisown thatdrew hismouth intoalineofdesolate, bitter,
hurting self-mockery
They didnotspeak until theywere back intheoffice.
“You know,” saidRearden. “everything you saidherewas true.
But thatwasonly partofthestory. The other part iswhat we've
done tonight. Don't yousee?Wereable toact.They’re not.Soit’s
wewho’ll winmthelong run,nomatter what theydotous.’
Francisco didnotanswer.
“Listen,” saidRearden, “Iknow what’s been thetrouble withyou.
You've never cared todoatealday’s work inyour life Ithought
youwere conceited enough, but Iseethatyouhavenoidea otwhat

Heexpected aburst oflaughter andhewasprepared toargue;
instead, hesawFrancisco shaking hishead slowly, asifhecould not
trust hisvoice, as ithefeared thatwerehetospeak, hewould accept.
Inamoment, hesaid,“Mr, Rearden ... Ithink Jwould give (he
restofmy lifeforoneyear asyour furnace foreman. But 1can’t,”
“Why not?”
“Don’t askme It's . .apersonal matter.”
The vision ofFrancisco inReardon’s mind, which hehadresented
andfound irresistibly attractive, hadbeen thefigure olaman radi-
antly incapable ofsuffering. What hesawnow' inFrancisco's eyes
wasthelook ofaquiet, lightly controlled, patiently borne/ torture.
Francisco reached silently forhisovercoat.
“You’re notleaving, areyou?” asked Rearden.
“Yes.”
“Aren’t yougoing tofinish what youhadtotellme?”
“Not tonight.”
426
‘‘You wanted metoanswer aquestion. What was it?”
Francisco shook hishead.
“You started asking mehowcan I ...Howcan lwhat?”
Francisco's smile was likeamoan ofpain, theonlymoan hewould
permit himself. “Iwon't ask it,Mr.Rearden. 1know it.”
Chapter !VTHESANCTION OFTHEVICTIM
The roast turkey hadcost $30.Thechampagne hadcost $25.The
lace tablecloth, acobweb ofgrapes andvine leaves iridescent inthe
candlelight, hadcost $2,000. Thedinner service, withanartist's de~
signburned inblueandgold intoatranslucent white china, hadcost
$2,500. Thesilverware, which bore theinitialsLRinEmpire wreaths
oflaurels, hadcost $3,000, But itwasheld tobeunspiritual tothink
ofmoney andotwhat thatmoney represented.
Apeasant’s wooden shoe, gilded, stood inthecenter ofthetable,
filled withmarigolds, grapes andcarrots, 1hecandles were stuck into
pumpkins thatwere cutasopenmouthed faces drooling raisins, nuts
andcandy upon thetablecloth.
ftwasThanksgiving dinner, and thethreewho faced Rearden
about thetable were hiswife, hismother and hisbrother.
"Ihis isthenight tothank the Iordlorourblessings.” saidRear-
den's mother. "God liasbeen kind tousThere arepeople allover
thecountry whohaven't gotamfood inthehouse tonight, andsome

could've been me.butforthegiaee ofGod."
‘‘Well, ifthanks aremorder," said Lillian gaily. “Ithink thatwe
shouldn’t forget Gertrude, thenewcook. She's anartist."
“Me, I’m justgoing tobeold-fashioned,” said Philip. Tin just
going tothank thesweetest mother intheworld."
“Well, forthematter ofthat." S3idReardon's mother, “weought
tothank Lillian forthisdinner and for allthetrouble shetook to
make itsopretty. Shespent hours fixing thetable It’srealquaint
anddifferent."
“It's thewooden shoe thatdoes it,”said Philip, bending hishead
sidewise tostudy itinamanner ofeiilical appreciation. “That’s the
real touch. Anybody canhave candles, silverware andjunk, that
di>esn’t takeanything butmoney— butthisshoe, thattook thought,”
*Rearden saidnothing. Thecandlelight moved over hismotionless
face asover aportrait; theportrait boreanexpression ofimper-
sonal courtesy.
“You haven't touched your wine,” said hismother, looking athim,
427
“What 1think isyouought todrink atoast ingratitude tothepeople
ofthiscountry whohave given yousomuch.”
“Henry isnotinthemood for it.Mother,” said Lillian. “I'm afraid
Thanksgiving isaholiday only forthosewhohave aclear con-
science.'’ Sheraised herwine glass, butstopped ithalfway toher
lipsandasked, “You're notgoing tomake some sortofstand at
your trialtomorrow, areyou,Henry?”
“Iam.”
Sheputtheglassdown. “What areyougoing todo?”
“You'll see ittomorrow.”
“You don't really imagine thatyoucangetaway with it!”
“Idon'tknow what youhave inmind astheobject I’mtoget

“Doyourealize thatthecharge against vou isextremely serious?”
“1do.”
“You've admitted thatyousoldtheMetal toKenDanagger.”
“1have.”
“They might sendyou tojailfortenyears.”
“Idon’t think they will,but it’spossible.”
“Have youbeen reading thenewspapers, Henry?” asked Philip,
withanoddkind ofsmile.
“No,”
“Oh. youshould!”
“Should I?Why?”
“You ought toseethenames they callyou!”
“That’s interesting,” saidRearden; hesaid itabout thefactthat
Philip’s smile wasoneofpleasure.
“Idon't understand it,”said hismother. “Jail? Didyousay jail.
Lillian ?Henry, areyougoing tobesent tojail'*”
“1might be.”*
“But that’s ridiculous! Dosomething about it.”
“What?”
“Idon’t know. Idon’t understand anyof it.Respectable people
don’t gotojail.Dosomething. You've always known what todo
-about business.”
“Not thiskind ofbusiness.”
“Idon't believe it.”Hervoice hadthetoneofafrightened, spoiled
child. “You’re saying itjusttobemean.”
“He’s playing thehero, Mother.” said Lillian. Shesmiled coldly,
turning toRearden. “Don't youthink thatyour attitude isper-
fectly futile?”
“No.”
“Youknow thatcases ofthiskind arenot .. .intended ever to
come totrial.There areways toavoid it,togetthings settled amica-
bly—ifoneknows theright people.”
“Idon’tknow theright people.”
“Look atOrren Boyle. He'sdonemuch more andmud| worse
thanyour little fling attheblack market, buthe'ssmart cnouch to
keep himself outofcourtrooms.”
“Then I’mnotsmart enough,”
428
“Don’t youthink it’stimeyoumade aneffort toadjust yourself
totheconditions ofourage?”
“No,”
“Well, then 1don’t seehowyoucanpretend, thatyou’re some
sortofvictim. Ifyougotojail, itwillheyourown fault.”
"What pretense areyoutalking about, Lillian?”
“Oh, Iknow thatyouthink you’re fighting forsome sortofprinci-
ple—butactually it’sonly amatter ofyour incredible conceit. You’re
doing itfornobetter reason thanbecause youthink you’re right.”
“Doyouthink they’re right?”
Sheshrugged. “That's theconceit I’mtalking about—theidea that
itmatters who’s right orwrong. It’sthemost insufferable form of
vanity, this insistence onalways doing right.Mowdoyouknow
what’s right?How cananyone everknow it?ft'snothing butadelu-

Hewaslooking atherwith attentive interest. “Why should ithurt

“Is itnecessary formetopoint outthat inyour case it'snothing
buthypocrisy? That iswhy 1findyour attitude preposterous. Ques-

tainly nothing buthuman—aren’t you,Henry? You’re nobetter than

thatonemight findsome satisfaction inbeing amartyr, ifone is

.Shepaused toobserve theeffect. There wasnone, except that his
look ofattentive interest seemed intensified; helistened asifhewere
heldbysome impersonal, scientific curiosity. Itwasnottheresponse
shehadexpected.
“Ibelieve youunderstand me,” shesaid.
“No,” heanswered quietly, “Idon’t.”
“Ithink youshould abandon theillusion ofyourown perfection,
which youknow fullwell tobeanillusion. 1thinkyoushould learn
togetalong withother people. Thedayofthehero ispast. This is
thedayofhumanity, inamuch deeper sense thanyouimagine.

Thelook ofhiseyes, held raptly stilluponsome point inspace,
wasnotinanswer toherwords; itwas inanswer toaman’s voice
saying tohim,”Doyouthink thatwhat you’re facing ismerely a
conspiracy toseize your wealth? You,whoknow thesource of
wealth, should know it’smuch more andmuch worse than that.”
Heturned tolook atLillian. Hewasseeing the fullextent ofher
failure—intheimmensity ofhisown indifference. Thedroning
stream ofherinsults waslikethesound ofadistant riveting machine,
along, impotent pressure thatreached nothing within him.Hehad
heard herstudied reminders ofhisguiltonevery evening hehad
spent athome inthepastthree months. But guilthadbeen theone
emotion hehadfound himself unable tofeel.Thepunishment she
hadwanted toinflict onhimwasthetorture ofshame: what shehad
inflicted wasthetorture ofboredom.
Heremembered hisbrief glimpse—onthatmorning intheWayne-
Falkland Hotel—ofaflaw inherscheme otpunishment, which he
hadnotexamined. Now hestaled ittohimself forthe firsttimeShe
wanted toforce upon him thesuffering ofdishonor— buthisown
sense ofhonor washeronlyweapon (ifenforcement. Shewanted to
wrest fromhimanacknowledgment ofhismoral depravity- -butonly
hisownmoral rectitude could attach significance tosuch averdict.
Shewanted toinjure himbyhercontempt—buthecould notbe
injured, unless herespected herjudgment. Shewanted topunish him
forthepainhehadcaused herandsheheldherpainasagunaimed

Butheronly toolwas hisownbenevolence, hisconcern forher, his
compassion, liferonlypower wasthepower ofhisown virtues. What
ifhechose towithdraw it?
Anissue ofguilt, hethought, had torestonhisownacceptance
ofthecode ofjustice thatpronounced him guilty. Hedidnotaccept
it;henever had His virtues, allthevirtues sheneeded toachieve
hispunishment, came from another code and lived byanother stan-

Butwhat wasthecodeonwhich sheacted9What sortofcode

destroy onlythosewho tried toobserve it;apunishment, (rttm which
onlythehonest would suffer, while thedishonest would escape unhurt.
Could oneconceive ofaninfamy lower than toequate virtue with
pain, tomake virtue, notvice, thesource andmotive power ofsuffer-
ing? Ifhewere thekind ofrotter shewasstruggling tomake him

Hesatvery still,heldbythehammering ofasingle question: Did
Lillian know theexact nature ofherscheme?— -was itaconscious

hedidnothateherenough tobelieve it.
Helooked ather.Shewasabsorbed, atthemoment, inthetask
ofcutting aplum pudding thatstood asamount ofblueflame ona

laughing mouth— shewasplunging asilver knife intotheflame, with
apiacticed, graceful curve ofherarm.Shehadmetallic leaves inthe
red,goldandbrown colors ofautumn scattered overoneshoulder of

Hecould notgetridoftheimpression, which hehadkept reeeiv-

though everything within thehouse wasofherownchoice and taste,

ager ofahigh-class hotel,whokeeps smiling inbitter amusement at
herposition ofinferiority totheowners. Iheamusement remained,
butthebitterness wasgone. Shehadnotgained weight, buther
features had losttheir delicate sharpness inablurring, softening look
ofsatisfaction: even hervoice sounded as ifithadgrown plump.
Hedidnothearwhat shewassaying: shewaslaughing inthelast
flicker oftheblue flames, while hesatweighing thequestion: Did
sheknow? He feltcertain thathehaddiscovered asecret much
greater than theproblem ofhismarriage, thathehadgrasped the
formula ofapolicy practiced more widely throughout theworld than
hedared tocontemplate atthemoment. Buttoconvict ahuman
being ofthat practice wasaverdict ofirrevocable damnation, and
heknew thathewould notbelieve itofanyone, solong asthe
possibility ofadoubt remained.
No--hethought, looking atLillian, withthelasteffort ofhisgener-
osity— hewould notbelieve itofherInthename ofwhatever grace

hadseen asmile ofjoyonherface, thesmile ofaliving being—in

'Die butler slipped aplate ofplum pudding infront ofhim,and
heheard Lillian’s voice: “Where have youbeen forthe last five
minuses, Henry—orisitforthelastcentury? Youhaven’t answered
me.Youhaven’t heard aword Isaid.”
431
“Iheard it,”heanswered quietly. "‘Idon’tknow what you’re trying
toaccomplish.”
“What aquestion!” said hismother. “Isn’t that just likeaman?
She’s trying tosaveyoufrom going tojail— that's what she’s tiying
toaccomplish.”
That could betrue,hethought; perhaps, bythereasoning ofsome
crude, childish cowardice, themotive oftheir malice wasadesire to
protect him, tobreak himdown intothesafety ofacompromise.
It’spossible, hethought—butknew thathedidnotbelieve it
"You’ve always been unpopular,” said Lillian, “and it'smore than
amatter ofanyoneparticular issue. It'sthatunyielding, intractable
attitude ofyours. Themenwho’re going totryyou,know what
you're thinking. Dial's why they’ll crackdown onyou. while they’d

"Why, no, 1don’t think theyknow what I'mthinking. Thai’s what
Ihave toletthemknow tomorrow”
“Unless youshowthem thatyou’re willing togive inandcooper-
ate,youwon’t have achance. You’ve been toohard todealwith”
“No. I’vebeen tooeasy”
"But ifthey putyou injail”said hismother, "what's going to

"No. Ihaven't,”
"Have youthought ofthedisgrace you’ll bringupon us?”
"Mother, doyouunderstand theissue inthiscase'”
“No, Idon’t and Idon’t want tounderstand. It's alldirty bustness

“No,Mother !don’tknow orcare.”
Hismother looked athim. aghast.
“Well, 1think youhave avery provincial attitude, allofyou,”
said Philip suddenly. "Nobody hereseems tobeconcerned with the

Mother, \canexplain theissue toyouvery simply. Theie’s nothing
unusual about it,thecourts arefullofcases ofthiskind.Businessmen
aretaking advantage ofthenational emergency inordei tomake

fareofall—forthesake oftheirownpersonal gain. They’re profi-
teers oftheblack market whogrow richbydefrauding thepoor of
their rightful share, atatimeofdesperate shortage. They pursue a
ruthless, grasping, grabbing, antisocial policy, based onnothing but
plain, selfish greed. It’snousepretending about it,we allknow it—

Rearden satlooking athim, asifstudying anobject seen torthe

first time.Somewhere deep inRearden’s mind, asasteady, gentle
inexorable beat,wasaman’s voice, saying: Bywhat right?—bywhat
code?- -bywhat standard?
“Philip,” hesaid, notraising hisvoice, “sayanyofthatagain and
you willfindyourself outinthestreet, rightnow, with thesuityou’ve
gotonyour back, withwhatever change you've gotinyour pocket
andwithnothing else.”
Heheard noanswer, nosound, nomovement. Henoted thatthe
stillness ofthethree before himhadnoelement ofastonishment.
Thelook ofshock ontheir faces wasnottheshock ofpeople atthe
sudden explosion ofabomb, buttheshock ofpeople whohadknown
thattheywere playing with alighted fuse.There werenooutcries,
noprotests, noquestions: theyknew thathemeant itandtheyknew
everything itmeant.Adimsickening feeling toldhim thattheyhad
known itlongbefore hedid.
“You ...youwouldn’t throw yourownbrother outonthestreet,
would you?” hismother said atlast; itwasnotademand, butaplea.
“Iwould.”
“But he’syour brother .. .Doesn’t thatmean anything toyou?”
“No.”
“Maybe hegoes abittoofarattimes, but it’sjustloose talk, it’s

“Then lethimlearn.”
“Don’t behardonhim . .he'syounger thanyouand . . .and

“You can’tbehardonamanwhoneeds you. itwillpreyonyour

“Itwon't.”
“You’ve gottobekind,Hemy.”
“I’m not.”
“You've gottohavesome pity.”
“1haven’t.”
"Agoodmanknows how toforgive.”
“Idon’t,”
“You wouldn’t wantmetothink thatyou're sellish.”
“1am.”
Philip's eyeswere darting fromonetotheother. Helooked like
amanwhohad feltcertain thathestood onsolid granite andhad
suddenly discovered that itwas thin ice.now cracking open all
around him,
“But 1 .hetried, andstopped: hisvoice sounded likesteps

“I ...I'mnotspeaking ofthat.”
“Iam.”
“1don’t understand it ..
“Don’t you?”
“You’ve always known my...mypolitical views. You’ve never

“That’s true,” saidRearden gravely. “Perhaps 1oweyouanexpla-

Butforthemovement ofdrawing hishead alittle into hisshoul-

here,” hesaid; hisvoice was lifeless and shrill. “Ifyouthink I’m
happy, you're mistaken. I’dgiveanything togetaway,” Thewords
pertained todefiance, butthevoice hadacuriously cautious quality
“Ifthat ishowyou feelabout it,itwould bebest lormetoleave.”

"Don’t explain,” saidReardcn. Hewaslooking atPhilip's face. It
was half-lowered, itseyeslooking upathim.Theeyeswere lifeless,

f'hcrevulsion thatmade Rearden turn hislaceaway contained a
spasm ofpity.There wasaninstant when hewanted toseize his

"Don’t let’s quarrel,” said hismother, hervoice cheerless and
vague. "It’sThanksgiving Day.”
When helooked atLillian, hecaught aglance thatmade him
certain shehadwatched him foralong time, itsquality waspanic.
Hegotup."You willplease excuse menow.” hesaidtothetable

"Where areyougoing?” asked Lillian shatply.

“Why doyouwish togotoNewYork tonight?”
“Ithink, Lillian, forthesame reason thatmakes youwish to

“That iswhat 1mean.”

Heturned and lefttheroom.
Sitting atthewheel ofhiscar,with theglassy, frozen road flying
athisfaceanddown under thewheels atsixty miles anhour, helet
thethought ofhisfamily dropaway fromhim-and thevision oftheir
faceswent rotting back intotheabyss ofspeed thatswallowed thehare
treesandlonely structures oftheroadside. There was little traffic,
andfew lights inthedistant dusters ofthetowns hepassed; the
emptiness ofinactivity wastheonly signofaholiday. Ahazy glow,
rusted byfrost, flashed above theroofofafactory once inarare
while, andacoldwind shrieked through thejoints ofhiscar,healing
thecanvas topagainst themetal frame.
Bysome dimsense ofconti ast,which hedidnotdefine, the
thought ofhisfamily wasreplaced bythethought ofhisencounter
with theWetNurse, theWashington boyofhismills.
Atthetime ofhisindictment, hehaddiscovered thattheboyhad
known about hisdealwithDanagger, yethadnotreported ittoany-
one.“Why didn't youinform your friends about me?” hehadasked.
Theboyhadanswered brusquely, notlooking athim. ‘Didn’t
want to.”
“Itwaspartofyourjobtowatch precisely forthings ofthatkind,
wasn’t it?”
“Yeah.”
“Besides, your friends would havebeen delighted tohear it.”
“Iknow.”
“Didn’t youknow what avaluable piece ofinformation itwasand
what astupendous trade youcould have pulled with those friends
ofyours inWashington whom youoffered tomeonce—remem-
ber?—thefriends whoalways ‘occasion expenses'?” Theboyhadnot
answered. “Itcould havemade your career atthevery top level.
Don’t tellmethatyoudidn't know it.”
“Iknew it,”
“Then why didn’t youmake useofit?”
“Ididn’t want to.”
“Why not?”
“Don’t know.”*
Theboyhadstood, glumly avoiding Reardcn’s eyes,a*iftrying
toavoid something incomprehensible within himself. Reairden had
laughed. “Listen, Non-Absolute, you’re playing with fire.Better go
andmurder somebody fast,before you let itgetyou—thatreason
436
thatstopped youfrom turning informer—orelse itwill blastyour
career tohell.”
Theboyhadnotanswered.
Thismorning, Rearden hadgone tohisoffice asusual, eventhough
therestoftheoffice building was closed. Atlunch time, hehad
stopped attherolling mills andhadbeen astonished tofindthe
WetNurse standing there, alone inacorner, ignored byeverybody,
watching thework withanairofchildish enjoyment.
“What areyoudoing here today?” Rearden hadasked. “Don't
youknow it’saholiday?”
“Oh. 1letthegirls off,but 1justcame intofinishsome business.”
“What business?”
“Oh. letters and . .Oh. hell, 1signed three letters andsharpened
mypencils, Iknow 1didn’t have todo ittoday, but 1hadnothing
todoathome and . . Igetlonesome away from thisplace.”
“Don't youhaveanyfamily?”
“No . ..not tospeak of.What about you. Mr.Rearden? Don’t
youhaveany?”
“Iguess— nottospeak of”
“1like thisplace !liketohangaround . ..Youknow Mr.Rear-

Walking away, Rearden hadturned toglance backandhadcaught

Rearden looked away from theheadlines totheglow attheedge

tightened onthewheel alittle.
Itwashalfpastninewhen hereached thecity.Dagny’s apartmenl

“Don’t youknow it'saholiday?” heasked.
“Hello, Hank. Railroads havenoholidays. Where areyou call-

“Your place.”
“I’llbethrough inanother half-hour”
“it’s allright. Stay there. I’llcome foryou.”
Theanteroom ofheroffice wasdark,when heentered, except for
thelighted glass cubbyhole ofEddie Wiliers, Eddie wasclosing his
desk, getting ready toleave. Helooked atRearden. inpuz/lcd
astonishment.
“Good evening. Eddie. What isitthatkeeps youpeople sobusy—
theRockland wreck?”
Eddie sighed. “Yes, Mr.Rearden.”
“Thai’s what Iwant toseeDagny about— about your rail.”
“She’s stillhere.”
Hestarted toward herdoor,when Eddie called afterhim hesi-
tantly, “Mr.Rearden . ..”

'itmeans^much more thanyoususpect Perhaps more thanany

Dagny glanced upfrom herdesk,when Rearden entered herof-

hershoulders relaxing under herthinwhite blouse.
“Dagny, there’s something Iwant totellyouabout the railthat
youordered Iwantyou toknow thistonight.”
Shewaswatching himattentively; theexpression ofhisfacepulled
hers intothesame lookofquietly solemn tension:
“Iamsupposed todeliver toTaggart Transcontinental, onFebru-
aryfifteenth, sixtythousand tonsofrail,which istogive^outhree

Shehad listened without moving. Athislastsentence, hesawa
faint contraction ofhercheeks and lips; itwasnotquite asmile, but
itgavehimherwhole answer: pain, admiration, understanding.
Then hesawhereyesbecoming softer, more painfully, dangerously
alive—hetook herwrist, as ifthetightgrasp ofhisfingers andthe
severity ofhisglance were togiveherthesupport sheneeded—and
hesaid sternly, “Don't thankme—this isnotafavor— 1amdoing it
inorder tobeable tobearmywork, orelse I'llbreak likeKen
Danagger."
Shewhispered, “All right. Hank. Iwon't thank you," thetone of
hervoice and thelook ofhereyesmaking italiebythetime it

Hesmiled. “Give rnetheword Iasked."
She inclined herhead. “Igiveyoumyword." Hereleased her

that iftheysentence youtojailtomorrow. I’llquit— without waiting

“You won’t. And 1don't think they'll sentence metojail. Ithink

“What hypothesis?"
“Who isJohn Galt?" Hesmiled, andstood up.“That’s all.We

“No. But 1thinkmytraffic manager hassome sortofabaron

“I’ll try."
Hestood looking attheportrait ofNatTaggart onthewallofher

returned, bringing abottle ofbrandy andtwo glasses. Hetilled the
glasses insilence.
“You know, Dagny, Thanksgiving was aholiday established by
productive people tocelebrate thesuccess oftheirwork."

Themovement ofhisarm, asheraised hisglass, went from the

Foramonth inadvance, thepeople who tilled thecourtroom had
been toldbythepress thattheywould seethemanwhowasagreedy
enemy ofsociety; buttheyhadcome toseethemanwhohad in-
vented Rearden Metal,
Hestood up,when thejudges called uponhimtodoso.Hewore
agray suit,hehadpale blue eyesandblond hair; itwasnotthe
colors thatmade hisfigure seem icilyimplacable, itwasthefact that
thesuithadanexpensive simplicity seldom flaunted these days, that it
belonged mthesternly luxurious office ofarichcorporation, that
hisbearing came from acivilized eraandclashed with theplace
around him.
Thecrowd knew from thenewspapers thatherepresented theevil
ofruthless wealth; and—asthey praised thevirtue ofchastity, then
rantoseeanymovie thatdisplayed ahalf-naked female on itspost-
ers—sotheycame toseehim; evil, atleast, didnothave thestale
hopelessness ofabromide which none believed andnone dared to
challenge. They looked athimwithout admiration—admit ation was
afeeling theyhad lostthecapacity toexperience, long ago; they
looked with curiosity andwith adimsense ofdefiance against those
whohad toldthem that itwas their duty tohate him.
Afewyears ago.theywould have jeered athisairofself-confident
wealth. Ruttoday, there wasaslate-gray sky inthewindows ofthe
courtroom, which promised the firstsnowstorm ofatong, haid win-
ter:the lastofthecountry's oilwasvanishing, andthecoalmines
were notable tokeep upwith thehysterical setamble forwinter
supplies. Thecrowd inthecourtroom remembered that thiswasthe
casewhich hadcostthem theservices ofKenDanagger. There were
rumors thattheoutput oftheDanagger CoalCompany had fallen
perceptibly within onemonth; thenewspapers saidthat itwasmerely
amatter ofreadjustment whileDanagger’s cousin wasreorganizing
thecompany hehadtaken over. Lastweek, thefront pages had
carried thestory ofacatastrophe onthe siteofahousing project
under construction: defective steel girders hadcollapsed, killing four
workmen; thenewspapers hadnotmentioned, butthecrowd knew,
thatthegirders hadcome fromOircn Hoyle’s Associated Steel
They satinthecourtroom inheavy silence andtheylooked atthe
tall,gray figure, notwithhope— theywere losing thecapacity to
hope—butwithanimpassive neutrality spiked byafaint question
mark: thequestion mark wasplaced over allthepious slogans they
hadheard foryears.
Thenewspapers hadsnarled thatthecause ofthecountry's trou-
bles, asthiscasedemonstrated, wastheselfish greed ofrieftindustri-
alists; that itwasmen likeHank Rearden whowere toIblame lor
theshrinking diet, thefalling temperature andthecracking roofs iri
thehomes ofthenation; that ifithadnotbeen formen vifrhobroke
regulations andhampered thegovernment’s plans, prosperity would
havebeen achieved long ago;andthat aman likeHanl* Rearden
440
wasprompted bynothing buttheprofit motive. This lastwasstated
without explanation orelaboration, asifthewords ‘•profit motive”
were theself-evident brand ofultimate evil.
Thecrowd remembered thatthesesame newspapers, lessthantwo
years ago,hadscreamed that theproduction ofReardcn Metal
should beforbidden, because itsproducer wasendangering people's
lives forthesake ofhisgreed; theyremembered that theman in
grayhadridden inthecabofthe firstengine torunover atrack of
hisown Metal; and thathewasnowontrial forthegreedy crime
ofwithholding from thepublic aloadoftheMetal which ithadbeen
hisgreedy crime tooffer inthepublic market.
According totheprocedure established bydirectives, cases ofthis
kindwere nottried byajury, butbyapanel ofthree judges ap-
pointed bytheBureau ofEconomic Planning andNational Re-
sources; theprocedure, thedirectives hadstated, was tobeinformal
anddemocratic. Thejudge’s bench hadbeenremoved from theold
Philadelphia courtroom torthisoccasion, andreplaced byatableon
awooden platform: itgave theroom anatmosphere suggesting the
kind ofmeeting where apresiding body putssomething overona

"No. 1amfullyaware of itand 1amacting accordingly.”
Henoted thestillness oftheroom. Bythe iulesofthecomplicated
pretense which allthose people played foroneanother’s benefit,
theyshould have considered hisstand asincomprehensible folly;
there should havebeen lustles ofastonishment andderision: there
weie none, they sat still;theyunderstood.
“Doyoumean thatyou arerefusing toobey thelaw?” asked
thejudge.
‘'No. Iamcomplying with thelaw'—tothe letter. Your lawholds

“Aprisoner brought totrialcandefend himself only ifthere isan

inbewildered indignation andhewhispered toLarkin, “Good God,

“Arewetounderstand," asked thejudge, “that youholdyour

“Idonotcare toconsider it.”

“Goahead.”
“Ibegyourpardon?”
“Impose it.”
The three judges looked atoneanother. Then theirspokesman
turned back toRearden. “This isunprecedented,” hesaid.
“It iscompletely irregular/' said thesecond judge. “The lawre-

TFhceldest judge leaned forward across thetable and hisvoice
became suavely derisive: "You speak asifyouwere fighting forsome
softofprinciple, Mr.Reardcn, butwhat you're actually fighting lor
isonlyyour property, isn’t it?”
“Yes, ofcourse. Iamfighting formyproperty. Doyouknow the

"Yes. ofcourse. All Iwant isthefreedom tomake money. Do

"Iwork fornothing butmyown profit. Iearn it.”

Thecrowd burst intoapplause.
Rearden whirled around, more startled than hisjudges. Hesaw
faces thatlaughed inviolent excitement, andfaces thatpleaded for
help;hesawtheir silent despair breaking outintotheopen; hesaw
thesame anger andindignation ashisown. finding release inthe
wilddefiance oftheir cheering; hesawthelooks ofadmiration and
thelooks ofhope. There were alsothefaces ofloose-mouthed young
menandmaliciously unkempt females, thekindwho ledthebooing
mnewsreel theaters atanyappearance ofabusinessman onthe
Ncreen; they didnotattempt acounter-demonstration; theywere
silent.
Ashehx>ked atthecrowd, people saw inhisfacewhat thethreats
<>tthejudges hadnotbeen able toevoke: the firstsignofemotion.
Itwasafewmoments before theyheard thefurious beating ofa
gavelupon thetableandoneofthejudges yelling;
u~or Ishallhave thecourtroom cleared!”
445
Asheturned back tothetable, Rearden 'seyesmoved over the
visitors* section. Hisglance paused onDagny: apause perceptible
only toher,asifhewere saying: Itworks. Shewould haveappeared
calm except thathereyesseemed tohavebecome toolarge forher
face. Eddie Wtllers wassmiling thekind ofsmile that isaman’s
substitute forbreaking into tears. Mr.Mowen looked stupefied. Paul
Larkin wasstaring atthefloor. There wasnoexpression onBertram
ScuddeFs face—oronLillian’s. She satattheendofarow,herlegs
crossed, amink stole slanting from herright shoulder toher lefthip;
shelooked atRearden, notmoving.
Inthecomplex violence ofallthethings hefelt,hehadtime to
recognize atouch ofregret andoflonging: there wasafacehehad
hoped tosee,hadlooked torfrom the start ofthesession, had
wanted tobepresent more thananyother facearound him.But
Francisco d'Ancoma hadnotcome.
“Mr. Rearden,” said theeldest judge, smiling affably, reproach-
fullyandspreading hisarms, “it isregrettable thatyoushould have
misunderstood ussocompletely. That’s thetrouble—that business-
men refuse toapproach usinaspirit oftrustandfriendship. They
seem toimagine thatwearetheir enemies. Whydoyouspeak ot
human sacrifices? Whatmade yougotosuchanextreme? Wehave
nointention ofseizing your property ordestroying your life.Wedo
notseek toharm your interests. Wearefullyaware ofyour distin-
guished achievements. Ourpurpose isonly tobalance social pres-
sures anddojustice toall.Thishearing isreally intended, notasa
trial, butasafriendly discussion aimed atmulual understanding
andcooperation.”
“Idonotco-operate atthepoint ofagun.”
“Why speak ofguns? This matter isnotserious enough towarrant
such references. Wearefullyaware thattheguilt inthisease lies
chiefly withMr.Kenneth Danagger, who instigated thisinfungcmcnt
ofthelaw,whoexerted pressure upon youandwhoconfessed his
guiltbydisappearing inorder toescape trial.”
“No.Wedid itbyequal, mutual, voluntary agreement”
“Mr. Rearden,” saidthesecond judge, “youmaynotshare some
ofour ideas, butwhen all issaidanddone, we’re allworking for
thesame cause. Forthegood ofthepeople.Werealize thatyouweic
prompted todisregard legal technicalities bythecritical situation ol
thecoalmines and thecrucial importance offuel tothepublic
welfare.”
“No. Iwasprompted bymyown profit andmvown interests
What effect ithadonthecoalmines andthepublic welfare isfor
youtoestimate. Thatwasnotmvmotive.”
Mr.Mowen stared dazedly about himandwhispered UtPaul Lar
kin,“Something’s gone screwy here.”
“Oh, shutup!”snapped Larkin.
“Iamsure, Mr.Rearden,” saidtheeldest judge, “thatyoudonot
really believe— nordoes thepublic— thatwewish toire^lyou asa
sacrificial victim. Ifanyone hasbeen laboring under such4misappre-
hension, wearcanxious toprove that ifisnottrue.”
Thejudges retired toconsider their verdict. They didnotstayout
446
long:They returned toanominously silent courtroom—andan-
nounced thatafineof$5,000 wasimposed onHenry Rearden, but
thatthesentence wassuspended.
Streaks ofjeering laughter ranthrough theapplause thatswept
thecourtroom. Theapplause wasaimed atRearden, thelaughter*—
atthejudges.
Rearden stood motionless, notturning tothecrowd, barely hearing
theapplause. Hestood looking atthejudges. There wasnotriumph
inhisface,noelation, only the still intensity ofcontemplating a
vision with abitter wonder thatwasalmost fear.Hewasseeing the
enormity ofthesmallness ottheenemy whowasdestroying the
world.Hefeltasif,after ajourney ofyears through alandscape of
devastation, pasttheruins ofgreat factories, thewrecks ofpowerful
engines, thebodies ofinvincible men, hehadcome upon thede-
spoiler. expecting tofindagiant—andhadfound arateager toscurry
forcover atthe firstsound ofahuman step. Ifthis iswhat has
beaten us,hethought, theguilt isours.
Hewasjolted back intothecourtroom bythepeople pressing to
surround him.Hesmiled inanswer totheir smiles, tothe frantic,
tragic eagerness oftheir faces; there was atouch ofsadness inhis
smile.
“God bless you,Mr.Rearden!” saidanoldwoman with aragged
shawl over heihead. "Can't yousave us,Mr.Rearden? They're
eating usalive, and it’snousefooling anybody abouthow it’sthe
richthat they’re after -doyouknow what's happening tous?”
“Listen. Mr.Rearden.” said amanwholooked likeafactory
worker, “it's therichwho're selling usdown the river. Tell those
wealthy bastards, who'ic soanxious togiveeverything away, that
when they giveaway their palaces, they’re giving away theskin off
ourbacks.”
“Iknow it.”saidRearden.
The guilt isours, hethought. Ifwewhowere themovers, the
providers, thebenefactors ofmankind, were willing toletthebrand
otevilbestamped upon usand silently tobearpunishment forour
viitues -what sortof“good” didweexpect totriumph intheworld?

“Hank* HInever think that it’shopeless, notever again,'’ said
Dagny thatevening, after the trial. ‘Tilnever betempted toquit.
You’ve proved thattheright always works andalways wins—”She
stopped, thenadded “—provided oneknows what istheright.”
Lillian saidtohim atdinner nextday,"Soyou've won,haveyou?”
Hervoicewasnoncommittal; shesaidnothing else;shewaswatching
him, asifstudying ariddle.
TheWetNurse asked him atthe mills, "Mr. Rearden, what’s a
moral premise?” "What you’re going tohave alotoftrouble with.”
Theboyfrowned, thenshrugged and said, laughing, "God, thatwas
awonderful show! What abeating yougave them, Mr.Rearden! I
satbytheradioandhowled.” "How doyouknow itwasabeating?"
"Well, itwas.wasn’t it?”"Are yousure ofit?”"Sure I’msure.”
"The thing thatmakes yousure isamoral premise.”
Thenewspapers were silent. After theexaggerated attention they
hadgiven tothecase, theyacted asifthe trialwere notworthy of
notice. They printed briefaccounts onunlikely pages, worded insuch
generalities thatnoreader could discover any hintofacontrover-
sialissue.
Thebusinessmen hemetseemed towish toevade thesubject of
histrial.Somemade nocomment atall,hutturned away, their faces
showing apeculiar resentment under theeffort toappear noncom-
mittal asifthey feared that themere actoflooking athimwould
beinterpreted astaking astand. Others ventured tocomment: "In
myopinion, Rearden, itwasextremely unwise ofyou.... Itseems
tomethat this ishardly thelime tomake enemies . . .Wecan’t
afford toarouse resentment."
"Whose resentment?” heasked.
"Idon’t think thegovernment will like it.”
"You sawtheconsequences ofthat."
"Well, i.don't know . ..The public won’t take it,there’s bound
tobealotofindignation.”
"You sawhow thepublic took it."
"Well, 1don’tknow . .We've been trying hard nottogiveany
grounds for allthose accusations about selfish greed—andyou’ve
given ammunition totheenemy.”
"Would yourather agree with theenemy thatyouhavenoright
toyour profits andyourproperty?”
"Oh, no,no,certainly not—butwhygotoextremes? There’s al-
ways amiddle ground.”
"Amiddle ground between youandyour murderers?'
"Now whyusesuchwords?”
"What Isaid atthe trial,was ittrueornot?”
"It’sgoing tobemisquoted andmisunderstood.”
"Was ittrueornot?”
"The public istoodumb tograpple withsuch issues.”
"Was ittrueornot?”
"Itsnotime toboast about being rich—when thepopulace is
starving. It’sjustgoading them ontoseize everything.”
448
“But telling them thatyouhavenoright toyour wealth, while
theyhave— iswhat’s going torestrain them?'’ .
“Well, ldon'tknow ..
“1don’t likethethings yousaid atyour trial,” saidanother man.
inmyopinion, Idon’t agree withyou atall.Personally, I’mproud
tobelieve that 1amworking forthepublic good, notjust formy

“And 1don’t likethatideaabout nodirectives andnocontrols,”
saidanother. “Igrant youthey’re running hog-wild andoverdoing

“Iamsorry, gentlemen,” saidRearden, “that Iwillbeobliged to
saveyourgoddamn necks along withmine.”
Agroup ofbusinessmen headed byMr.Mowen didnotissue any
statements about the trial. Butaweek later theyannounced, with
aninordinate amount ofpublicity, thattheywereendowing thecon-
struction ofaplayground forthechildren oftheunemployed.
Bertram Scudder didnotmention the trial inhiscolumn. Butten
days later, hewrote, among items ofmiscellaneous gossip: “Some
ideaofthepublic value ofMr.Hank Rearden maybegathered from
thefact thatofallsocial groups, heseems tobemost unpopular
with hisown fellow businessmen Hisold-fashioned brand ofruth-
Icssness seems tobetoomuch even forthose predatory barons of

Onanevening inDecember— when thestreet beyond hiswindow
waslikeacongested throat coughing withthehorns ofpre-Christmas
traffic -Rearden satinhisroom attheWayne-Palkland Hotel, fight-
inganenemy more dangerous than weariness ortear: revulsion
against thethought olhaving todealwithhuman beings.
Hesat,unwilling toventure into thestreets ofthecity, unwilling
tomove, as ifhewere chained tohischair and tothisroom.He
hadtried forhours toignore anemotion that feltlikethepullof
homesickness: hisawareness that theonlymanwhom helonged to
sec.washere, inthishotel, justafewfloors above him
Hehadcaught himself, inthepastfewweeks, wasting lime inthe
lobbywhenever heentered thehotel orleft it,loitering unnecessarily
atthemailcounter orthenewsstand, watching thehurried currents
ofpeople, hoping toseeFrancisco d’Anconia among them.Hehad
caught himself eating solitary dinners intherestaurant oftheWayne-
lalkland, with hiseyesonthecurtains oftheentrance doorway.
Nowhecaught himself sitting inhisroom, thinking thatthedistance
wasonly afew floors.
iHerose tohisfeel,with achuckle ofamused indignation; hewas
|Acting, hethought, likeawoman who waits foratelephone calland
fights against thetemptation toendthetorture bymaking the first
move. There wasnoreason, hethought, whyhecould notgoto
Francisco d’Anconia, ifthatwaswhat hewanted. Yetwhen hetold
,himself thathewould, hefeltsome dangerous element ofsurrender
mtheintensity ofhisown relief.
Hemade asteptoward thephone, tocallFrancisco’s suite, but
449
stopped* Itwasnotwhat hewanted; whathewanted wassimply to
walk in,unannounced, asFrancisco hadwalked into hisoffice; itwas
thisthatseemed tostatesome unstated rightbetween them.
Onhiswaytotheelevator, hethought: Hewon’t beinor, ifhe
is,you’ll probably findhim entertaining some floozie, which will
serve you right. Butthethought seemed unreal, hecould notmake
itapply tothemanhehadseen atthemouth ofthefurnace—he
stood confidently intheelevator, looking up—hewalked confidently
down the hall, feeling hisbitterness relax into gaiety—heknocked
atthedoor.
Francisco’s voice snapped, “Come in!” Ithadabrusque, absent-
minded sound.
Rearden opened thedoorandstopped onthethreshold. One ot
thehotel’s costliest satin-shaded lamps stood inthemiddle olthe
floor, throwing acircle oflightonwide sheets ofdrafting paper,
Francisco d’Anconia. inshirt sleeves, astrand ofhairhanging down
over hisface, laystretched onthefloor, onhisstomach, propped up
byhiselbows, biting theendofapencil inconcentration uponsome
point oftheintricate tracing before him.Hedidnotlook up,he
seemed tohave forgotten theknock. Rearden tried todistinguish the
drawing: itlooked likethesection ofasmeltei. Hestood watching in
startled wonder; hadhehadthepower tobring into reality hisown
image ofFrancisco d’Anconia. thiswasthepicture hewould have
seen: thefigure ofapurposeful young worker intent upon adiffi-
cult task.
Inamoment, Francisco raised hishead. Inthenext instant, he
flung hisbody upward toakneeling posture, looking atRearden
withasmile ofincredulous pleasure. Inthenext,heseized thedraw-
ingsandthrew them aside toohastily, facedown.
“What did Iinterrupt?” asked Rearden.
“Nothing much.Come in.”Hewasgrinning happily. Rearden felt
suddenly certain thatFrancisco hadwaited, too,hadwaited torthis
asforavictory which hehadnotquite hoped toachieve,
“What wereyoudoing?” asked Rearden.
“Just amusing myself.”
“Leimesec it.”
“No.” Heroseandkicked thedrawings aside.
Rearden noted that ifhehadresented asimpertinence Francisco’s
manner ofproprietorship inhisoffice, hehimself wasnow guilty ot
thesame attitude— because heoffered noexplanation forhis visit,
butcrossed theroom and satdown inanarmchair, cusually, asifhe
were athome.
“Why didn’t youcome tocontinue what youhadstarted?” he
asked.
“You havebeen continuing itbrilliantly without myjhelp.”
“Doyoumean,mytrial?”
“Imean, your trial.”
“How doyouknow? Youweren’t there.”»
Francisco smiled, because thetone ofthevoice confessed anadded
sentence: Iwaslooking foryou.“Don’t yousuppose ifheard every
word ofitontheradio?”
450
'‘You did?Wellhowdidyou likehearing yourown linescome
over the air,withmeasyourstooge?”
‘You weren't, Mr.Rearden. They weren't mylines. Weren't they
thethings youhadalways livedby?”
“Yes.”
“1onlyhelped youtoseethatyoushould havebeenproud tolive
bythem.”
“Iamgladyouheard it.”
“Itwas great, Mr.Rearden—andabout three generations loo
late,”
“What doyoumean?”
“Ifonesingle businessman hadhadthecourage, then, tosaythat
heworked fornothing buthisown profit—andtosay itproudly—
hewould havesaved theworld.”
“Ihaven't given uptheworld aslost.”
“It isn’t. Itcannever be.ButohGod!* -what hewould have
spared us!”
“Well,1guess wehave tolight, nomatter what erawe’re
caught in.”
“Yes .. .Youknow, Mr.Rearden, Iwould suggest thatyouget
atranscript ofyour trialandreadwhat yousaidThen seewhether
youarepracticing itfullyandconsistently -ornot.”
“Youmean thatI'mnot?”
“See foryourself.”
“Iknow thatyouhad agreat deal totellme,whenwewere
interrupted, thatnight atthemills.Why don’t you finish what you
hadtosay?"
“No. It’stoosoon.”
Francisco acted asifthere were nothing unusual about this visit,
asifhetook itasamatter ofnatural course—ashehadalways acted
inReardon’s presence. ButRearden noted thathewasnotsocalm
ashewished toappear: hewaspacing theroom, inamanner that
seemed arelease foranemotion hedidnotwant toconfess: he
hadforgotten thelamp and itstillstood onthefloor astheroom's
soleillumination.
“You've been taking anawful beating inthewayofdiscoveries,
haven’t you?” said Francisco. “How didyou likethebehavior of
\our fellow businessmen?”
“Isuppose itwastobeexpected.”
Hisvoice tense with theanger ofcompassion, Francisco said, “It’s
beentwelve yearsandyetI'm stillunable tosee itindifferently!” The
sentence sounded involuntarily, asif.trying tosuppress thesound of
emotion, hehaduttered suppressed words.
“Twelve years—sincewhat?” asked Rearden.
There wasaninstant’s pause, butFrancisco answered calmly,
“Since Iunderstood what thosemenwere doing.” Headded, “I
know, what you're going through rightnow . . .andwhat’s still
ahead.”
“Thanks,” saidRearden.
“Forwhat?”
“For what you're trying sohard nottoshow. Butdon't worry
451
about me.I'm stillable tostand it* . ..Youknow, Ididn’t come
herebecause Iwanted totalkabout myself orevenabout thetrial.”
*T11agree toanysubject youchoose—inorder tohaveyouhere.”
Hesaid itinthetone ofacourteous joke; butthetonecould not
disguise it;hemeant it.“What didyouwant totalkabout?”
“You.”
Francisco stopped. Helooked atRearden foramoment, then an-
swered quietly, “AH right.”
Ifthatwhich Rearden feltcould havegone directly intowords,
pastthebarrier ofhiswill,hewould have cried: Don’t letmedown—
Ineedyou—Iamfighting allofthem, 1have fought tomylimitand
amcondemned tolightbeyond it—-and, assoleammunition possible
tome, Ineed theknowledge ofone singlemanwhom Ican trust,
respect andadmire.
Instead, hesaidcalmly, verysimply— andtheonlynote ofaper*
sonal bond between them was thattone ofsincerity which comes
with adirect, unqualifiedly rational statement andimplies thesame
honesty ofmind inthelistener—“You know, 1think thattheonly
realmoral crime thatonemancancommit against another isthe
attempt tocreate, byhiswords oractions, animpression ofthe
contradictory, theimpossible, theirrational, andthusshake thecon-
ceptofrationality inhisvictim.”
“That’s true.”
“If Isaythat that isthedilemma you've putme in,would you
helpmebyanswering apersonal question?”
“Iwill try.”
“Idon’t have totellyou™ lthink youknow it—thatyouarethe
manofthehighest mind 1have ever met. Iamcoming toaccept,
notasright, but atleast aspossible, thefact thatyou refuse to
exercise your great ability intheworld oftoday. Butwhat aman
does outofdespair, rsnotnecessarily akeytohischaracter. 1have
always thought that therealkey isinthatwhich heseeks forhis

you’ve given up,solong asyouchose toremain alive,howcanyou
findanypleasure inspending alifeasvaluable asyours onrunning
aftercheapwomen andonanimbecile’s ideaofdiversions?”
Francisco looked athimwith afinesmile ofamusement, as it
saying: No?You didn’t want totalkabout yourself? Andwhat isit
thatyou’re confessing butthedesperate loneliness which makes the
question ofmycharacter more important toyouthan anyother
question rightnow?
Thesmilemerged into asoft,good-natured chuckle, asiftheques-
tion involved noproblem forhim,nopainful secret toreveal
"There’s away tosolve every dilemma ofthat kind, Mr.Rearden.
Check your premises.” Hesatdown onthe floor, settjing himself
gaily, informally, foraconversation hewould enjoy. “IsJtyourown

“Yes.”
“Doyouknow ofyourown first-hand knowledge thatjl spend my

“Denied it?I’vegone toalotoftrouble tocreate thatimpression*”
“Doyoumean tosaythat itisn’ttrue?”
“Do Istrike youasamanwith amiserable inferiority complex?”
“Good God, no!”

Sitting onthearmofachair, afewfeetaway, Francisco leaned

“Well, whatwould you call it?Co-operating?”
“You were willing towork andproduce Rearden Metal forthem

"What?!”
Itwasascream ofplain shock. Francisco hadshot tohisfeet, past
anyattempt tohide anything. “OnDecember fifth?"
“Yes." saidRearden, stupefied.
Francisco leaped tothetelephone. “Itoldyounottodealwith

despair.

knew only thattherewassomething which Francisco hadthepower

Chapter VACCOUNT OVERDRAWN
Itwasthe first failure inthehistory ofRearden Steel Forthe first
time, anorder wasnotdelivered aspromised. BuibyFebruary 15,
when theTaggart railwasdue, itmade nodifference tnanyone
anylonger.
Winter hadcome early, inthe lastdays ofNovember. ^People said
that itwasthehardest winter onrecord and thatnoo$ecould be
blamed fortheunusual severity ofthesnowstorms. They didnot
care toremember thatthere hadbeen atimewhen snoWstorms did

notsweep, unresisted, down unlighted rends andupon theroofs of
unheated houses, didnotstop themovement oftrains, didnotleave
awake ofcorpses counted bythehundreds.
The firsttime thatDanagger Coalwas lateindelivering fuelto
Taggart Transcontinental, inthelastweek ofDecember, Danagger’s
cousin explained thathecould nothelp it;hehadhadtocutthe
workday down tosixhours, hesaid, inorder toraise themorale of
themenwhodidnotseem tofunction astheyhad inthedays of
hiscousin Kenneth; themenhadbecome listless andsloppy, hesaid,
because theywere exhausted bytheharsh discipline oftheformer
management; hecould nothelp itifsome ofthesuperintendents and
foremen hadquithimwithout reason, menwhohadbeen with the
company fortentotwenty years; hecould nothelp itifthereseemed
tobesome friction between hisworkers and hisnew supervisory
slatf, even though thenewmenweremuch more liberal than the
oldslave drivers; itwasonly amatter ofreadjustment, hesaid.He
could nothelp it,hesaid, ilthetonnage intended forTaggart Trans-
continental hadbeen turned over, ontheeveofitsscheduled deliv-
ery, totheBureau ofGlobal Relic! forshipment tothePeople’s
State ofLngland; itwasanemergency, thepeople o(England were
starving, with alloftheir Slate factories dosing down— -and Miss
Taggart wasbeing unreasonable, since itwasonly amatter ofone
day’s delay,
llwasonlyoneday's delay. Itcaused athree days' delay inthe
runofFreight TrainNumber .*86,bound from California toNew
York with(Uly-nme carloads oflettuce andoranges. Freight Train
Number 386waited onsidings, atcoaling stations, forthefuel that
hadnotarrived. When thetrain reached NewYork, thelettuce and
oranges hadtobedumped intotheHast River: theyhadwaited their
turntoolong inthefreight houses ofCalifornia, withthetrain sched-
ulescutandtheengines forbidden, bydirective, topullatrain of
more than sixty cars.Nobody buttheir friends andtrade associates
noticed thatthree orange growers inCalifornia went outofbusiness,
aswell astwo lettuce farmers inImperial Valley: nobody noticed
Iheclosing ofacommission housemNewYork, ofaplumbing com-
pany towhich thecommission house owed money, ofaleadpipe
wholesaler whohadsupplied theplumbing company. When people
were starving, saidthenewspapers, onedidnothave tofeelconcern
over the failures ofbusiness enterprises which were only private
ventures forprivate profit.
Thecoalshipped across theAtlantic bytheBureau ofGlobal
Relief didnotreach thePeople’s State ofEngland: itwasseized by
Kagnar Danncskjftld.
Thesecond time thatDanagger Coalwas lateindelivering fuelto
Taggart Transcontinental, inmid-January, DanaggeCs cousin snarled
over thetelephone thathecould nothelp it:hismines hadbeen
shutdown forthree days,duetoashortage oflubricating oilforthe
machinery. Thesupply ofcoal toTaggart Transcontinental wasfour
days late.
Mr.Quinn, oftheQuinn BallBearing Company which hadonce
moved ’from Connecticut toColorado, waited aweek forthefreight
459
train thatcarried hisorder toRearden Steel.When thetrain arrived,
thedoors oftheQuinn BallBearing Company’s plant were closed.
Nobody traced theclosing ofamotor company inMichigan, that
badwaited forashipment ofballbearings, itsmachinery idle, its
workers onfullpay;ortheclosing ofasawmill inOregon, thathad
waited foranewmotor, orthedosing ofalumber yard inIowa,

Illinois who, failing togethislumber ontime, found hiscontracts
cancelled andthepurchasers ofhishomes sentwandering offdown
snowswept roads insearch ofthatwhich didnot existanywhere
anylonger.
Thesnowstorm thatcame attheendofJanuary blocked thepasses
through theRocky Mountains, raising white walls thirty feethigh
across themain-line track ofTaggart Transcontinental. Themenwho
attempted toclear thetrack gaveupwithin the firstfewhours: the
rotary plows broke down, one after another: Theplows hadbeen
kept inprecarious repair fortwoyears past thespan oftheir use-
fulness. Thenewplows hadnotbeen delivered: themanufacturer
had quit,unable to'obtain thesteelheneeded fromOrren Boyle.
Three westbound trains were trapped onthesidings ofWinston
Station, high intheRockies, where themain lineofTaggart Trans-
continental cutacross thenorthwest corner ofColorado. For five
days, theyremained beyond thereach ofhelp. Trains could notap-
proach them through thestorm. The lastofthetrucks made by
Lawrence Hammond brokedown onthefrozen grades ofthemoun-
tainhighways. Thebestoftheairplanes oncemade byDwight Sand-
erswere sent out.butnever reached Winston Station; theywere
worn pastthestage offighting astorm.
Through thedriving mesh ofsnow, thepassengers trapped aboard
thetrains looked outatthelights ofWinston's shanties. The lights
died inthenight ofthesecond day.Bytheevening ofthethird, the
lights, theheatandthefoodhadgiven outaboard thetrains. Inthe
brief lullsofthestorm, when thewhite mesh vanished and leftbe-
hind itthe’stiilness ofablack voidmerging alightless earth with a
starless sky—thepassengers could see,many milesaway tothesouth,
asmall tongue offlame twisting inthewind. ItwasWyatt’s Torch
Bythemorning ofthesixth day,when thetrains were able to
move andproceeded down theslopes ofUtah, ofNevada, ofCalifor-
nia,thetrainmen observed thesmokeless stacks andtheclosed doors
ofsmall tracksidc factories, which hadnotbeen closed ontheir
lastrun.
"Storms areanactofGod,*’ wrote Bertram Scudder, "andnobody
canbeheld socially responsible fortheweather.”
The rations ofcoal, established byWesley Mouch, permitted the
heating ofhomes forthree hours aday.There wasnowood toburn,
nometal tomakenew stoves, notools topierce thevialls ofthe
houses fornew installations. Inmakeshift contraptions offbricks and
oilcans, professors were burning thebooks oftheir libraries, and
fruit-growers were burning thetrees oftheir orchards. ^Privations

460
fine steel ofsocial discipline. Sacrifice isthecement which unites
human bricks intothegreat edifice ofsociety/’
“The nation which hadonce held thecreed thatgreatness is
achieved byproduction* isnow told that ilisachieved bysqualor,”
said Francisco d’Ancoma inapress interview. But thiswasnot
printed.
Theonly business boom, that winter, came totheamusement in-
dustry. People wrenched their pennies outofthequicksands oftheir
foodandheat budgets, andwent without meals inorder tocrowd
intomovie theaters, inorder toescape forafewhours thestateof
animals reduced tothesingle concern ofterror over their crudest
needs. InJanuary, allmovie theaters, nightdubs andbowling alleys
were closed byorder ofWesley Mouch. forthepurpose ofconserv-
ingfuel.“Pleasure isnotanessential ofexistence,” wrote Bertram
Scudder.
“You must learn totake aphilosophical attitude,” saidDr.Simon
Pritchett toayoung girlstudent whobroke down intosudden, hys-
terical sobs inthemiddle ofalecture. Shehadjustreturned from a
volunteer relief expedition toasettlement onLake Superior; she
hadseen amother holding thebody ofagrown sonwhohaddied
ofhunger. “There arenoabsolutes,” saidDr.Pritchett. “Reality is
onlyanillusion. Howdoes thatwoman know thatherson isdead?
Howdoes sheknow thatheever existed?”
People withpleading eyesanddespciate facescrowded intotents
where evangelists cried intriumphant gloating thatmanwasunable
tocope with nature, that hisscience wasafraud, that hismindwas
afailure, thathewasreaping punishment forthesinofpride, for
hisconfidence inhisown intellect ~andthatonly faith inthepower
ofmystic secrets could protect himfrom thefissure ofarailorfrom
theblowout ofthe last tireonhislasttruck. Love wasthekeyto
themystic secrets, they cried, loveand selfless sacrifice totheneeds
ofothers.
Orren Boyle made aselfless sacrifice totheneeds ofothers. He
sold totheBureau olGlobal Relief, forshipment tothePeople's
State ofGermany, tenthousand tonsofstructural steelshapes that
hadbeen intended fortheAtlantic Southern Railroad, “tlwasa
difficult decision tomake,” hesaid, with amoist, unfocused lookof
righteousness, tothepanic-stricken president oftheAtlantic South-
ern,“but lweighed thefactthatyou're arichcorporation, while the
people ofGermany areinastate ofunspeakable misery. So lacted
ontheprinciple thatneedcomes first.When indoubt, it’stheweak
thatmustbeconsidered, notthestrong.” Thepresident oftheAtlan-
ticSouthern hadheard thatOrren Boyle’s most valuable friend in
Washington hadafriendmtheMinistry ofSupply ofthePeople/s
State ofGermany. Butwhether thishadbeen Boyle’s motive or
whether ithadbeen theprinciple ofsacrifice, noonecould telland
itmade nodifference: ifBoyle hadbeen asaint ofthecreed of
selflessness, hewould havehad todoprecisely what hehaddone.
Thissilenced thepresident oftheAtlantic Southern; hedared not
admit thathecared forhisrailroad more than forthepeople of
Germany; hedared notargue against theprinciple ofsacrifice.

The waters oftheMississippi hadbeen rising allthrough the
month ofJanuary, swollen bythestorms, driven bythewind intoa
restless grinding ofcurrent andagainst every obstruction intheir
way.Onanight oflashing sleet, inthe firstweek ofFebruary, the
Mississippi bridge oftheAtlantic Southern collapsed under apassen-
gertrain.Theengine andthe first livesleepers wentdown with the
cracking girders intothetwisting black spirals ofwater eighty feet
below. The restofthetrainremained onthe fir-$tthree spans ofthe
bridge, which held.
“You can’thaveyourcakeand letyourneighbor eat it,too,” said
Francisco d’Anconia. The furyofdenunciations which theholders
ofpublic voices unleashed against himwasgreater than theirconcern
over thehorror attheriver.
Itwaswhispered thatthechief engineer oftheAtlantic Southern,
indespair over thecompany’s failure toobtain thesteel heneeded
toreinforce thebridge, hadresigned sixmonths ago, telling thecom-
pany that thebridge was unsafe. Hehadwritten aletter tothe
largest newspaper inNew York, warning thepublic about it;the
letter hadnotbeen printed. Itwaswhispered thatthe firstthree
spans ofthebridge hadheldbecause theyhadbeen reinforced with
structural shapes ofRearden Metal; but fivehundred tons ofthe
Metal was allthattherailroad hadbeen able toobtain under the
FairShare Law.
Asthesole result ofofficial investigations, twobridges across the
Mississippi, belonging tosmaller railroads, werecondemned. Oneof
therailroads went outofbusiness; theother closed abranch line,
toreupitsrailand laidatrack totheMississippi bridge ofTaggart
Transcontinental; sodidtheAtlantic Southern.
The great Taggart Bridge atBedford, Illinois, hadbeen built by
Nathaniel Taggart. Hehadfought thegovernment foryears, because
thecourts hadruled, onthecomplaint ofriver shippers, that rail-
roads were adestructive competition toshipping andthus athreat
tothepublic welfare, andthatrailroad bridges across theMississippi
were tobe'forbidden asamaterial obstruction; thecourts had or-
dered Nathamal Taggart toteardown hisbridge and tocarry his
passengers across theriver bymeans ofbarges. Hehadwon that
battle byamajority ofonevoice ontheSupreme Court. Hisbridge
wasnow theonlymajor link lefttohold thecontinent together. His
lastdescendant hadmade ither strictest rule thatwhatever else
wasneglected, theTaggart Bridge would always bemaintained in
flawless shape.
The steel shipped across theAtlantic bytheBureau ofGlobal
Relief hadnotreached thePeople sState ofGermany. Ithadbeen
seized byRagnar Danneskjdld —butnobody heard of itqutsidc the
Bureau, because thenewspapers hadlong since stopped Mentioning
theactivities ofRagnar Danneskjdld.
Itwasnotuntil thepublic began tonotice thegrowing shortage,
then thedisappearance from themarket ofelectric ironjs, toasters,
washing machines and allelectrical appliances, thatpcopfc began to
askquestions andtohear whispers. They heard thatnoAitploaded
462
withd’Anconia copper wasabletoreach aportoftheUnited States;
itcould notgetpastRagnar Danneskjdld.
Inthefoggy winter nights, onthewaterfront, sailors whispered
thestory thatRagnar Danneskjdld always seized thecargoes ofrelief
vessels, butnever touched thecopper: hesank thed’Anconta ships
with their loads; heletthecrews escape inlifeboats, butthecopper
went tothebottom oftheocean. They whispered itasadarklegend
beyond men’s power toexplain; nobody could findareason why
DanneskjOld didnotchoose tolake thecopper.
Inthesecond week ofFebruary, forthepurpose ofconserving
copper wireand electric power, adirective forbade therunning of
elevators above thetwenty-fifth floor.Theupper floors ofthebuild-
ingshadtobevacated, andpartitions ofunpainted boards wentup
tocutoffthestairways. Byspecial permit, exceptions were granted—
onthegrounds of“essential need”—toafewofthelarger business
enterprises andthemore fashionable hotels. The topsofthecities
were cutdown.
Theinhabitants ofNewYork hadnever hadtobeaware ofthe
weather. Storms hadbeen only anuisance thatslowed thetraffic and
made puddles mthedoorways ofbrightly lighted shops. Stepping
against thewind, dressed inraincoats, fursandevening slippers, peo-
plehad feltthatastorm wasanintruder within thecity.Now. facing
thegusts ofsnow thatcame sweeping down thenarrow streets, peo-
ple felt indim terror thattheywere thetemporary intruders and
thatthewindhadtheright-of-way.
“Itwon'tmake anydifference tousnow, torget it.Hank, itdoesn't
matter,” saidDagny when Rearden toldherthathewould notbe
able todeliver the rail;hehadnotbeen able tofindasupplier of

torget the first failure ofRearden Steel.

Rearden thought that thisboy. ifborn ageneration earlier, would

They satabout apolished table inastately Board room which

cannot givethem thesame service—atleast; notat . . ,ourpresent

seem tonotice. "Itseems tome,” saidTaggart, thesharp edges
becoming sharper inhisvoice, "that thestand taken byourshippers
isunfair, Most ofthem havebeen complaining about their competi-
torsandhavepassed various localmeasures toeliminate competition

ourtrains forthem ataloss, yettheyhave taken astand against

"Against any raise'*" saidMr.Weatherby mildly, with agood imi-
tation ofastonishment. "That isnotthestand theyhave taken.”
"Itcertain rumors, which 1refuse tocredit, aretrue—”saidthe
chairman, andslopped one syllable after thetone ofpanic hadbe-
come obvious inhisvoice.
"Jim,” saidMr.Weatherby pleasantly, "Ithink itwould bebest
ifwejustdidn't mention thesubject ofraising therates.”
iwasn’t suggesting anactual raise atthistime,” saidTaggart
hastily. "Imerely referred to ittoround outthepicture.”
‘But, Jim,” saidanoldman with aquavering voice, "lthought
thatyour influence— Imean, your friendship—with Mr.Mouch
would ensure .”
Hestopped, because theothers were looking athim severely, in
icproof forthebreach ofanunwritten law:onedidnotmention a
failure ofthiskind,onedidnotdiscuss themysterious ways ofJim’s
powerful friendships orwhytheyhad failed him.
"Fact is,”saidMr.Weatherby easily, "that Mr.Mouch sentme
here todiscuss thedemand oftherailway unions foraraise inwages
andthedemand oftheshippers loracutinrates.”
Hesaid itinatoneofcasual firmness; heknew that allthesemen

lheir situation warranted anoulcty ofprotest; there wasnone;
nobody answered him.Then James Taggart said inthat biting, ner-
voustonewhich isintended toconvey anger, butmerely confesses
uncertainty, "1wouldn't exaggerate theimportance ofBuzzy Watts
oltfieNational Shippers Council, He'sbeenmaking alotofnoise
andgiving alotofexpensive dinners inWashington, but Iwouldn’t
advise taking ittooseriously.”
‘Oh, 1don’t know,” saidMr.Weatherby,
465
“Listen, Clem, Tdoknow thatWesley refused toseehim last
week.”
“That's true.Wesley isapretty busyman."
“And lknow thatwhen Gene Lawson gave that bigparty ten
days ago, practically everybody was there, butBuzzy Watts was
notinvited/'
“That's so," saidMr.Weatherby peaceably.
“So Iwouldn’t betonMrBuz/y Walts, Clem.And lwouldn't let
itworry me."
“Wesley’s animpartial man." saidMr.Weatherby. “Aman de-
voted topublic duty, it’stheinterests ofthecountry asawhole that
he'sgottoconsider above everything else." Taggart satup;ofalt
thedanger signs heknew, this lineoftalkwastheworst. “Nobody
candeny it,Jim, thatWesley feels ahigh regard foryou asan
enlightened businessman, avaluable adviser andoneofhisclosest
personal friends." Taggart's eyes shot tohim swiftly: thiswas still
worse. “Butnobody cansaythatWesley would hesitate tosacrifice
hispersonal feelings andfriendships— where thewelfare ofthepublic
isconcerned/’
Taggart’s faceremained blank: histerror came from things never
allowed toreach expression inwords orinfacial muscles. Theterror
was hisstruggle against anunadmitted thought: hehimself hadbeen
“the public" forsolongand insomany different issues, that he
knew what itwould mean ifthatmagic title, thatsacred titlenoone
dared tooppose, were transferred, along with its“welfare," tothe
person ofBuzzy Watts
Butwhat heasked, andheasked ithastily, was,“You're notim
plying that Iwould placemypersonal interests above thepublic
welfare, areyou?"
“No. ofcourse not," saidMr.Weatherby, with alook thatwas
almost asmile. “Certainly not.Notyou, Jim.Your public-spirited
attitude—andunderstanding- -aretoowellknown. That’s whyWes-
leyexpects youtoseeevery sideofthepicture."
“Yes, ofcourse," said Taggart, trapped.
“Well, consider theunions’ sideof it.Maybe you can't afford t<»
givethem araise, buthowcanthey afford toexistwhen thecost ol
living hasshotsky-high? They’ve gottoeat.don’t they7Thatcomes
first, railroad ornorailroad." Mr.Wealherby’s tonehadakind of
placid righteousness, as ifhewere reciting aformula required lu
convey another meaning, dear toallofthem; hewaslooking stiaight
atTaggart, inspecial emphasis oftheunstated. “There arealmost a
million members intherailway unions With families, dependents
andpoor relatives— and,who hasn't gotpoor relatives these days?-
itamounts toabout livemillion voles. Persons, lmean. Wesley has
tobear that inmind.Hehastothink oftheir psychology. And then,
consider thepublic. The rales you’re charging were established ata
timewhen everybody wasmaking money. Butthe things arc
now, thecostoftransportation hasbecome aburden ;nobody can
afford. People arescreaming about itallover thecountry." He
looked straight atTaggart; hemerely looked, buthisglance had the
quality ofawink. “There's anawfuMot ofthem, Jim.They're not
466
veryhappy atthemoment about anawful lotofthings.Agovern-
ment thatwould bring therailroad ratesdown would make alotof
folks grateful.’*
The silence thatanswered himwas like ahole sodeep thatno
sound could beheard ofthethings crashing down toitsbottom.
Taggart knew, asthey allknew, towhat disinterested motive Mr.
Mouch would always beTeady tosacrifice hispersonal friendships.
Itwasthesilence andthefactthatshedidnotwant tosay it,had
come here resolved nottospeak, butcould notresist it,thatmade
Dagny’s voice sound sovibrantly harsh:
“Got what you’ve been asking for, allthese years, gentlemen?”
Theswiftness withwhich their eyesmoved toherwasaninvolun-
tarvanswer toanunexpected sound, buttheswiftness withwhich
theymoved away—tolookdown atthetable, atthewalls, anywhere
butather—wastheconscious answer tothemeaning ofthesounds.
Inthesilence ofthenextmoment, she felttheir resentment like
astarch thickening theairoftheroom, andsheknew that itwas
notresentment against Mr.Weatherby, butagainst her.Shecould
have borne it.iftheyhadmerely letherquestion gounanswered;
butwhatmade her feel asickening tightness inherstomach, was
theirdouble iraud ofpretending toignore herandthen answering
intheirownkind ofmannet.
Thechairman said, notlooking ather, hisvoice pointedly noncom-
mittal, vetvaguely purposeful atthesame time, “Itwould havebeen
allright, everything would haveworked out fine, ititweren't for
thewrong peoplempositions ofpower, such asBu/zy Walts and
Thick Morrison.”
“Oh. Iwouldn’t worn about <hickMorrison,” saidthepallidman
with themustache. “He hasn’t anylop-level connections. Not really.

"Idon’t seethepicture ashopeless,” said aportly manwhowore

Wesley, Iftheir influence prevails, we'll beallright. However, Kip
(halmers andTinky Holloway aredangerous.”
“1cantakecare ofKipChalmers," saidTaggart.
Mr.Weatheihv was theonly person intheroomwho didnot
mind looking atDugny: butwhenever hisglance rested upon her. it
registered nothing; shewas theonlyperson intheroomwhom he
Hulnotsee.
“Iamthinking,” saidMr.Weatherby casually, looking atTaggart,
‘thatyoumight doWesley afavor.”
“Wesley knows thathecanalways count onme."
“Well, mythought isthat ifyougranted theunions’ wage raises—
wemight drop thequestion ofcutting therates, forthetime being.”
“Ican'tdothat!” Itwasalmost acry.“The National Alliance of
Kmlroads hastaken aunanimous stand against theraises andhas
committed everymember torefuse.”
“That’s justwhat 1mean,” saidMr.Weatherby softly. “Wesley
needs todrive awedge into thatAlliance stand. Ifarailroad like
Taggart Transcontinental were togive in,therestwould beeasy.
Youwould helpWesley agreat deal:Hewould appreciate it,”
467
^But*goodGod,Clem!—I’dbeopen tocourt action for it,bythe
Alliance rules!”
Mr.Weatherby smiled. “What court? LetWesley take care of
that”
“But listen, Clem, youknow—youknow justaswell as1do—that
wecan't afford it!”
Mr.Weatherby shrugged. “That’s aproblem foryoutowork out.”
“How, forChrist's sake?”
“1don't know. That's your job,notours.Youwouldn't want the
government tostart telling youhow torunyour railroad, would
you?”
“No, ofcourse not!But—”
“Our job isonly toseethatthepeople getfairwages anddecent
transportation. It'suptoyou todeliver. But,ofcourse, ifyousay
thatyoucan'tdothejob,whythen—”
“lhaven't said it!”Taggart cried hastily. “1haven't said itatall!”
“Good,” saidMr.Weatherby pleasantly. “Weknow thatyouhave
theability tofindsomeway todoit.”
Hewaslooking atTaggart; Taggart waslooking atDagny.
“Well, itwas just athought,” saidMr.Weatherby, leaning back
inhischair inamanner ofmodest withdrawal. “Just athought for
youtomull over. I’monly aguest here. 1don't want tointerfere.
Thepurpose ofthemeeting wastodiscuss thesituation ofthe . ..
branch lines, 1believe?”
“Yes,” saidthechairman andsighed. “Yes.Now ifanyone hasa
constructive suggestion tooffer—”Hewaited; nooneanswered; “I
believe thepicture isclear toallofus.”Hewailed. “Itseems tobe
established thatwccannot continue toafford theoperation ofsome
ofourbranch lines .theRioNorte Line inparticular . . .and,
therefore, some form ofaction seems tobeindicated. ...”
“Ithink,” saidthepallidman with themustache, hisvoice unex-
pectedly confident, “thatweshould nowhearfrom Miss Taggart.”
Heleaned forward with alook ofhopeful craftiness. AsDagny did
notanswer, butmerely turned tohim,heasked, “What doyouhave
tosay.MissTaggart?”
“Nothing.”
“1begyourpardon?”
“All Ihadtosaywascontained inthereport which Jimhasread
toyou.” Shespoke quietly, hervoice clearand flat.
“Butyoudidnotmake anyrecommendations.”
“Ihavenone tomake.”
“But, after all,asourOperating Vice-President, youhave avital
interest inthepolicies ofthisrailroad.”
“Ihavenoauthority over thepolicies ofthisrailroad.”
“Oh, butweareanxious toconsider your opinion.”
“Ihavenoopinions,”
“Miss Taggart,” hesaid,mthesmoothly formal tone ^>fanorder,
“you cannot failtorealize thatourbranch lines arerunning ata
disastrous deficit—and thatweexpect youtomake them pay.”
“How?”
idon’t know. That isyour job,notours.”
468
“thave stated inmyreport thereasons whythat isnowimpossible.

“Oh, Iwouldn’t know.Weexpect youtofindsomewaytomake
itpossible. Ourjob isonty toseethat thestockholders getafair
profit. It'suptoyoutodeliver. Youwouldn't want ustothink that
you’re unable todothejoband—”
“1amunable todo it.’1
Themanopened hismouth, butfound nothing else tosay;he
looked ather inbewilderment, wondering why theformula had
tailed.
“Miss Taggart," asked theman with thegreen muffler, “didyou
imply inyour report thatthesituation oftheRioNorte Linewas
critical?”
“1stated that itwashopeless.”
“Then what action doyoupropose?”
“1propose nothing.”
“Aren’t youevading aresponsibility?”
“What isitthatyouthink you’re doing?” Shespoke evenly, ad-
dressing them all:“Are youcounting onmynotsaying thatthe
responsibility isyours, that itwasyourgoddamn policies thatbrought
uswhere weare? Well, I’msaying it.”
“Miss Taggart, Miss Taggart,” said thechairman inatone of
pleading reproach, “there shouldn’t beanyhard feelings among us.
Does nmatter nowwhowastoblame?Wedon't want toquarrel
over past mistakes. Wemust allpulltogether asateam tocarry our
railroad through thisdesperate emergency.”
Agray- haired man ofpatrician bearing, whohadremained silent
throughout thesession, with alook ofthequietly bitter knowledge
that theentire performance was lufile, glanced atDagny tnaway
which would havebeensympathy hadhestill feltaremnant ofhope.
Hesaid, raising hisvoice justenough tobetray anoteofcontrolled
indignation, “Mr. Chairman, ifitispractical solutions thatwearc
considering, 1should liketosuggest thatwediscuss thelimitation
placed upon thelength andspeed ofour trains. Ofanysingle prac-
tice, that isthemost disastrous one. Itsrepeal would notsolve allof

“Don’t think ofit,”Mr.Weatherby cut insnappily. “Don't try
diearning about anyrepeals. Wewouldn’t consider it.Wewouldn’t
even consider listening toanytalkonthesubject.”
“Mr. Chairman,” thegray-haired man asked quietly, “shall I
continue?”
Thechairman spread outhishands, with asmooth smile, indicating
helplessness. “Itwould beimpractical,” heanswered.
“Ithink we'd better confine thediscussion tothestatus oftheRio
Norte' Line,” snapped James Taggart.
469
There wasalong silence.
Themanwiththegreen muffler turned toDagny. '‘Miss Taggart,”
heasked sadlyandcautiously, “would yousaythat if—this isjusta
hypothetical question—iftheequipment now inuseontheRioNorte
Lineweremade available, itwould filltheneeds ofourtransconti-
nental main-line traffic?”
“Itwould help.”
‘The railoftheRioNorte Line,” said thepallidman with the
mustache, “isunmatched anywhere inthecountry andcould not
nowbepurchased atany price,Wehave three hundred miles of
track, which means wellover fourhundred miles ofvail ofpure
Rearden Metal inthatLine.Would yousay,Miss Taggart, thatwe
cannot afford towaste thatsuperlative railonabranch that carries
nomajor traffic anylonger 7”
“That isforyoutojudge.”
“Letmeput itthisway:would itbeofvalue ifthat railwere
made available forourmain-line track, which ismsuch urgent need
ofrepair?”
“Itwould help”
"Miss Taggart,” asked themanwith thequavering voice, “would
yousaythatthere areanyshippers otconsequence let lontheRio
Norte Line?”
“There’s TedNielsen ofNielsen Motors. Nooneelse”
“Would yousaythat theoperating costs oftheRioNorte Line
could beused torelieve the financial strain onthe rest olthe
system?”
“Itwould help.”
“Then, asourOperating Vice-President . .”Hestopped: she
waited, looking athim; liesaid,“Well?”
“What wasvour question?”
“Imeant tosay ...that is,well, asourOperating Vice-President,
don’t youhave certain conclusions todraw 7”
Shestood up.Shelooked atthefaces around thetable, “Gentle-
men,” shesaid, “Idonotknow bywhat sortofself-fraud youexpect

willbe 1who’ll bear theresponsibility for it.Perhaps youbelieve

Sheturned togo.Thechairman half-rose, asking helplessly, “But",

“Please remain seated. Please continue thediscussion*- andtake
thevote inwhich Ishallhavenovoice. 1shall abstain from voting.
I’llstand by, ifyouwishmeto,butonly asanemployed Iwillnot

Sheturned away once more, but itwasthevoice ofthegray-
haired man thatstopped her.“Miss Taggart, this isnotjanofficial
question, itisonlymypersonal curiosity, butwould you tellmeyour
view ofthefuture oftheTaggart Transcontinental system?”

Sheanswered, looking athim inunderstanding, hervoice gentler,
ihavestopped thinking ofafuture orofarailroad system. 1intend

Idon’t think that itwillbemuch longer.”
Shewalked away from thetable, tothewindow, tostand aside
and letthem continue without her.
Shelooked atthecity.Jimhadobtained thepermit which allowed
them theuseotelectnc power tothetopoftheTaggart Building.
From theheight oftheroom, thecitylooked likeaflattened rem-
nant, withbutatew rare, lonely streaks oflighted glass stillrising
through thedarkness tothesky.
Shedidnot listen tothevoices ofthemenbehind her.Shedid
notknow forhow long thebroken snatches oftheir struggle kept
rolling pasther-thesounds thatnudged andprodded oneanother,
trying toedgebackandleavesomeone pushed forward— astruggle,
nottoassert one'sown will,buttosqueeze anassertion fromsome
unwilling victim—abattle inwhich thedecision was tobepro-
nounced, notbythewinner, butbytheloser:

‘Good God,Clem!” Taggart's crywasopen panic: “Surely there’s

“Iwouldn't betoosure of it.Don’t forget thatyou’re apublic

“Butyouknow that it’simpossible!”
“Well, that's fineforyou, thatsolves your problem, ifyouclose

"What?r screamed Taggart.
“—orsooner.”
“Butyou can’t!OhGod. you can’t! Itwasunderstood thatthe

arecounting onit!”
“An obligation? Aren't youold-fashioned, Jim*7There aren't any
obligations, except thenecessity ofthemoment. The original owners
ofthose bonds were counting ontheir payments, too”
Dagny burst outlaughing.
Shecould notstop heiselt, shecould not resist it,shecould not
reject amoment’s chance toavenge Ellis Wyatt, Andrew Stockton,
Lawrence Hammond, alltheothers She said, tornbvlaughter:
“Thanks, Mr.Weatherby!”
Mr.Weatherby looked ather inastonishment. “Yes?” heasked
coldly.
“Iknew thatwewould have topay forthose bonds onewayor

“Miss Taggart,” saidthechairman severely, “don't youthink that

“All right.” saidJames Taggait. hisvoice choked.
Standing atthewindow', sheheard them voteontheir decision.
Sheheard them declare that theJohn Galt Linewould endmsix
weeks, onMarch 31.
It'sonly amatter ofgetting through thenext fewmoments, she
thought; take care ofthenextfewmoments, andthen thenext, a

Then there wastheassignment ofriding inanelevator down the

Hedidnotquestion herabout theJohn Galt Lineandshedid

“I’m thinking ofthenightwhen NatTaggart was told lhal he
had toabandon thebridge hewas building. Thebridge across the
Mississippi. Hehadbeen desperately short ofmoney- -because peo-
plewere afraid ofthebridge, they called itanimpractical venture
That morning, hewastold that theriver steamboat concerns had
filed suitagainst him.demanding that hisbridge bedestroyed asa

built, advancing across theriver.Thatsame day, alocalmobattacked
thestructure and set firetothewooden scaffolding. Hisworkers
deserted him,some because theywere scared, some because they
were bribed bythesteamboat people, andmost ofthem because he
hadhadnomoney topaythem torweeks. Throughout (hatday,he
kept receiving word thatmenwhohadsubscribed tobuythestock

thecharred wreckage away from thesteel structure. Hischief engi-
neersawhimthere, axe inhand, alone over thewide river, withthe
sunsetting behind him inthewestwhere hislinewas togo.He
woiked there allnight. Bymorning, hehadthought outaplan of
what hewould dotofindtherightmen, themen ofindependent
judgment—tofindthem, toconvince them, toraise themoney, to
continue thebridge.’’
Shespoke inalow, fiatvoice, looking down atthespotoflight
thatshimmered intheliquid asherfingers turned thestem ofher
glassonce inawhile. Sheshowed noemotion, buthervoice hadthe
intense monotone ofaprayer:

andcapable ofknowing it—it’shim that 1would betray if1let it

“Dagnv, ifNatTaggait were living now,whatwould hedo?"
Sheanswered involuntarily, with aswift, bitter chuckle, "He
wouldn't lastaminute!"— thencorrected herself: "No, hewould. He
would findawaytofightthem"
‘‘How?’'
“1don’t know."
Shenoticed some tense, cautious quality intheattentive wayhe
watched herasheleaned forward andasked, "Dagny. themen of

’No, otcourse not."

“How couldmenwho reafraid toholdanunqualified opinion

/‘Yes. Yougave itaway tothem. EllisWyatt did.KenDanagger

Hesmiled. "Who built theJohn GaltLine forthem?"
475
Hesawonly thefaintest contraction ofhermouth, butheknew
that thequestion was likeablow across anopen wound. Yetshe
answered quietly, “1did.”
"For thiskindofend?”
“For themenwhodidnothold out,would notlightandgave up.”
“Don’t youseethatnoother endwaspossible?”
“No,”
“How much injustice areyou wilting totake?”
“Asmuch asTmable tofight.”
“What willyoudonow?Tomorrow?”
Shesaidcalmly, looking straight athimwiththefaintly proud look

“What?”
“TheJohn Galt Line. Start totear itupasgood aswithmyown

“Dagny,” heasked very quietly—andshewondered whatmade

Sheanswered irresistibly. “Then I’dletthe fastengine runover

Hesaidgently. “Iknow youwouldn't. Butyou’d wishyoucould.'
“Yes.”
Hesmiled, notlooking ather; itwasamocking smile, but itwas
asmile ofpainandthemockery wasdirected athimself. Shewon-
dered whatmade hercertain of it;butsheknew hisfacesowell that
shewould always know what hefelt,eventhough shecould notguess
hisreasons anylonger. Sheknew hisface aswell, shethought, asshe

“And toSebastian d’Anconia?” sheasked— -then regretted it,be

Butshesawalook ofodd, bright clarity inhiseyesandhean-

“Yes—andtoSebastian d’Anconia.”
Herhand trembled alittleandshespilled afewdropsbnthesquare

movement ofhishandmade itlook likethegesture jofsome sob

Shethought suddenly that thiswasthe firsttime intwelve years
thathehadcome toherofhisown choice.
Hehadacted asifhewere confidently incontrol, asifhisconfi-
dence were atransfusion toletherrecapture hers,heJiad given her
notime towonder thattheyshould behere together. Nowshe felt,
unaccountably, thatthereinshehadheldwere gone. Itwasonly the
silence ofafewblank moments andthemotionless outline ofhis
forehead, cheekbone andmouth, ashesatwith hisfaceturned away
fromher— butshe feltasifitwerehewhowasnow struggling for
something hehadtorecapture.
Shewondered what hadbeen hispurpose tonight— andnoticed
thathehad, perhaps, accomplished it:hehadcarried herover the
worst moment, hehadgiven heraninvaluable defense against de-
spair— theknowledge that aliving intelligence hadheard herand
understood. Butwhyhadhewanted todoit?Whyhadhecared
about herhour ofdespair—after theyears ofagony hehadgiven
her?Whyhad itmattered tohimhowshewould take thedeath of
theJohn GaltLane? Shenoticed that thiswasthequestion shehad
notasked him inthelobby oftheTaggart Building.
Thiswas thebond between them, shethought: thatshewould
never beastonished ifhecamewhen sheneeded himmost, andthat
hewould always knowwhen tocome. Thiswasthedanger: thatshe
would trust him,even while knowing that itcould benothing but
somenewkind oftrap,even while remembering thathewould al-
ways betray thosewho trusted him.
Hesal.leaning forward with hisarms crossed onthetable, looking
straight ahead. Hesaidsuddenly, notturning toher:
“Iamthinking otthefifteen years thatSehasti&n d'Anconia had
towait forthewoman heloved: Hedidnotknow whether hewould
ever findheragain, whether shewould survive . ..whether she
would wait forhim.Butheknew thatshecould notlivethrough his
battle and thathecould not callhertohim until itwaswon.Sohe
waited, holding hislove intheplace ofthehope which hehadno
right tohold. Butwhen hecarried heracross thethreshold ofhis
house, asthe firstSefiora d’Anconia ofanewworld, heknew that
thebattle waswon, thattheywere free, thatnothing threatened her
andnothing would ever hurtheragain/"
Inthedays oftheir passionate happiness, hehadnever given her
ahint thathewould come tothink ofherasSefiora d’Anconia. For
onemoment, shewondered whether shehadknown what shehad
meant tohim.Butthemoment ended inaninvisible shudder: she
would notbelieve that thepasttwelve years could allow thethings
shewashearing tobepossible. Thiswasthenew trap, shethought.
Francisco/’ sheasked, hervoice hard, “what haveyoudone to
Hank Reardcn?”
Helooked startled thatsheshould think ofthatname atthat
moment, “Why?” heasked.
“He toldmeonce thatyouwere theonlyman he’dever liked.
But lasttime 1sawhim,hesaidhewould killyouonsight/’
“Hedidnot tellyouwhy?"
“No.”

'‘He toldyounothing about it?’'
“No." Shesawhimsmiling strangely, asmile ofsadness, gratitude
andlonging. “Iwarned himthatyouwould hurthim—when hetold
methatyouwere theonlymanheliked."
Hiswords came likeasudden explosion: “Hewastheonlyman—
withoneexception—towhom lcould have givenmylife!"
“Who istheexception?"
“Theman towhom lhave."
“What doyoumean?"
Heshook hishead, asifhehadsaidmore thanheintended, and
didnotanswer.
“What didyoudotoRearden?"
“Ill tellyousome time. Notnow."
“Isthatwhatyoualways dotothosewho ,..mean agreat deal

Helooked atherwith asmile thathadtheluminous sincerity of
innocence andpam.“You know," hesaid gently, “Icould saythat
that iswhat theyalways dotome."Headded, “Rut Iwon’t. The

Hestood up.“Shall wego?HItakeyouhome."
Sheroseandheheldhercoat forher: itwasawide, loose gaimcnt,

Theband ofcrossties swept inwide curves around gianite corners,
dinging tothemountainsides ofColorado. Dagny walked down the
ties,keeping herhands inhercoal pockets, andhereyesonthe
meaningless distance ahead; only thefamiliar movement olstraining
hersteps tothespacing ofthetiesgave herthephysical sense ofan
action pertaining toarailroad,
Agray cotton, which wasneither quite fognorck^uus, hung in
sloppy wads between skyandmountains, making the%kylook like
anoldmattress spilling itsstuffing down thesides ofjthepeaks. A
crusted snow covered theground, belonging neither towinter nor to
47H
spring.Anetofmoisture hung intheair,andshe feltanicypinprick
onherfaceonce inawhile, which wasneither araindrop nora
snowflake. Theweather seemed afraid totake astand andclung
noncommittally tosome sortofroad’s middle; Board ofDirectors’
weather, shethought. The lightseemed drained andshecould not
tellwhether thiswastheafternoon ortheevening ofMarch 31 .But
shewasvery certain that itwasMarch 31;thatwasacertainty not
tobeescaped
Shehadcome toColorado withHank Rearden, tobuywhatever
machinery could stillbefound inthedosed factories. Ithadbeen
likeahurried search through thesinking hulk ofagreat shipbefore
itwas tovanish outofreach. They could have given thetask to
employees, buttheyhadcome, bothprompted bythesame uncon*
fessed motive: theycould notresist thedesire toattend therunof
the last train, asonecannot resist thedesire togivethe lastsalute
byattending afuneral, even while knowing that itisonlyanactof
self-torture.
They hadbeen buying machinery from doubtful owners insales
ofdubious legality, since nobody could tellwhohadtheright to
dispose ofthegreat, dead properties, andnobody would come to
challenge thetransactions. They hadbought everything thatcould
bemoved from thegutted plant ofNielsen Motors. TedNielsen had
quitandvanished, aweek after theannouncement thattheLinewas
tobeclosed.
Shehad felt like ascavenger, buttheactivity otthehunthad
made herable tobear these pastfewdays.When shehadfound
that three empty hours remained before thedeparture ofthe last
train, shehadgone towalk through thecountryside, toescape, the
stillness olthetown Shehadwalked atrandom through twisting
mountain trails, aloneamong rocks andsnow, trying tosubstitute
motion lorthought, knowing thatshehad togetthrough thisday
without thinking otthesummer when shehadridden theengine of
the first train. Butshefound herself walking back along theroadbed
oftheJohn Galt Line—andsheknew thatshehadintended it,that
shehadgone out foithatpurpose.
Itwas aspur track which hadalready beendismembered. There
werenosignal lights, noswitches, notelephone wires, nothing but
alongband ofwooden strips ontheground— achain oftieswithout
rail, liketheremnant ofaspine —and, asitslonely guardian, atan
abandoned grade crossing, apole with slanted arms saying; “Stop.
Look Listen.”
Anearly darkness mixed with fogwasslipping down to fillthe
\alleys, when shecame upon thefactory. There wasaninscription
highonthelustrous tileotitsfiont wall:‘Roger Marsh. Electrical
Appliances." Themanwhohadwanted tochain himself tohisdesk
inorder nottoleave this,shethought. The building stood intact,
hkeacorpse inthat instant when itseyeshave justclosed arulone
Millwaits toseethemopen again. She feltthatthelights would flare
upatanymoment behind thegreat sheets ofwindows, under the
long, flatroofs.Then shesawonebroken pane, pierced byastone
forsomeyoung moron’s enjoyment—andshesawthe tall,drystem
479
ofasingleweed rising from thesteps ofthemain entrance. Hitbya
sadden, blinding hatred, inrebellion against theweed’s impertinence,
knowing ofwhatenemy thiswasthescout, sheranforward, she fell
onherknees andjerked theweed upbyitsroots. Then, kneeling
onthesteps ofadosed factory, looking atthevastsilence ofmoun-
tains, brush anddusk, shethought: What doyouthink you're doing?
Itwasalmost darkwhen shereached theendofthetiesthat led
herback tothetown ofMarshville. Marshville hadbeen theend
oftheLine formonths past; service toWvatt Junction hadbeen
discontinued long ago; Dr. Ferris' Reclamation Project hadbeen
abandoned thiswinter.
The street lights were on,andtheyhung inmid-air attheintersec-
tions, inalong, diminishing lineofyellow globes over theempty
streets ofMarshville. Allthebetter homes were closed—theneat.
Sturdy houses ofmodest cost, well builtand well kept; there were
faded “For Sale” signs ontheir lawns. Butshesaw lights inthe
windows ofthecheap, garish structures thathadacquired, within a
fewyears, theslovenly dilapidation ofslum hovels; thehomes of
people whohadnotmoved, thepeople whonever looked beyond
thespan ofoneweek. Shesaw alargenew television setinthe
lighted room ofahouse with asagging roofandcracking walls. She
wondered howlong theyexpected theelectric power companies of
Colorado toremain inexistence. Then sheshook herhead: those
people hadnever known thatpower companies existed.
Themain street ofMarshville waslined bytheblack windows of
shops outofbusiness. Alttheluxury stores aregone—she thought,
looking attheir signs; andthen sheshuddered, realizing what things
shenow called luxury, realizing towhat extent and inwhatmanner
those things, once available tothepoorest, hadbeen luxuries: Dry
Cleaning—Electrical Appliances— Gas Station— Drug Store -Five
andTen.Theonlyones leftopen were grocery stores andsaloons.
Theplatform oftherailroad station wascrowded. Theglaring arc
lights seemed topick itoutofthemountains, toisolate andfocus
it,likeasmall stage onwhich every movement wasnaked tothe
sight oftheunseen tiers rising inthevast, encircling night. People
were carting luggage, bundling their children, haggling atticket win-
dows, the stilled panic oftheirmanner suggesting thatwhat they
really wanted todowas tofalldown ontheground andscream with
terror. Their terror hadtheevasive quality ofguilt: itwasnotthetear
thatcomes from understanding, butfrom therefusal tounderstand.

Shewalked hastily through thecrowd, trying nottolook atany-
one.Some knewwhoshewas,most ofthem didnot.Shesawan
oldwoman witharagged shawl onhershoulders andthegraph of
alifetime’s struggle onthecracked skin ofher face; thewoman’s
glance wasahopeless appeal foehelp.Anunshaved young manwith
gold-rimmed glasses stood onacrate under anarc light, yelling to
thefaces shifting pasthim,“What dotheymean, nobusiness! Look
atthat train! It’s fullofpassengers! There’s plenty ofbusiness! it’s
justthat there’s noprofits forthem— -that's why they’re letting you
perish, those greedy parasites!” Adisheveled woman rushed upto
Dagny, waving twotickets andscreaming something about thewrong
date.Dagny found herself pushing people outoftheway, fighting
toreach theendofthetrain—butanemaciated man, withthestaring
eyesofyears ofmalicious futility, rushed ather,shouting, “It’s all
right foryou,you’ve gotag(x)d overcoat andaprivate car,butyou
won’t give usany trains, youand allthe selfish Hestopped
abruptly, looking atsomeone behind her.She feltahand grasping
herelbow: itwasHank Rcatdcn. Heheld herarmand ledher
toward her car:seeing thelookonhisface, sheunderstood why
people gotoutoftheir way.Attheendoftheplatform, apallid,
plum pishman stood saying toacrying woman, “That’s how it’s
always been inthisworld. There willbenochance forthepoor,
until thericharedestroyed.” Highabove thetown, hanging inblack
space likeanuncooled planet, theflame ofWyatt’s Torch was twist-
ing irithewind.
Rcardcn went inside hercar,butsheremained onthesteps ofthe
vestibule, delaying thefinality ofturning away. Sheheard the“All

asonelooks atthosewhowatch thedeparture ofthe lastlifeboat.

When lames Taggart telephoned lJllian Rearden fromNewYork
andsaid,“Why, no—nospecial reason, justwondered howyouwere
andwhether youevercame tothecity—haven't seenyouforagesand
justthought wemight have lunch together nexttime you’re inNew

When sheanswered lazily, “Oh, letmesec—what day isthis?

that, Ihavesome shopping todoinNewYork tomorrow, soI’llbe
delighted toletyousavememylunchmoney”— heknew thatshe

purpose ofhertriptothe city,
481
Theymet inadistinguished, high-priced restaurant, much toodis-
tinguished andhigh-priced ever tobementioned inthegossip col-
umns; notthekind ofplace which James Taggart, always eager for
personal publicity, was inthehabit ofpatronizing; hedidnotwant
them toboseen together, sheconcluded.
The half-hint ofhalf-secret amusement remained onherfacewhile
shelistened tohimtalking about their friends, thetheater andthe
weather, carefully building forhimself theprotection oftheunim-
portant. She satgracetully notquite straight, asifshewere leaning
back, enjoying the futility ofhisperformance andthefact thathe
hadtostage itforherbenefit. Shewaited with patient curiosity to
discover hispurpose,
“1dothink thatyoudeserve apatontheback oramedal or
something. Jim.’' she said. “forbeing remarkably cheerful inspite
ofallthemessy trouble you’re having. Didn't youjustclose thebest
branch ofyour railroad‘d’
“Oh. it'sonlyaslight financial setback, nothing more.Onehasto
expect retrenchments atatime like this.Considering thegeneral
stale ofthecountry, we're doing quite well. Beltei than therestof
them." Headded, shrugging, “Besides, it’samatter ofopinion
whether theRioNorte Linewasourbestbranch. Itisonlymysister
whothought so. Itwasherpetproject.”
Shecaught thetone ofpleasure blurring thedrawl othissyllables.
Shesmiled and said, “lsee."
Looking upatherfromunder hislowered forehead, asifstressing
thatheexpected hertounderstand, Taggart asked.“How ishetak-
ingit?"
“Who?” Sheunderstood quite well.
“Your husband."
“Taking what?"
“The closing ofthatLine."
Shesmiled gaily.“Your guess isasgood asmine, Jim -andmine
isverygood indeed/'
“What doyoumean?"
“Youknowhowhewould take itjustasyouknowhowyour sistei
istaking it.Soyour cloud hasadouble silver lining, hasn't it?”
“What hadhebeen saying inthe lastfewdays?"
“He's been awaymColorado forover aweek, so I—"She
stopped; shehadstarted answering lightly, butshenoticed that \ag~
gart's question hadbeen toospecific while histonehadbeen too
casual, andsherealized thathehadstruck the firstnote leading
toward thepurpose oftheluncheon, shepaused lorthebriefest
instant, then finished, stillmore lightly, “so Iwouldn't know. But
he’scoming backanydaynow."
“Would yousay that hisattitude isstillwhat one '(might call
recalcitrant?"
“Why, Jim, thatwould beanunderstatement!"r
“Itwas tobehoped thatevents had, perhaps, taugfit him the
wisdom ofamellower approach."r
Itamused hertokeephim indoubt about herunderstanding. “Oh
482
yes,” shesaid innocently, “itwould bewonderful ifanything could
evermake himchange.”
“He ismaking things exceedingly hard forhimself-”
“Healways has.”
“But events have awayofbeating usallintoamore ...pliable
frame ofmind, sooner orlater.”
“I’ve heardmany characteristics ascribed tohim,but‘pliable' has
never beenoneofthem.5’
“Well, things change andpeople change withthem. After all, itis
alawofnature thatanimals must adapt themselves totheir back-
ground. And Imight addthat adaptability istheonecharacteristic
most stringently required atpresent bylaws other than those of
nature. We’re inforavery difficult time, and 1would hale tosee
you suffer theconsequences ofhisintransigent attitude. Iwould
hate—asyour friend—toseeyou inthekindofdanger he’sheaded
lor,unless helearns tocooperate.”
“How sweet ofyou,Jim,” shesaidsweetly.
Hewasdoling hissentences outwithcautious slowness, balancing
himself between word andintonation tohitthe-rightdegree ofsemi-
clarity. Hewanted hertounderstand, buthedidnotwant herto
understand fully, explicitly, down totheroot—since theessence of
thatmodern language, which hehadlearned tospeak expertly, was
never toletoneself orothers understand anything down totheroot.
Hehadnotneeded many words tounderstand Mr.Weatherby.
Onhislast triptoWashington, hehadpleaded withMr.Weatherby
thatacut intherates oftherailroads would beadeathblow; the
wage raises hadbeen granted, butthedemands forthecutinrates
were stillheard inthepress- -andTaggart hadknown what itmeant,
itMr.Mouch stillpermitted them tobeheard; hehadknown that
theknifewas stillpoised athisthroat. Mr.Weatherby hadnotan-
swered hispleas, buthadsaid, inatoneofidlyirrelevant speculation,
“Wesley hassomany tough problems. Ifheistogiveeverybody a
breathing spell, financially speaking, he’sgottoputintooperation a
certain emergency program ofwhich youhavesome inkling. Butyou
know what helltheunprogressive elements ofthecountry would

torsomebody whocould keepReardon inline.But Iguess that’s
something nobody candeliver. 'Hiough Imaybewrong Youmay
know better, Jim, since Rearden isasortoffriend ofyours,who
comes toyour parties and allthat.”
Looking atUllian across thetabic, Taggart said, “Friendship, 1
lind, isthemost valuable thing inlife—and iwould beamiss ifI
didn't giveyouproof ofmine.”
"But I'venever doubted it.”
Helowered hisvoice tothetone ofanominous warning: “Ithink
iIshould tellyou, asafavor, toafriend, although it’sconfidential,
Ithatyour husband’s attitude isbeing discussed inhigh places—very
1highplaces. I’msureyouknow what lmean.”
Thiswaswhyhehated Lillian Rearden, thought Taggart: sheknew
Ihegame, butsheplayed itwithunexpected variations ofherown.
483
itwasagainst allrules tolook athimsuddenly, tolaugh inhisface,
and—after allthose remarks showing thatsheunderstood too little—
tosaybluntly, showing thatsheunderstood toomuch. “Why, darling,
ofcourse lknow whatyoumean. Youmean that thepurpose of

“The sortofperformance heputonathistrialwashardly what

“Ohmy.no, itwasn’t," shesaid placidly. “Itcertainly wasn't. But,

“But it'strue. Iheard himdiscussed, so lthought I'dtellyou."
“I'm sure it’strue. Iknow thattheywould bediscussing him. I

“Lillian/' hesaid nervously, “lmeant itwhen Isaid that 1was

Shelaughed. “There isn’t. Iknow youmean it.Butthere's nothing

“But thenwhyshould youwant todo itatall?What areyou

Sheleaned back, smiling. “This lunch. Justseeing y^uhere. Just

Anangry spark flashed inTaggart’s veiled eyes, the|i hiseyelids
narrowed slowly andhe,too,leaned back inhischairf hisface re-
laxing toafaintlookofmockery and satisfaction. Eveit from within

ofvalues, hewasable torealize which oneofthemwasthemore
dependent ontheother andthemore contemptible.
When theyparted atthedoor oftherestaurant, shewent toRear*
den's suite attheWayne-Falkland Hotel, where shestayed occasion-
ally inhisabsence. Shepaced theroom forabout halfanhour* in
aleisurely manner ofreflection. Then shepicked upthetelephone,
with asmoothly casual gesture, butwith thepurposeful airofa
decision reached. Shecalled Rearden’s office atthemillsandasked
Miss Iveswhen sheexpected him toreturn.
“Mr. Rearden willbeinNewYork tomorrow, arriving onthe
Comet, Mrs,Rearden,” saidMiss Ives’ clear, courteous voice.
“Tomorrow? That's wonderful. Miss Ives,would youdomea
favor? Would you callGertrude atthehouse and tellhernotto
expect mefordinner? I’mstaying inNewYork overnight.”
Shehung up,glanced atherwatch andcalled the florist ofthe
Wayne-Falkland. “This isMrs.Henry Rearden,” shesaid. “1should
liketohavetwodozen Rises delivered toMr.Rearden’s drawing
room aboard theComet. . . .Yes, today, thisafternoon, when the
Cornel reaches Chicago. . . .No, without anycard—just the
flowers. . ..Thank youeversomuch.”
Shetelephoned James Taggart. “Jim. willyousendmeapass
toyour passenger platforms? Iwant tomeetmyhusband atthe
station tomorrow”
Shehesitated between Balph Eubank andBertram Scudder, chose
Balph Eubank, telephoned himandmade adate forthisevening’s
dinner andamusical show. Then shewent totake abath, and lay
relaxing inatubofwarm water, reading amagazine devoted to
problems ofpolitical economy.
Itwas lateafternoon when the florist telephoned her.“Our Chi-
cago office sentword thattheywere unable todeliver theflowers,
Mrs.Rearden,” hesaid, “because Mr.Rearden isnotaboard the
Comet.”
“Are yousure?” sheasked.
“Quite sure, Mrs.Rearden. Ourmanfound atthestation inChi-
cago thatthere wasnocompartment onthetrain reserved inMr.
Rearden's name.Wechecked with theNewYork office ofTaggart
Transcontinental, justtomake certain, andwere toldthatMr.Rear-
den'sname isnotonthepassenger listoftheComet.”
“Isee. ...Then cancel theorder, please. . ..Thank you.”
She satbythetelephone foramoment, frowning, then called Miss
Ives.“Please forgive meforbeing slightly scatterbrained. Miss Ives,
but 1wasrushed anddidnotwrite itdown, andnow I’mnotquite
certain otwhatyou said.DidyousaythatMr,Rearden wasaiming
backtomorrow? OntheComet?”
“Yes, Mrs.Rearden.”
“You have notheard ofanydelay orchange inhisplans?”
“Why, no.Infact. 1spoke toMr.Rearden about anhour ago.He
telephoned from thestation inChicago, andhementioned thathe
hadtohurry back aboard, astheComet wasabout toleave.”
“fsee.Thank you.”
Sheleaped toherfeetassoon astheclick oftheinstrument re-

unrhythm ieally tense.Then shestopped, struck byasudden thought.
There wasonlyonereason why amanwould make atrain reserva-
tionunder anassumed name: ifhewasnottraveling alone.
Her facial muscles went flowing slowly intoasmile ofsatisfaction:
thiswasanopportunity shehadnotexpected.

Standing ontheTerminal platform, atapoint halfway down the
length ofthetrain, Lillian Rearden watched (hepassengers descend-
ingfrom theComet. Hermouth held thehintofasmile: there was
aspark ofanimation inher lifeless eyes; sheglanced fromoneface
toanother, jerking herhead withtheawkward eagerness ofaschool-
girl.Shewasanticipating thelookonRearden’s facewhen, with his
mistress beside him,hewould seeherstanding there.
Herglance darted hopefully toevery flashy young female stepping
offthe train. Itwashard towatch: within aninstant after the first
fewfigures, thetramhadseemed toburst attheseams, flooding the
platform with asolid current thatswept inonedirection, asifpulled
byavacuum; shecould barely distinguish separate persons. The
lights weremore glare than illumination, picking thisone strip out
ofadusty, oilydarkness. Sheneeded aneftoit tostand stillagainst

inafuryofincredulous disappointment, shelooked frantically for
an>single feminine figure hecould have leftbehind. She feltcertain
thatshewould recognize hischoice. Shesawnone thatcould be
possible. Andthenshesawthatthelastcarofthetrainwasaprivate

official—afigure wearing, notminks and veils, butarough sports

confident posture ofthis station's owner andcenter—wasDagny
Taggart. Then Lillian Rearden understood.
“Lillian! What's thematter?’'
Sheheard Rearden’s voice, she felthishand grasping herarm;she
sawhimlooking atherasonelooks attheobject ofasudden emer-
gency. Hewaslooking atablank faceandanunfocused glance
ofterror.
“What happened? What areyoudoing here?”
“I . ..Hello, Henry ... Ijustcame tomeetyou . . .Npspecial

“1missed you,Henry. Iknow what 1amconfessing: But Idon’t

andpurpose wasreturning toherface.
Hetook herarm,butshedrew back, alittle toosharply.
“Aren't yougoing tosayaword tome,Henry?”
‘‘What doyouwishmetosay?”
“Doyouhate itasmuch asthat—having your wifecome tomeet

waswalking toward them; hedidnotseeher.
“Let's go,”hesaid.
Shewould notmove.“Doyou?” sheasked.
“What?”
“Doyouhate it7”
“No, Idon't hate it. Imerely don't understand it.”
“Tellmeabout your trip.I'msureyou've hadaveryenjoyable

“Come onWecantalk athome.”
“When do 1everhave achance totalktoyou athome?” Shewas
drawling herwords impassively, asifshewere stretching them tofill

catch afewmoments ofyour attention- -like this—between trains
andbusiness appointments and allthose important matters thathold

Hello, MissTaggart!” shesaid sharply, hervoice loudand bright.
Reardon whirled around. Dagny waswalking pastthem, butshe

“How doyoudo,” shesaid toLillian, bowing, herfaceexpress-

“1amsosorry. Miss Taggart,” said Lillian, smiling, “you must

greeted each other. “You’re returning fromwhat was, ineffect, the
funeral ofyour child bymyhusband, aren't you?”
Dagny’s mouth showed afaint lineofastonishment andofcon-
tempt. Sheinclined heihead, bywayofleave-taking, andwalked on.
Lillian glanced sharply atRcarden’s face, asifindeliberate em-
phasis. Helooked atherindifferently, puz/led.

some uncustomary violence was racing within her.Hehadnever

Shewhirled tofacehim, themoment theywere alone inhisroom.
“So that'swho itis?”sheasked.
Hehadnotexpected it.Helooked ather,notquite believing that

“Yes.” heanswered calmly.
Hermouth twisted intoanuglychuckle: shewasstaring pasthim.

“Lillian, ifyouwish todiscuss it.there’s onething you’d better

“But Idemand it!”
“Itoldyouthatyoucoulddemand anything butthat.”,
Hesawthelook ofapeculiar panic growing inhercy£s: itwas

Itwasthelookonhisface thatdrove heruptherising steps of

Chapter V!MIRACLE METAL
“But canwegetaway with it?”asked Wesley Mouch. Hisvoice was
high withanger and thinwith fear.
Nobody answered hint.James Taggart satontheedge ofanarm-
chair notmoving looking upathimfromunder hisforehead. Orrcn
Boyle gave avicious tapagainst anashtray, shaking theashoffhis
cigar. Dr.Floyd Ferris smiled Mr.Weathcrby folded hislipsand
hands. Fred Kinnan, head oftheAmalgamated Labor ofAmerica,
slopped pacing theoffice, satdown onthewindow sillandcrossed
hisarms. Eugene L^awson, whohadsathunched downward, absent-
mindedly rearranging adisplay offlowers onalowglass table, raised
historso resentfully andglanced up.Mouch satathisdesk, with his
fistonasheet ofpaper.
ItwasEugene Lawson whoanswered. “That’s not, itseems tome,
theway toput it.Wemust not letvulgar difficulties obstruct our
feeling that it’sanoble planmotivated solely bythepublic welfare.
It’s fen*thegood ofthepeople. Thepeople need it.Needcomes first*
sowedon’t have toconsider anything else.”
491
Nobody objected orpicked itup;theylooked asifLawson had
merely made itharder tocontinue thediscussion. Butasmallman
who satunobtrusively inthebestarmchair oftheroom, apart from
theothers, content tobeignored and fullyaware thatnone ofthem
could beunconscious ofhispresence, glanced atLawson, then at
Mouch, andsaidwith brisk cheerfulness, “That’s the line,Wesley.
Tone itdown anddress itupandgetyour press boys tochant it—
andyouwon’t have toworry.”
“Yes, Mr.Thompson,” saidMouch glumly.
Mr.Thompson, theHead oftheState, wasamanwhopossessed
thequality ofnever being noticed. Inanygroup ofthree, hisperson
became indistinguishable, andwhen seen alone itseemed toevoke
agroup ofitsown,composed ofthecountless persons heresembled.
Thecountry hadnodearimage ofwhat helooked like/ hisphoto-
graphs hadappeared onthecovers ofmagazines asfrequently as
those ofhispredecessors inoffice, butpeople could never bequite
certain which photographs were hisandwhich were pictures of“a
mail clerk” or“nwhite-collar worker,” accompanying articles about
thedaily lifeoftheundifferentiated —except thatMr.Thompson’s
collars were usually wilted. Hehadbroad shoulders and aslight
body.Hehadstringy hair, awidemouth andanelastic agerange
thatmade himlook likeaharassed forty oranunusually vigorous
sixty. Holding enormous official powers, heschemed ceaselessly to
expand them, because itwasexpected ofhimbythose \vhohad
pushed himinto office. Hehadthecunning oftheunintelligent and
thefrantic energy ofthelazy.The sole secret ofhisrise inlifewas
thefactthathewas aproduct ofchance andknew itandaspired to
nothing else.
“It’sobvious thatmeasures have tobetaken. Drastic measures,”
saidJames Taggart, speaking, nottoMr.Thompson, buttoWesley
Mouch. “We can’t letthings gothewaythey’re goingmuch longer.”
Hisvoicewasbelligerent andshaky.
“Take itefcsy, Jim,” saidOrren Boyle.
“Something’s gottobedone anddone fast!”
“Don’t look atme,” snapped Wesley Mouch. “Ican’t help it. I
can’t help itifpeople refuse toco-operate. I’m tied. Ineed wider
powers.”
Mouch hadsummoned them alltoWashington, ashisfriends and
personal advisers, foraprivate, unofficial conference onthenational
crisis. But,watching him, theywere unable todecide whether his
manner wasoverbearing orwhining, whether hewasthreatening
them orpleading fortheir help.
“Fact is,”saidMr.Weathcrby primly, inastatistical torn? ofvoice,
“that inthetwelve-month period ending onthe firstofthi$year, the
rateofbusiness failures hasdoubled, ascompared with thejpreceding
twelve-month period. Since the firstofthisyear, ithastrebled.”
“Besurethey think it’stheirown fault,” saidDr.Ferri£ casually.
“Huh?” saidWesley Mouch, hiseyes darting toFerris.?
“Whatever youdo,don’t apologize,” saidDr.Ferris. “Make them
feelguilty.”
492
‘Tm notapologizing!” snapped Mouch. ‘Tinnottoblame. 1need
wider powers/’
“But itistheirown fault,” saidEugene Lawson, turning aggros*-
sivcly toDr. Ferris. “It’s their lackofsocial spirit. They refuse to
recognize thatproduction isnotaprivate choice, butapublic duty.
They havenoright tofail,nomatter what conditions happen to
come up.They’ve gottogoonproducing. It’sasocial imperative.
Aman’s work isnotapersonal matter, it’sasocial matter. There’s
nosuch thing asapersonal matter—orapersonal life. That's what
we’ve gottoforcethem tolearn.”
“Gene Lawson knows what I’mtalking about,” said Dr.Ferris,
with aslight smile, “even though hehasn’t thefaintest idea that
hedoes.”
“What doyouthink youmean?” asked Lawson, hisvoice rising.
“Skip it,”ordered Wesley Mouch.
“1don’t carewhatyoudecide todo.Wesley,” saidMr.Thompson,
“and Idon’t care ifthebusinessmen squawk about it.Justhesure
you’ve gotthepress with you.Bedamn sureabout that.”
“I’ve got’em,” saidMouch.
“One editor who’d open histrap atthewrong timecould dous
moreharm than tendisgruntled millionaires.”
“That’s true, Mr.Thompson/' saidDr.Ferris. “But canyouname
oneeditor whoknows it?”
“Guess not/’ saidThompson; hesounded pleased.
“Whatever type otmenweTe counting onandplanning for,” said
Dr.Ferris, “there’s acertain old-fashioned quotation which wcmay
safely forget: theoneabout counting onthewiseandthehonest.
Wedon’t have toconsider them. They’re outofdate.”
James Taggart glanced atthewindow There were patches ofblue
intheskyabove thespacious streets ofWashington, thefaintblue
ofmid-April, andafewbeams breaking through theclouds.Amonu-
ment stood shining inthedistance, hitbyarayofsun: itwasatall,
white obelisk, erected tothememory oftheman Dr.Ferris was
quoting, theman inwhose honor this cityhadbeen named. James
Taggart looked away.
“1don't liketheprofessor’s remarks.” saidLawson loudly and
sullenly.
“Keep still,” saidWesley Mouch. “Dr. Ferris isnottalking theory,
butpractice.”
“Well, ifyouwant totalkpractice,” saidFred Kinnan, “then let
me tellyou thatwecan’t worry about businessmen atatime like
this.What we’ve gottothink about isjobs.More jobs torthepeople.
Inmyunions, everymanwho’s working isfeeding fivewho aren't,

advice—oh, Iknow youwon’t gofor it,but it’sjustathought—issue
adirective making itcompulsory toadd, say,onc~third moremen

‘Good God!” yelled Taggart. “Are youcrazy?Wecanbarely
meet ourpayrolls as itis!There’s notenough work forthemen
we’ve* gotnow! One-third more?Wewouldn’t haveanyusefor
them whatever!”
493
“Who cares whether you’d have anyuseforthem?” saidFred
Kinnan. “They need jobs. That’s whatcomes first— need—doesn’t
it?—notyour profits.”
“It’snotaquestion ofprofits!” yelled Taggart hastily. “Ihaven’t
saidanything about profits. Ihaven’t given youanygrounds toinsult
me. It’sjustaquestion ofwhere inhellwe’d getthemoney topay
yourmen—when halfourtrains arerunning empty and there’s not
enough freight tofillatrolley car.” Hisvoice slowed down suddenly
toatone ofcautious thoughtfulness: “However, wedounderstand
theplight oftheworking men, and—it’sjustathought—wecould,
perhaps, takeonacertain extra number, ifwewere permitted to
double ourfreight rates, which—”
“Have you lostyourmind?” yelled Orren Boyle. “I’mgoing broke
ontherates you’re charging now, 1shudder every time adamn
boxcar pulls inoroutofthemills, they’re bleeding metodeath, 1
can’t afford it—andyouwant todouble it?”
“It isnotessential whether youcanafford itornot,” saidTaggart
coldly. “You have tobeprepared tomakesome sacrifices. Thepublic
needs railroads. Need comes first—above your profits.”
“What profits?” yelled Orren Boyle. “When did 1evermake any
profits? Nobody canaccuse meofrunning aprofit-making business!
Justlook atmybalance sheet—andthen look atthebooks ofa
certain competitor ofmine, who’s got allthecustomers, alltheraw
materials, allthetechnical advantages and amonopoly onsecret

public doesneed railroads, andperhaps Icould manage toabsorb a
certain raise inrales, ifIwere toget—it’sjustathought— ifIwere
togetasubsidy tocarrymeover thenextyearortwo, until Icatch

“What? Again?” yelled Mr.Weatherby, losing hisprimness. “How
many loans haveyougotfrom usandhowmany extensions, suspen-
sionsandmoratoriums? You haven’t repaid apenny—andwith all
ofyouboysgoing broke andthetaxreceipts crashing, where doyou

“There arcpeople who aren’t broke,” saidBoyle slowly. “You

“Ican’t help it!”yelled Wesley Mouch. “Ican’tdoanything about
it! Ineed wider powers!”
They could not tellwhat hadprompted Mr.Thompson toattend
thisparticular conference. Hehadsaid little, buthadlistened with
interest. Itseemed asifthere wassomething which hehadwanted
tolearn, andnowhelooked asifhehadlearned it.Hestood up
andsmiled cheerfully.
“Go ahead, Wesley,” hesaid.“Goahead withNumber 10-289.
Youwon’t haveanytrouble atall.”
They had allrisen totheir leel, ingloomily reluctant Reference.
Wesley Mouch glanced down athissheet ofpaper, then! said ina
petulant toneofvoice, “Ifyouwantmetogoahead, you)l have to
declare astate oftotalemergency.”
“I’lldeclare itanytime you’re ready.”

‘"There arecertain difficulties, which—”
“HIleave ittoyou.Work itoutanywayyouwish. It’syour job.
Letmeseetherough draft, tomorrow ornextday,butdon’t bother
meabout thedetails. I’vegotaspeech tomake ontheradio inhalf
anhour.”
“The chief difficulty isthatFmnotsurewhether thelawactually
grants usthepower toputinto effect certain provisions ofDirective
Number 10-289. Ifeartheymight beopen tochallenge.”
“Oh, hell,we’ve passed somany emergency laws that ifyouhunt
through them, you’re sure todigupsomething that willcover it.”
Mr.Thompson turned totheothers withasmile ofgood fellow-
ship. “I’llleave youboys toironoutthewrinkles,” hesaid, “fap-
preciate yourcoming toWashington tohelp usout.Glad tohave
seenyou.”
They waited until thedoor closed after him,thenresumed their
seals; they didnotlook atoneanother.
They hadnotheard thetext ofDirective No.10-289. butthey
knew what itwould contain. They hadknown itforalong time, in
thatspecial manner which consisted ofkeeping secrets from oneself
andleaving knowledge untranslated intowords. And, bythesame
method, theynowwished itwere possible forthem nottohear the
words ofthedirective. Itwastoavoidmoments such asthisthat all
thecomplex twistings oftheirminds hadbeen devised.
They wished thedirective togointo effect. They wished itcould
beputinto effect without words, sothattheywould nothave to
know thatwhat theywere doing waswhat itwas.Nobody hadever
announced thatDirective No.10-289 wasthefinal goalofhisefforts.
Yet, forgenerations past,menhadworked tomake itpossible, and
lormonths past, every provision of ithadbeen prepared forbycount-
lessspeeches, articles, sermons, editorials—bypurposeful voices that
screamed withanger ifanyone named their purpose.
“The picture now isthis,” saidWesley Mouch. “The economic
condition ofthecountry wasbetter theyearbefore lastthan itwas
lastyear,and lastyear itwasbetter than itisatpresent. It’sobvious
thatwewould notbeable tosurvive another year ofthesame pro-
gression. Therefore, oursoleobjective mustnowbetohold thefine.
Tostand still inorder tocatch ourstride.Toachieve total stability.
Freedom hasbeen given achance andhas failed. Therefore, more
stringent controls arenecessary. Sincemen areunable andunwilling
tosolve theirproblems voluntarily, theymust beforced todoit.”
Hepaused, picked upthesheet ofpaper, thenadded inalessforma!
tone ofvoice, “Hell, what itcomes down toisthatwecanmanage
toexist asandwhere weare,butwecan’t afford tomove! Sowe’ve
gottostand still.We’ve gottostand still.We’ve gottomake those
bastards stand still!”
Hisheaddrawn into hisshoulders, hewaslooking atthem with
theanger ofaman declaring that thecountry’s troubles were a
personal affront tohim.Somanymenseeking favors hadbeen afraid
ofhimthathenowacted asifhisanger were asolution toeverything,
asifhisanger were omnipotent, asifallhehadtodowas toget
angry. Yet, facing him, themenwho satinasilent semicircle before
495
hisdeskwere uncertain whether thepresence offear intheroom
was theirownemotion orwhether thehunched figure behind the
deskgenerated thepanic ofacornered rat.
Wesley Mouch hadalong, square faceandaflat-topped skull,
mademore sobyabrush haircut. Hislower lipwasapetulant bulb
andthepale, brownish pupils ofhiseyeslooked liketheyolks of
eggssmeared under thenotfully translucent whites. His facial mus-
clesmoved abruptly, andthemovement vanished, having conveyed
noexpression. Noonehadeverseenhimsmile.
Wesley Mouch came from afamily thathadknown neither poverty
norwealth nordistinction formany generations; ithadclung, how-
ever, toatradition ofitsown: thatofbeing college-bred and, there-
fore, ofdespising menwhowere inbusiness. The family’s diplomas
hadalways hungonthewall inthemanner ofareproach tothe
world, because thediplomas hadnotautomatically produced the
material equivalents oftheir attested spiritual value.Among thefam-
ily’snumerous relatives, there wasone rich uncle. Hehadmarried
hismoney and, inhiswidowed oldage,hehadpicked Wesley ashis
favorite fromamong hismany nephews andnieces, because Wesley
wastheleast distinguished ofibe lotandtherefore, thought Uncle
Julius, the safest. Uncle Julius didnotcare forpeople whowere
brilliant. Hedidnutcare forthetrouble ofmanaging hismoney,
either; soheturned thejobover toWesley. BythetimeWesley
graduated from college, therewasnomoney tomanage. Uncle Julius
blamed itonWesley’s cunning andcried thatWesley wasanunscru-
pulous schemer. Butthere hadbeen noscheme about it;Wesley
could nothave said justwhere themoney hadgone. Inhigh school,
Wesley Mouch hadbeenoneoftheworst students andhadpassion-
ately envied thosewhowere thebest. College taught him thathe
didnothave toenvythem atall.After graduation, hetook ajobm
theadvertising department ofacompany thatmanufactured abogus
corn-cure. Thecure sold wellandherose tobethehead olhis
department. He left ittotakecharge oftheadvertising ofahair-
restorer, then ofapatented brassiere, then ofanew soap, then of
asoftdrink—andthen hebecame advertising vicepresident ofan
automobile concern. Hetried tosellautomobiles asiftheywere a
bogus corn-cure. They didnot sellHeblamed itontheinsufficiency
ofhisadvertising budget. Itwasthepresident oftheautomobile
concern whorecommended him toReardon. ItwasRearden who
introduced himtoWashington —Rearden, whoknew nostandard by
which tojudge theactivities ofhisWashington man. ItwasJames
Taggart whogavehimastart intheBureau ofEconomic Planning
andNational Resources—inexchange fordouble-crossing Rearden
inorder tohelpOrren Boyle inexchange fordestroying PanCon-
way,From then on,people helped Wesley Mouch toadvance, for
thesame reason asthatwhich hadprompted Unde Julius: theywere
people who believed thatmediocrity was safe.Themen )whonow
satinfront ofhisdeskhadbeen taught thatthelawofcausality was
asuperstition andthatonehad todeal with thesituation ofthe
moment without considering itscause. Bythesituation ofthemo-
ment, theyhadconcluded thatWesley Mouch wasamanofsuperla-
496
tive skillandcunnings since millions aspired topower, buthewas
theonewhohadachieved it.Itwasnotwithin theirmethod of
thinking toknow thatWesley Mouch wasthezero atthemeeting
point offorces unleashed indestruction against oneanother.
“This isjustarough draft ofDirective Number 10-289," said
Wesley Mouch, “which Gene, Clem and Ihave dashed offjust to
giveyouthegeneral idea.Wewant tohearyour opinions, sugges-
tionsandsoforth— youbeing therepresentatives oflabor, industry,
transportation andtheprofessions."
FredKinnan gotoffthewindow silland satdown onthearmof
achair. Orren Boyle spitoutthebuttofhiscigar. James Taggart
looked down athisown hands. Dr.Ferris wastheonlyonewho
seemed tobeatcase.
“Inthename ofthegeneral welfare/’ readWesley Mouch, “to
protect thepeople’s security, toachieve fullequality andtotal stabil-
ity. itisdecreed fortheduration ofthenational emergency that—

There was,even within thefourmenwhohadlistened, aremnant
ofhuman dignity, which made them siL stilland feci sick forthe
length ofoneminute.
James Taggart spoke first. Hisvoice was low, but ithad the
trembling intensity ofaninvoluntary scream: '‘Well, whynot?Why
should theyhave it,ifwedon’t?Why should they stand above us?
Ifwearetoperish, let’smake sure thatweallperish together. Let’s
make sure thatweleave themnochance tosurvive!”
“That’s adamn funny thing tosayabout avery practical plan that
willbenefit everybody,” saidOrren Boyle shrilly, looking atTaggart
infrightened astonishment.
Dr.Ferris chuckled.
Taggart’s eyesseemed tofocus, andhesaid, hisvoice louder, “Yes,
ofcourse. It’savery practical plan. It’snecessary, practical and just.
Itwillsolve everybody's problems. Itwillgiveeverybody achance
tofeel safe.Achance torest.”
“Itwillgive security tothepeople,” saidEugene Lawson, his
mouth slithering into asmile. “Security—that’s what thepeople
want. Iftheywant it,why shouldn’t theyhave it?Justbecause a
handful ofrich willobject?”
“It’s nottherichwho’ll object,” said Dr.Ferris lazily. “The rich
drool forsecurity more thananyother sortofanimal—haven't you
discovered thatyet?”
“Well, who’ll object?” snapped Lawson.
Dr.Ferris smiled pointedly, anddidnotanswer.
Lawson looked away.“To hellwiththem!Why should weworry
about them ?We’ve gottoruntheworld forthesake ofthe little
people. It’sintelligence that’s caused allthetroubles ofhumanity.
Man’s mind istherootofallevil.This isthedayofthoheart. It’s

“Shut up!”screamed James Taggart.
They allstared athim.“For Christ’s sake, Jim,what’s thematter?'*
saidOrren Boyle, shaking.
“Nothing,” saidTaggart, “nothing . . .Wesley, keephim still,
willyou?”
Mouch saiduncomfortably, “But Ifailtosee—”
“Just keephim still.Wedon’t have tolisten tohim,dowe?”
“Why, no,but—”
“Then let’sgoon.”
“What isthis?” demanded Lawson. “1resent itImost emphati-
cally—”Buthesawnosupport inthefacesaround himandstopped,
hismouth sagging intoanexpression ofpouting hatred.
“Let's goon,” saidTaggart feverishly.
“What's thematter withyou?” asked Orren Boyle, trying notto
know whatwasthematter with himself andwhyhefeltfrightened.
“Genius isasuperstition, Jim,” saidDr.Ferris slowly, withanodd
kind ofemphasis, asifknowing thathewasnaming theunnamed in
alltheir minds. “There’s nosuch thing astheintellect Aman's brain
isasocial product. Asum ofinfluences that he’spicked upfrom

**/\rewehere totalkbusiness orarewehere tokidoneanother?”
asked Fred Kinnnn.

hut hisfacehadtheastonishing property offinely drawn lines that
raised thecorners ofhismouth into thepermanent hintofawise,
sardonic grinHesatonthearmofthechair, hands inpockets,
looking atMouch with thesmiling glance ofahardened policeman
atashoplifter.
“All I’vegottosay isthatyou'd better staff thatUnification Board
withmymen,” hesaid “Better make sureofit,brother—orI'llblast
your PointOne tohell.”
“1intend, ofcourse, tohave arepresentative oflabor onthat
Board,” saidMouch dryly, “aswell asarepresentative ofindustry,
oftheprofessions andofevery cross-section of--"
“No cross-sections,” saidFred Kinnau evenly. “Just representa-
tives oflabor. Period.”
“What thehell!” yelled Orren Boyle. “That’s stacking thecards,
isn't it*”
“Sute,” saidFred Kinnan.
“But that willgiveyouastranglehold onevery business inthe
country!”
“What doyouthink I'mafter?”
“That’s unfair!” yelled Boyle. “Iwon't stand for it!Youhaveno
right!*You—”
“Right?” saidKinnan innocently. “Arewetalking about rights?”
499
“But, Imean, after all,there arecertain fundamental property
rights which—”
"‘Listen, pal,youwant Point Three, don’t you?”
“Well, I—”
“Then you’d better keepyour trapshutabout property rights from
now on.Keep itshut tight.”
“Mr. Kinnan,” said Dr. Ferris, “you must notmake theold-
fashioned mistake ofdrawing wide generalizations. Our policy has
tobeflexible. There arenoabsolute principles which—”
“Save itforJimTaggart, Doc,” saidFred Kinnan. “Iknow what
I’mtalking about. That’s because 1never went tocollege.”
‘iobject,” saidBoyle, “toyour dictatorial method of—”
Kinnan turned hisbackonhimand said, “Listen, Wesley, myboys
won’t likePoint One. IfIgettorunthings. I’llmake them swallow
it.Ifnot, not.Justmake upyourmind.”
"Well—”saidMouch. andstopped.
“For Christ's sake, Wesley, what about us?” yelled Taggart.
“You'll come tome,” saidKinnan, “when you’ll need adeal to
fixtheBoard. But I’llrunthatBoard. MeandWesley.”
“Doyouthink thecountry willstand forit?”yelled Taggart.
“Stop kidding yourself,” said Kinnan. “The country? Ifthere
aren't anyprinciples anymore—and 1guess thedoc isright, because
there sure aren’t ifthere aren’t anyrules tothisgame and it'sonly
aquestion ofwho robswhom—then I'vegotmore votes than the
bunch ofyou, there aremore workers than employers, anddon’t
youforget it,boys!”
“That's afunny altitude totake.” saidTaggart haughtily, “about
ameasure which, after all, isnotdesigned fortheselfish benefit of
workers oremployers, butforthegeneral welfare ofthepublic.”
“Okay,” saidKinnan amiably, “let’s talkyour lingo.Who isthe

Hestood up.Nooneanswered him.He lethiseyesmove slowly
from face tofaceandstoponWesley Mouch.
“Do IgettheBoard, Wesley?” heasked casually.
“The selection ofthespecific personnel isonly atechnical detail,”
saidMouch pleasantly, “Suppose wediscuss itlater, youandI?”
Everybody intheroomknew that thismeant theanswer Yes.
“Okay, pal,” saidKinnan. Hewent back tothewindow, satdown
onthe sillandlighted acigarette.
Forsome unadmitted reason, theothers were looking atDr.Ferns,
asifseeking guidance.
“Don’t bedisturbed byoratory.” saidDr.Ferris smoothly. “Mr.
Kinnan isafinespeaker, buthehasnosense ofpractical reality. He
isunable tothink dialectically.”
There wasanother silence, thenJames Taggart spoke upsuddenly.
“Idon’t care. Itdoesn't matter. He’llhave tohold things still.Every-
thing willhave toremain asitis.Just asitis.Nobody willbepermit-
tedtochange anything. Except—”Heturned sharply toWesley
Mouch. “Wesley, under Point Four, we’llhave toclose allresearch
departments, experimental laboratories, scientific foundations and all
therestoftheinstitutions ofthatkind. They'll have tobeforbidden.”
“Yes, that’s right,” saidMouch. ihadn’t thought ofthat. We’ll
have tostickmacouple offinesabout that”Hehunted around for
apencil andmade afewscrawls onthemargin ofhispaper.
“Itwillendwasteful competition,” saidJames Taggart. “We'll stop
scrambling tobeatoneanother totheuntried andtheunknown. We
won’t have toworry about newinventions upsetting themarket. We
won'! have topourmoney down thedrain inuseless experiments
lusttokeepupwithoverambitious competitors.”
“Yes,” saidOrren Boyle. “Nobody should beallowed towaste
money onthenew untileverybody hasplenty oftheold.Close all
Ihosedamn research laboratories —andthesooner, thebetter.”
“Yes,” saidWesley Mouch. “We'll close them.AUofthem,”
“The State Science Institute, loo?” asked Fred Kinnan.
“Oh, no!” saidMouch. “Thai’s different That’s government. Be-
sides, it'sanon-profit institution. And itwillbesufficient totake
careofallscientific progress.”
“Quite sufficient,” saidDr. Ferris,
“And what willbecome ofalltheengineers, professors andsuch,
when youclose allthose laboratories?” asked Fred Kinnan. “What
aretheygoing todoforaliving, with alltheother jobsandbusi-
nesses frozen?”
“Oh,” saidWesley Mouch. Hescratched hishead.Heturned to
MrWeatherby. “Doweputthemonrelief, Clem?”
“No,” saidMr.Weatherby. “What for?There's notenough of
them toraise asquawk. Notenough tomatter.'’
“1suppose,” saidMouch, turning toDr. Ferris, “that you’ll be
able toabsorb some ofthem, Floyd?”
“Some,” saidDr.Ferris slowly, asifrelishing every syllable ofhis
answer. “Those whoprove co-operative.”
‘What about therest?” saidFred Kinnan.
501
“They'll have towait tilltheUnification Board findssome usefor
them," saidWesley Mouch.
“What willthey eatwhile they're waiting?"
Mouch shrugged. “There's gottobesome victims intimes ofna-
tional emergency. Itcan't behelped."
“Wehave theright todoit!"cried Taggart suddenly, indefiance
tothestillness oftheroom."Weneed it.Weneed it,don't we?"
There wasnoanswer. “Wehave theright toprotect ourlivelihood!"
Nobody opposed him, buthewentonwith ashrill, pleading, insis-
tence. "We'll besafe forthe firsttime incenturies. Everybody will
know hisplace andjob,andeverybody elsc’s place andjob—andwe
won’t beatthemercy ofevery stray crank with anew idea.Nobody

mitted todecide anything. Itwillbedecided onceand forall."His
glance moved pleadingly from face toface. “There's beenenough
invented already—enough foreverybody's comfort—why should
theybeallowed togooninventing? Why should wepermit them to
blast theground from under ourfeetevery fewsteps?Why should

window, butlooked hastily away: hedidnotwant toseethewhite
obelisk inthe.distance. “We’re through withthem. We've won. This
isourage.Our world. We're going tohave security—forthe first
time incenturies—forthe firstlime since thebeginning oftheindus-
trial revolution1"
“Well, this, Iguess," saidFred Kinnan, “istheanti-industrial
revolution."
“That’s adamn funny thing foryou tosay!" snapped Wesley
Mouth. “We can't bepermitted tosaythat tothepublic."
"Don’t worry, brother. Iwon’t say ittothepublic."
“It?satotal fallacy," saidDr.Ferris. “It’s astatement prompted
byignorance. Every expert hasconceded longagothat aplanned
economy achieves themaximum ofproductive efficiency and that
centralization leads tosuper-industrialization."*
“Centralization destroys theblight ofmonopoly," saidBoyle.
“How’s thatagain?" drawled Kinnan.
Boyle didnotcatch thetone ofmockery, andanswered Earnestly,
“Itdestroys theblight ofmonopoly. Itleads tothedemocratization
ofindustry. Itmakes everything available toeverybody. How, for

instance, atatime likethis,when there’s such adesperate shortage of
iron ore, isthere anysense inmywasting money, labor andnational
resources onmaking old-fashioned steel,when there exists amuch
better metal that Icould bemaking? Ametal thateverybody wants,
butnobody can get.Now isthatgood economics orsound social
efficiency ordemocratic justice? Why shouldn’t fbeallowed toman-
ufacture thatmetal andwhyshouldn't thepeople get itwhen they
need it?Justbecause oftheprivate monopoly ofone selfish individ-
ual?Should wesacrifice ourrights tohispersonal interests?”
‘Skip it,brother,” saidFred Kinnan. “Fve read itallinthesame
newspapers youdid.”
“Idon't likeyour altitude.'' saidBoyle, inasudden toneofrigh-
teousness, with alook which, inabarroom, would have signified a
prelude toafistfight.Hesatupstraight, buttressed bythecolumns
otparagraphs onyellow tinged paper, which hewasseeing inhis
mind:
“At atime ofcrucial public need, arewetowaste social
effort onthemanufacture ofobsolete products? Arewe
toletthemany remain inwant while thefewwithhold
from usthebetter products andmethods available? Are
wetobestopped bythesuperstition ofpatent rights?”
“Is itnotobvious thatprivate industry isunable tocope
with thepresent economic crisis?How long, forinstance,
arewegoing toputupwith thedisgraceful shortage of
Reardon Metal? Thetc isacrying public demand for it,
which Reardon hasfailed tosupply."’
“When arewegoing toputanendtoeconomic injustice
and special privileges? Why should Rearden betheonly
onepermitted tomanufacture Rearden Metal?”
“1don’t likeyour attitude,” saidOrren Boyle “Solong aswe
icspect therights oftheworkers, we'llwantyoutorespect therights
oftheindustrialists.”
“Which rights ofwhich industrialists?” drawled Kinnan.
“I'm inclined tothink,” saidDr.Ferris hastily, “that PointTwo,
perhaps, isthemost essential oneofallatpresent. Wemust putan
endtothatpeculiar business ofindustrialists retiring andvanishing.
Wemust stopthem. It’splaying havoc withourentire economy”
“Why aretheydoing it?”asked Taggart nervously. “Where are
they allgoing?”
“Nobody knows,” saidDr.Ferris. “We've been unable tofindany
information orexplanation. But itmustbestopped. Intimes ofcrisis,
economic service tothenation isjustasmuch ofaduty asmilitary
service. Anyone whoabandons itshould beregarded asadeserter.
Ihaverecommended thatweintroduce thedeath penalty forthose
men, butWesley wouldn’t agree toit”
“Take iteasy, boy,” saidFredKinnan inanodd.slow voice.He
satsuddenly andperfectly still, hisarms crossed, looking atFerris
inamanner thatmade itsuddenly real totheroom thatFerris had
503
proposed murder. “Don't letmehearyou talkabout anydeath pen-
alties inindustry."
Dr.Ferris shrugged.
“We don’t have togotoextremes,” saidMouoh hastily. ‘‘We don't
want tofrighten people Wewant tohavethem onour side.Our
topproblem is.willthey . . .willthey accept itatall?”
“They will,” saidDr.Ferris.
‘Tm alittle worried," saidEugene Lawson, “about Points Three
andFour. Faking over thepatents isline.Nobody’s going todefend
industrialists. ButI'mworried about taking over thecopyrights.
That’s going toantagonize theintellectuals. It’sdangerous. It’sa
spiritual issue. Doesn't Point Fourmean thatnonewbooks areto
bewritten orpublished fromnowon?”
“Yes,” saidMouch, “itdoes. Butwecan’tmake anexception for
thebook-publishing business. Itsanindustry likeanyother.When
wesay‘nonew products,’ it'sgottomean nonew products.'”
“But this isamatter otthespirit,” saidLawson; hisvoice hada
tone, notofrational respect, butofsuperstitious awe.
“We’re notinterfering withanybody’s spirit. Butwhen you print
abookonpaper, itbecomes amaterial commodity— and ifwegrant
anexception toonecommodity, wewon't beable tohold theothers
inlineandwewon't beable tomake anything stick.”
“Yes. that’s ttue. But—”
“Don’t beachump. Gene," saidDj.Ferris. “You don't wantsome

“Yes, but .. .but ldon’t think thewriters will like it.”
“Are you*sure?” asked Wesley Mouch. with aglance thatwas
almost asmile. “Don’t forget thatunder Point Five, thepublishers
willhave topublish asmany books asthey did intheBasic Yeai.
Since there willbenonewones, they willhave toreprint andthe

“Oh,” saidLawson; heremembered thathehadseenMouch

“For once,” said Dr.Ferris, “1agree withMr.Kinnan. 1agree

“Yes,” saidMouch. “Iknow/’
“The danger that I'mworried about willcome from adifferent
quaiter.” saidDrFerris thoughtfully. “You might runintoquite a
bitoftrouble onthat‘voluntary Gift Certificate’ business, Wesley.”
“Iknow,” saidMouch glumly. "That’s thepoint Iwanted Thomp-
sontohelp usouton.But Iguess hecan’t.Wedon't actually have

stopped.
James Taggart leaned back inhischair, watching them; hewas
beginning toenjoy theconversation.
“Yes,'’ saidDr,Ferris, “I’m thinking ofit,too.I’mthinking ofa
certain tycoon who isinaposition toblast ustopieces. Whether
we’ll recover thepieces ornot, ishard totell.Godknows what is

things which must notbesaid—andheisnotafraid tosaythem.
Heknows theonedangerous, fatally dangerous weapon. He isour
deadliest adversary.’’
“Who?” asked Lawson.
Dr.Ferris hesitated, shrugged andanswered, “The guiltless man.”
Lawson stared blankly. “What doyoumean andwhom areyou
talking about?”
James Taggart smiled.
“Imean thatthere isnoway todisarm anyman,” saidDr.Ferris,
“except through guilt.Through thatwhich hehimself hasaccepted
asguilt. Ifaman hasever stolen adime, youcanimpose onhim
thepunishment intended forabank robber andhewilltake it.He’ll

won’t defend himself. Hewon't feel he’sworth it.Hewon’t fight.
Butsave usfrom themanwho livesuptohisown standards. Save
usfrom theman ofclean conscience. He’s theman who’ll beat us.”
“Areyoutalking about Henry Rearden?” asked Taggart, hisvoice
peculiarly clear.
Theonename theyhadnotwanted topronounce struck them into
aninstant’s silence.
“What ifIwere?” asked Dr.Ferris cautiously.
^Oh, nothing,” saidTaggart. “Only, ifyouwere, 1would tellyou
that Icandeliver Henry Rearden. He’ll sign.”
Bytherules oftheirunspoken language, they allknew—from the
tone ofhisvoice—thathewasnotbluffing.
“God, Jim!No!” gasped Wesley Mouch.
“Yes,” saidTaggart. “Iwasstunned, too,when Ilearned—what
Ilearned. Ididn't expect that.Anything butthat.”
“Iamglad tohear it,”saidMouch cautiously. “It’s aconstructive
piece ofinformation. Itmight bevery valuable indeed.”
t
“Valuable—yes,” saidTaggart pleasantly. “When doyokiplan to
putthedirective intoeffect?”
“Oh,wehave tomove fast.Wedon't wantanynews orit toleak
out. Iexpect you alltokeep thismost strictly confidential. I’dsay
that we’llbeready tospring itonthem inacouple ofw^eks.”
“Don’t youthink itwould be—advisable—before allprices are

frozen—toadjust thematter oftherailroad rates? Iwasthinking of
araise.Asmall butmost essentially needed raise.”
“We’ll discuss it,youand l,”saidMouch amiably. “Itmight be
arranged.” Heturned totheothers; Boyle’s facewassagging. “There
aremany details stilltobeworked out,butI’msure thatourpro-
gram won’t encounter anymajor difficulties.’Hewasassuming the
toneandmanner ofapublic address; hesounded briskandalmost
cheerful. “Rough spots aretobeexpected. Ifonething doesn’t work,

“Say,” asked Kinnan. “how istheemergency toend ifeverything

“Don’t betheoretical,” saidMouch impatiently. “We've gotto

FredKinnan chuckled. “Who isJohn Galt?”
“Don’t saythat!” cried Taggart.
“1have aquestion toaskabout Point Seven,” saidKinnan. “It
says that allwages, prices, salaries, dividends, profits andsoforth
willbefrozen onthedate ofthedirective. Taxes, too?”
“Ohno!” criedMouch. “How canwctellwhat fundswe llneed in
thefuture?” Kinnan seemed tobesmiling. “Well?” snapped Mouch.
“What about it?”
“Nothing,” saidKinnan. “Ijustasked.”
Mouch leaned back inhischair. “Imust saytoallofyouthat I
appreciate yourcoming hereandgiving usthebenefit ofyour opin-
ions. Ithasbeen very helpful.” Heleaned forward tolook athis
deskcalendar and satover itforamoment, toying with hispencil.
1henthepencil came down, struck adateanddrew acircle around
it“Directive 10-289 willgointo effect onthemorning ofMay first.”
Allnodded approval. None looked athisneighbor.
James Taggart rose,walked tothewindow andpulled theblind
down over thewhite obelisk,
*
Inthe firstmoment ofawakening. Dagny wasastonished tofind
herself looking atthespires ofunfamiliar buildings against aglowing,
paleblue sky.Then shesawthetwisted scam ofthethinstocking
onherown leg,she feltawrench ofdiscomfort inthemuscles of
herwaistline, andsherealized thatshewas lyingonthecouch in
heroffice, with theclock onherdesk saying 6:15andthe firstrays
ofthesungiving silver edges tothesilhouettes oftheskyscrapers
beyond thewindow. The lastthing sheremembered wasthatshe
haddropped down onthecouch, intending torestfortenminutes,
when thewindow wasblack andtheclock stood at3:30.
Shetwisted herself toherfeet, feeling anenormous exhaustion.
1helighted lamponthedesklooked futile intheglow ofthemorn-
ing,overthepilesofpaper which were hercheerless, unfinished task.
507
She tried nottothink ofthework forafewminutes longer, while
shedragged herself pastthedesk toherwashroom and lethandfuls
ofcoldwater runover herface.
Theexhaustion wasgonebythetimeshestepped back intothe
office.Nomatter what night preceded it,shehadnever known a
morning when shedidnot fecitheriseofaquiet excitement that
became atightening energy inherbody andahunger foraction in
hermind—because thiswasthebeginning ofdayand itwasaday
ofher life.Shelooked down atthecity.The streets were stillempty,
itmade them look wider, and intheluminous cleanliness ofthe
spring airtheyseemed tobewaiting forthepromise ofallthegreat*
ness thatwould takeform intheactivity about topour through
them.Thecalendar mthedistance said:May 1.
She satdown atherdesk, smiling indefiance atthedistastefulness
ofherjob.Shehated thereports thatshehadtofinish reading, but
itwasherjob, itwasherrailroad, itwasmorning. She lighted a
cigarette, thinking thatshewould finish thistaskbefore breakfast;
sheturned offthelampandpulled thepapers forward.
There were reports from thegeneral managers ofthetourRegions
oftheTaggart system, their pages atypewritten cryofdespair over
thebreakdowns ofequipment. There wasareport about awreck on
themain linenear Winston, Colorado. There wasthenewbudget
oftheOperating Department, therevised budget based ontheraise
inrateswhich Jimhadobtained lastweek. She tried tochoke the
exasperation ofhopelessness asshewent slowly over thebudget's
figures; allthose calculations hadbeenmade ontheassumption that
thevolume offreight would remain unchanged and that theraise
would bring them added revenue bytheendoftheyear; sheknew
thatthefreight tonnage would goonshrinking, thattheraisewould
make little difference, thatbytheendofthisyear their losses would
begreater than ever.
When shelooked upfrom thepages, shesawwith asmall joltof
astonishment thattheclock said 9:25.Shehadbeen dimly aware of
theusual sound ofmovement andvoices intheanteroom ofher
office, asherstaffhadarrived tobegin their day;shewondered why
nobody hadentered heroffice andwhyhertelephone hadremained
silent; asadaily rule, there should havebeen arushofbusiness by
thishour. Sheglanced athercalendar; there was anote that the
McNeil CarFoundry ofChicago was tophone her atnineam in
regard tothenew freight carswhich Taggart Transcontinental had
been expecting forsixmonths.
Sheflicked theswitch oftheinteroffice communicator focallher
secretary. The girl's voice answered with astartled little glisp: “Miss
Taggart! Areyouhere, inyour office?”s
“fslept here lastnight, again. Didn’t intend to,butdid.fWas there
acallformefrom theMcNeil CarFoundry?”
“No, Miss Taggart.”
“Putthem through tomeimmediately, when they call.
“Yes, MissTaggart.”
Switching thecommunicator off,shewondered whethef sheimag-
508
incd itorwhether there hadbeen something strange inthe girl’s
voice: ithadsounded unnaturally tense.
She feltthefaint light-headedness ofhunger andthought thatshe
should godown togetacupofcoffee, butthere was stillthereport
ofthechief engineer tofinish, soshelighted onemore cigarette,
.Thechief engineer wasoutontheroad, supervising thereconstruc-
tionofthemain track with theRearden Metal railtaken from the
corpse attheJohn Galt Line; shehadchosen thesections most
urgently inneed ofrepair. Opening hisreport, sheread—with a
shock ofincredulous anger—thathehadstopped woTk inthemoun-
tainsection ofWinston, Colorado. Herecommended achange of
plans: hesuggested thatthe railintended forWinston beused, in-
stead, torepair thetrack oftheirWashington-to-Miami branch. He
gave hisreasons: aderailment hadoccurred onthatbranch lastweek,
andMr.Tmky Holloway ofWashington, Iraveling with aparty of
friends, hadbeen delayed forthree hours; ithadbeen reported tothe
chief engineer thatMr.Holloway hadexpressed extreme displeasure.
Although, from apurely technological viewpoint- -.said thechief en-
gineer’s report—therailoftheMiami branch was inbetter condition
than that oftheWinston section, onehad toremember, from a
sociological viewpoint, thattheMiami branch earned amuch more
important class ofpassenger traffic; therefore, thechief engineer sug-
gested thatWinston could bekept waiting alittle longer, andrecom-
mended thesacrifice ofanobscure section ofmountain trackage for
thesake ofabranch where "Taggart Transcontinental could not
afford tocicate anunfavorable impression.”
She read, slashing lutious pencil marks onthemargins ofthe
pages, thinking thather firstduty oftheday,ahead ofanyother,
was toslop thisparticular piece ofinsanity
Thetelephone rang.
"Yes?” sheasked, snatching thereceiver. “McNeil CarFoundry?”
“No," saidthevoice ofhersecretary. “Seilor Francisco dAnconia.”
Shelooked atthephone’s mouthpiece fortheinstant otabrief
shock, “All right. Puthimon”
'Thenext voice sheheard wasFrancisco’s. “Jseethatyou're in
your office justthesame," hesaid; hisvoice wasmocking, harsh
andtense.
“Where didyouexpect metobe?”
“How doyou likethenewsuspension?”
“What suspension?”
“The moratorium onbrains.”
“What aieyoutalking about?"
“Haven’t youseen today’s newspapers?”
“No.”
Iherewasapause; then hisvoicecame slowly, changed andgrave:
"better take alook atthem, Dagny.”
."All right.”
‘i’ll callyou later.”
Shehungupandpressed theswitch ofthecommunicator onher
desk.“Getmeanewspaper,” shesaid tohersecretary'
509
uYes,MissTaggart/1thesecretary's voice answered grimly.
ItwasEddie Willers whocame inandputthenewspaper down
onherdesk.Themeaning ofthelookonhisfacewasthesame as
thetone shehadcaught inFrancisco’s voice: theadvance notice of
some inconceivable disaster.
“None ofuswanted tobefirsttotellyou/’ hesaidvery quietly
andwalked out.
When sherosefrom herdesk, afewmoments later, she feltthat
shehad fullcontrol ofherbody andthatshewasnotaware ofher
body’s existence. She feltlifted toherfeetand itseemed toherthat
shestood straight, nottouching theground. There wasanabnormal
clarity about every object intheroom: yetshewasseeing nothing
around her,butsheknew thatshewould beable toseethethread
ofacobweb ifherpurpose required it,justasshewould beable to
walk with asomnambulist’s assurance along theedge ofaroof.She
could notknow thatshewaslooking attheroom with theeyes of
aperson whohad lostthecapacity andtheconcept ofdoubt, and
what remained toherwasthesimplicity ofasingle perception and
ofasingle goal.Shedidnotknow that thething which seemed so
violent, yetfeltlikesuch astill,unfamiliar calm within her,wasthe
power offullcertainty—and thattheanger shaking herbody, the
anger which made herready, with thesame passionate indifference,
either tokillortodie,washerlove ofrectitude, theonly love to
which alltheyears ofher lifehadbeen given.
Holding thenewspaper inherhand, shewalked outofheroffice
andontoward the hall.Sheknew, crossing theanteroom, thatthe
faces ofherstaffwere turned toher,buttheyseemed tobemany
years away.
Shewalked down thehall,moving swiftly butwithout effort, with
thesame sensation ofknowing thatherfeetwere probably touching
theground butthatshedidnotfeel it.Shedidnotknowhowmany
rooms shecrossed toreach Jim’s office, orwhether there hadbeen
anypeople inherway, sheknew thedirection totakeandthedoor
topullopen toenter unannounced andwalk toward hisdesk.
Thenewspaper wastwisted intoarollbythetimeshestood before
him.Shethrew itathisface, itstruck hischeek and felldown to
thecarpet.
“There’s myresignation, Jim,” she said. "Iwon’t work asaslave
orasaslave-driver.”
Shedidnothearthesound ofhisgasp; itcame with thesound of
thedoordosing after her.
Shewent back toheroffice and, crossing theanteroom, signaled
Eddie tofollow herinside.
Shesaid, hervoice calmand clear, “Ihave resigned.”
Henodded silently,
“1don’tknow asyetjvhat I’lldointhefuture. I’mgoing away,
tothink itoverandtodedde. Ifyouwant tofollow me,| I’llbeat
thelodge inWoodstock.” Itwasanoldhunting cabin inaforest of
theBerkshire Mountains, which shehadinherited from herfather
andhadnotvisited foryears.
510
“Iwant tofollow/’ hewhispered, “Iwant toquit,and ...and 1
can’t. Ican’tmake myself doit.”
“Then willyoudomeafavor?”
“Ofcourse.”
“Don’t communicate withmeabout therailroad. 1don’t want to
hear it.Don’t tellanyone where lam,except Hank Rcarden. Ifhe
asks, tellhimabout thecabin andhow togetthere. Butnoone else,
1don’t want toseeanybody.”
“All right.”
“Promise?”
“Ofcourse.”
“When Idecide what’s tobecome ofme. I’llletyouknow.”
“Pll wait.”
“That’s allEddie.”
Heknew thatevery word wasmeasured and thatnothing else
could besaidbetween them atthismoment. Heinclined hishead,
letting itsaytherest,thenwalked outoftheoffice.
Shesawthechief engineer’s report stilllyingopen onherdesk,
andthought thatshehadtoorder him atonce toresume workon
theWinston section, thenremembered that itwasnotherproblem
anylonger. She feltnopain. Sheknew that thepainwould come
laterand that itwould beatearing agony ofpain, and thatthe
numbness ofthismoment wasarestgranted toher,notafter, but
before, tomake herready tobear it.But itdidnotmatter. Ifthat
isrequired ofme,then I'llbear it—shethought.
She satdown atherdeskandtelephoned Rearden athismills
inPennsylvania.
“Hello, dearest,” hesaid.Hesaid itsimply and clearly, asifhe
wanted tosay itbecause itwas realand right, andheneeded to
holdontotheconcepts ofreality andrightness.
“Hank. I’vequit.”
“Isee.”Hesounded asifhehadexpected it.
“Nobody came togetme,nodestroyer, perhaps there never was

“No. 1havetwoweeks inwhich theyexpect metosign their Gift

“Doyouneedme—forthetwoweeks?”

“Yes,mydarling. Solong.”
Itwasweightlessly easy towalk outofheroffice anddown the
stretching halls ofTaggart Transcontinental. Shewalked, looking
ahead, hersteps advancing with theunbroken, unhurried rhythm of
finality. Herfacewasheld leveland ithadalook ofastonishment,
ofacceptance, ofrepose.
Shewalked across theconcourse oftheTerminal. Shesawthe
statue ofNathaniel Taggart. Butshe feltnopainfrom itandno
reproach, only therising fullness ofherlove, only thefeeling that
shewasgoing tojoinhim, notindeath, butinthatwhich hadbeen
his life.
* *
The firstman toquit atRearden SteelwasTom Colby, rolling
millforeman, head oftheRearden Steel Workers Union. Forten
years, hehadheard himself denounced throughout thecountry, be-
cause hiswasa“company union” andbecause hehadnever engaged
inaviolent conflict with themanagement. TTiiswas true:noconflict
hadeverbeen necessary; Rearden paid ahigher wage scale thanany
union scale inthecountry, forwhich hedemanded—andgot—the
bestlabor force tobefound anywhere.
WhenTomColby toldhimthathewasquitting. Rearden nodded,
without comment orquestions.
“Iwon’t work under these conditions, myself,” Colby added qui-
etly,“and lwon’t help tokeep themenworking. They trustme. I
won’t betheJudas goat leading them tothestockyards.”
“What areyougoing todoforaliving?” asked Rearden.
“I’ve saved enough tolastmeforabout ayear.”
“And after that?”
Colby shrugged.
Rearden thought oftheboywith theangry eyes,whomined coal
atnight asacriminal. Hethought ofallthedark roads, thealleys,
theback yards ofthecountry, where thebestofthecountry’s men
would nowexchange their services injungle barter, inchance jobs,
inunrecorded transactions. Hethought oftheendofthatroad.
Tom Colby seemed toknow what hewasthinking. “You’re on
yourway toendupright alongside ofme,MrRearden^’ hesaid.
“Are yougoing tosignyour brains over tothem?”
“No.”
“And after that?”
Rearden shrugged.
Colby’s eyeswatched him foramoment, pale, shrewdi eyes ina
furnace-tanned facewithsoot-engraved wrinkles. “They’vi been tell-
512
ingusforyears that it’syouagainst me,Mr.Rearden. But itisn't.
It’sOrren Boyle andFredKinnan against youandme.”
“Iknow it.”
TheWetNurse hadnever entered Rearden’s office, asifsensing
thatthatwasaplace hehadnoright toenter.Healways waited to
catch aglimpse ofRearden outside. The directive hadattached him
tohisjob,asthemills* official watchdog ofover-or-underproduction.
Hestopped Rearden, afewdays later, inanalleybetween therows
ofopen-hearth furnaces. There wasanoddlook offierceness onthe
boy’s face.
“Mr.Rearden,” hesaid, “Iwanted totellyouthat ifyouwant to
pour tentimes thequota ofRearden Metal orsteel orpigironor
anything, andbootleg itallover theplace toanybody atanyprice—
Iwanted totel!youtogoahead. I’llfix itup. I’lljuggle thebooks.
I’llfake thereports. I’llgetphony witnesses. I’llforge affidavits. I’ll
commit peijury—soyoudon’t have toworry, there won’t beany
trouble!”
“Now whydoyouwant todothat?” asked Rearden, smiling, but
hissmile vanished when heheard theboyanswer earnestly:
“Because 1want, foronce, todosomething moral.”
“That’s nottheway tobemoral—”Rearden started, andstopped
abruptly, realizing that itwastheway, theonlyway left, realizing
through howmany twists ofintellectual corruption upon corruption
thisboyhadtostruggle toward hismomentous discovery.
“Iguess that’s nottheword,” theboy said sheepishly. “1know
it’sastuffy, old-fashioned word: That's notwhat Imeant. Imeant—”
Itwasasudden, desperate cryofincredulous anger: “Mr. Rearden,
theyhavenoright todoit!”
“What?”
“Take Rearden Meta! away from you.”
Rearden smiled and,prompted byadesperate pity, said,“Forget
it,Non-Absolute. There arenorights.”
“Iknow there aren’t. But Imean . .what 1mean isthatthey
can’tdoit.”
“Why not?” Hecould nothelp smiling.
“Mr. Rearden, don’t sign theGift Certificate! Don’t sign it,on
principle.”
“Iwon’t sign it.Butthere aren't anyprinciples.”
“1know there aren’t.” Hewas reciting itinfullearnestness, with
thehonesty ofaconscientious student: “Iknow thateverything is
relative and thatnobody canknow anything and thatreason isan
illusion and thatthere isn’tany reality. ButI’m justtalking about
Rearden Metal. Don’t sign,Mr.Rearden. Morals ornomorals, prin-
ciples ornoprinciples, justdon’t sign it—because itisn’t right!”
Noone elsementioned thedirective inRearden's presence. Si-
lencewasthenewaspect about themills.Themendidnotspeak to
himwhen heappeared intheworkshops, andhenoticed thatthey
didnotspeak tooneanother, lirepersonnel office received nofor-
malresignations. Butevery other morning, oneortwomen failed
toappear andnever appeared again. Inquiries attheirhomes found
thehomes abandoned andthemengone.Thepersonnel office did
513
notreport these desertions, asthedirective required; instead. Rear-
denbegan toseeunfamiliar facesamong theworkers, thedrawn,
beaten faces ofthelong-unemployed, andheard them addressed by
thenames ofthemenwhohad quit.Heasked noquestions.
There wassilence throughout thecountry. Hedidnotknowhow
many industrialists hadretired andvanished onMay land 2,leaving
their plants tobeseized. Hecounted tenamong hisowncustomers,
including McNeil oftheMcNeil CarFoundry inChicago. Hehadno
wayoflearning about theothers; noreports appeared inthenewspa-
pers.Thefront pages ofthenewspapers were suddenly fullofstones
about spnng floods, traffic accidents, school picnics andgolden-
wedding anniversaries.
There was silence inhisownhome. Lillian haddeparted ona
vacation triptoFlorida, inmid-April; ithadastonished him, asan
inexplicable whim; itwas the fiTst tripshehadtaken alone since
their marriage. Philip avoided him, with alook ofpanic. Hismother
stared atRearden inreproachful bewilderment; shesaidnothing, but
shekept bursting into tears inhispresence, hermanner suggesting
thathertearswere themost impoitant aspect toconsider inwhatever
disaster itwasthatshesensed approaching.
Oftthemorning ofMay 15,hesatatthedesk inhisoffice, above
thespread ofthemills, andwatched thecolors ofthesmoke rising
totheclear, blue sky.Inhere were spurts oftransparent smoke, like
waves ofheat, invisible butforthestructures thatshivered behind
them; there were streaks ofredsmoke, and sluggish columns of
yellow, and light, floating spirals ofblue—andthethick, tight, swiftly
pouring coils thatlooked liketwisted bolts ofsatin tinged amother-

Thebuzzer rangonhisdesk,andMiss Ives’ voice said,“Dr.Floyd
Ferris toseeyou, without appointment, Mr.Rearden.” Jnspite of
itsrigid formality, hertoneconveyed thequestion- Shall Ithrow
himout?
There wasafaintmovement ofastonishment inReardeiTs face,
barely above thelineofindifference; hehadnotexpected thatpartic-
ularemissary. Heanswered evenly, “Ask him tocome in.”
Dr.Ferris didnotsmile ashewalked toward Rearden’s desk; he
merely wore alook suggesting thatRearden knew fullwell thathe
hadgood reason tosmile andsohewould abstain from theobvious.
Hesatdown infront ofthedesk, notwaiting foraninvitation; he
carried abriefcase, which heplaced across hisknees; heacted asif
words were superfluous, since hisreappearance inthis office had
made everything clear.
Rearden satwatching him inpatient silence.
“Since thedeadline forthesigning ofthenational Gift Certificates
expires tonight atmidnight,” saidDr.Ferris, inthetoneofasales-
man extending aspecial courtesy toacustomer, “Ihavecome to
obtain your signature, Mr.Rearden.”;
Hepaused, withanairofsuggesting thattheformula no?w called
forananswer.
“Goon,” saidRearden. “Iamlistening.”%
“Yes, Isuppose Ishould explain,” saidDr.Ferris, “that^we wish
514
togetyour signature early intheday inorder toannounce thefact
onanational news broadcast. Although the giftprogram hasgone
through quite smoothly, there are stillafewstubborn individualists
left,whohave failed tosign—small fry,really, whose patents arcof
nocrucial value, butwecannot letthem remain unbound; asamatter
ofprinciple, youunderstand. They are,webelieve, waiting tofollow
your lead.Youhave agreat popular following, Mr.Rearden, much
greater thanyoususpected orknewhow touse.Therefore, thean-
nouncement thatyouhave signed willremove thelasthopes ofresis-
tance and, bymidnight, willbring inthe last signatures, thus
completing theprogram onschedule.”
Rearden knew thatofallpossible speeches, thiswasthe lastDr.
Ferris would make ifanydoubt ofhissurrender remained inthe
man's mind.
“Go on,” saidRearden evenly. “You haven’t Finished.”
“Youknow—asyouhavedemonstrated atyour trial—howimpor-
tant itis.andwhy, thatweobtain allthatproperty withthevoluntary
consent ofthevictims.” Dr.Ferris opened hisbriefcase. “Here is
theGift Certificate, Mr.Rearden. Wehave filled itoutand allyou
have todoistosignyourname atthebottom.”
Thepiece ofpaper, which heplaced infront ofRearden, looked
likeasmall college diploma, with thetextprinted inold-tashioned
script andtheparticulars inserted bytypewriter. The thing stated
that he,Henry Rearden, hereby transferred tothenation allrights
tothemetal alloynowknown as“Rearden Metal,” which would
henceforth bemanufactured byallwhosodesired, andwhich would
bear thename of“Miracle Metal,” chosen bytherepresentatives of
thepeople. Glancing atthepaper, Rearden wondered whether it
wasadeliberate mockery ofdecency, orsolowanestimate oftheir
victims’ intelligence, thathadmade thedesigners ofthispaper print
thetextacross afaintdrawing oftheStatue ofLiberty.
Hiseyesmoved slowly toDr.Ferris’ face.“You would nothave
come here.” hesaid, “unless youhadsome extraordinary kind of
blackjack touseonme.What isit?”
“Ofcourse,” saidDr.Ferris. “Iwould expect you tounderstand
that.That iswhynolengthy explanations arenecessary.” Heopened
hisbriefcase. “Doyouwish toseemyblackjack? Ihavebrought a
fewsamples.”
Inthemanner ofacardsharp whisking outalong fanofcards
withonesnap ofthehand, hespread before Rearden alineofglossy
photographic prints. They were photostats ofhotel andauto court
registers, bearing inReardcn’s handwriting thenames ofMr.and
Mrs. J.Smith.
“You know, ofcourse,” saidDr.Ferris softly, “butyoumight wish
toseewhether weknow it,that Mrs. J.Smith isMissDagny
Taggart.”
Hefound nothing toobserve inRearden ’sface.Rearden hadnot
moved tobend over theprints, butsatlooking down atthem with
grave attentiveness, asif,from theperspective ofdistance, hewere
discovering something about them which hehadnotknown.
“We have agreat deal ofadditional evidence,” saidDr.Ferris,
515
andtossed down onthedesk aphotostat ofthejeweler's billforthe
ruby pendant. “You wouldn't care toseethesworn statements of
apartment-house doormen and night clerks—they contain nothing
thatwould benewtoyou,except thenumber ofwitnesses whoknow
where youspent your nights inNewYork torabout the lasttwo
years.Youmustn't blame those people toomuch. It’saninteresting
characteristic ofepochs such asours thatpeople begin tobeafraid
ofsaying thethings theywant tosay—and afraid, when questioned,
toremain silent about things they'd prefer never toutter. That isto
beexpected. Butyouwould beastonished ifyouknewwhogave us
theoriginal tip.”
“1know it,”saidRearden, hisvoice conveyed noreaction. The
triptoFlorida wasnotinexplicable tohimanylonger.
“There isnothingmthisblackjack ofmine thatcanharm you
personally,” said Dr. Ferris. “Weknew thatnoform ofpersonal
injury would evermake you give in.Therefore. Iamtelling you
frankly that this willnothurtyou atall. Itwillonly hurtMiss
Taggart.”
Rearden waslooking straight athimnow, butDr.Ferns wondered
why itseemed tohim thatthecalm, closed facewasmoving away
into agreater andgreater distance.
"Ifthis affair ofyours isspread fromoneendofthecountry to
theother,” saidDr. Ferris, “bysuch experts intheartofsmearing
asBertram Scudder, itwilldonoactual damage toyour reputation.
Beyond afewglances otcuriosity andafewraised eyebrows ina
fewofthestuffier drawing rooms, you willgetoffquite easily. Affairs
ofthis sort arcexpected ofaman. Infact, itwillenhance your
reputation. Itwillgiveyouanaura ofromantic glamour among the
women and,among themen. itwillgiveyouacertain kind ofpics-
tige, inthenature ofenvy foranunusual conquest. Butwhat itwill
dotoMissTaggart—withherspotless name, herreput ationforbeing
above scandal, herpeculiar position ofawoman inastrictly mascu-
linebusiness—what itwilldotoher,what she willsecmtheeyes
ofeveryone sfvemeets, what shewillhearfrom everymanshedeals
with—1willleave thatuptoyouiownmind toimagine. And to
consider.”
Rearden feltnothing butagreat stillness and agreat clarity It
wasasifsome voice were telling him sternly: This «sthenine— the
scene islighted—now look.And standing naked inthegreat light;
hewaslooking quietly, solemnly, stripped offear, ofpain, ofhope,
withnothing lefttohimbutthedesire toknow.
Dr.Ferris wasastonished tohearhimsayslowly, inthedispassion-
atetone ofanabstract statement thatdidnotseem tobeaddressed
tohislistener, "But allyour calculations restonthefactthatMiss
Taggart isavirtuous woman, nottheslutyou’re going tocallher.”
“Yes, ofcourse,” saidDr.Ferris.
“And that thismeans much more tomethanacasual affair.”
“Ofcourse.”
“Ifsheand Iwere thekind ofscum you're going tojmakc us
appear, your blackjack wouldn't work*”
“No, itwouldn't.”
516
“Ifourrelationship were thedepravity you’re going toproclaim
ittobe,you’d havenoway toharm us.”
“No.”
“We’d beoutside yourpower.”
“Actually— yes.”
ItwasnottoDr.Ferris thatRearden wasspeaking. Hewasseeing
along lineofmen stretched through thecenturies from Plato on-
ward, whose heirand finalproduct wasanincompetent little profes-
sorwith theappearance ofagigolo andthesoulofathug.
“Ioffered you, once, achance tojoin ns,” said Dr.Ferris. “You
refused. Nowyoucanseetheconsequences. How aman ofyour
intelligence thought thathecould winbyplaying itstraight, lcan’t
imagine.”
“But if1hadjoined you,” saidRearden, with thesame detach-
ment, asifhewere notspeaking about himself, “what would Ihave
found worth looting fromOrren Boyle?”
“Oh hell, there's always enough suckers toexpropriate inthe
world!”
“Such asMissTaggart? AsKenDanagger? AsF.llisWyatt? AsI?”
“Such asanymanwhowants tobeimpractical”
“Youmean thatuisnotpractical toliveonearth, isit?”
Hedidnotknow whether Dr.Ferris answered him.Hewasnot
listening anylonger. Hewasseeing thependulous face ofOrren
Boyle with thesmall slitsofpig’s eyes, thedoughy faceofMr.
Mowen with theeyes thatscurried away from anyspeaker andany
fact— hewasseeing them gothrough thejerky motions ofanape
performing aroutine ithadlearned tocopy bymuscular habit, per-
forming itinorder tomanufacture Rearden Metal, withnoknowl-
edge andnocapacity toknow what had taken place inthe
experimental laboratory ofRearden Steel through tenyears ofpas-
sionate devotion toanexcruciating effort. Itwasproper thatthey
should now call it“Miracle Metal”- -amiracle wastheonlyname
theycould give tothose tenyears and tothat faculty from which
Rearden Metal wasborn—amiracle was allthattheMetal could be
intheir eyes, theproduct ofanunknown, unknowable cause, an
object innature, nottobeexplained, buttobeseized, likeastone
oraweed, theirs fortheseizing— “arewetoletthemany remain
inwant while thefewwithhold from usthebetter products and
methods available?”
If Ihadnotknown thatmy lifedepends onmymind andmy
effort—hewas saying soundlessly tothe lineofmen stretched
through thecenturies—if1hadnotmade itmyhighest moral purpose
toexercise thebestofmyeffort andthefullest capacity ofmymind
inorder tosupport andexpand my life,youwould havefound noth-
ingtolootfromme,nothing tosupport yourown existence: Itisnot
mysinsthatyou're using toinjure me,butmyvirtues—myvirtues
byyourownacknowledgment, since yourown lifedepends onthem,
sinceyouneed them, sinceyoudonotseek todestroy myachieve-
ment buttoseize it.
Heremembered thevoice ofthegigolo ofscience saying tohim:
“We’re afterpower andwemean it.You fellows were pikers, but
517
weknow thereal trick.”Wewere notafterpower—hesaid tothe
gigolo's ancestors-in-spirit —andwedidnot livebymeans ofthat

Heremembered theformula ofthepunishment that Lillian had
sought toimpose onhim, theformula hehadconsidered toomon-
strous tobelieve—andhesaw itnow initsfullapplication, asa
system ofthought, asawayoflifeandonaworld scale. There it
was: thepunishment thatrequired thevictim's own virtue asthefuel
tomake itwork—hisinvention ofRearden Metal being used asthe
cause ofhisexpropriation— -Dagny’s honor andthedepth oftheir
feeling foreach other being used asatoolofblackmail, ablackmail
from which thedepraved would beimmune—and, inthePeople's
States ofEurope, millions ofmenbeing held inbondage bymeans
oftheir desire tolive,bymeans oftheir energy drained mforced
labor, bymeans oftheir ability tofeed their masters, bymeans of
thehostage system, oftheir love fortheir children orwives or
friends—bymeans oflove, ability andpleasure asthefodder for
threats andthebait forextortion, with love tiedtofear, ability to

escape from pain, notquest forpleasure, astheonly incentive to

means ofwhatever living power theypossessed andofwhatever joy
theyfound inlife.Suchwasthecode that theworld hadaccepted
andsuchwasthekey tothecode: that ithooked man’s love of
existence toacircuit oftorture, sothatonly themanwhohadnoth-
ingtooffer would have nothing tofear, sothatthevirtues which
made lifepossible andthevalues which gave itmeaning became the
agents ofitsdestruction, sothatone’s bestbecame thetoolofone’s
agony, andman’s lifeonearth became impractical.
“Yours wasthecode oflife,” saidthevoice ofamanwhom he
could notforget. “What, then, istheirs?”
Whyhadtheworld accepted it?—hethought. Howhadthevictims
come tosanction acode thatpronounced them guilty ofthefactof
existing? . . ,And then theviolence ofaninner blow*became the
total stillness ofhisbody ashesatlooking atasudden vfsion: Hadn't
hedone italso? Hadn’t hegiven hissanction totheCode ofself-
damnation? Dagny—hethought— andthedepth ofthefr feeling for
each other .. .theblackmail from which thedepraved would be
immune ,..hadn’t he,too,once called itdepravity? Hadn’t hebeen
firsttothrow ather alltheinsults which thehuman scum wasnow
518
threatening tothrow atherinpublic? Hadn't heaccepted asguilt
thehighest happiness hehadeverfound?
“Youwhowon’t allow onepercent ofimpurity intoanalloy of
metal,” theunforgotten voice wassaying tohim,“what haveyou
allowed intoyourmoral code?”
“Well, Mr.Rearden?” saidthevoice ofDr.Ferris.“Doyouunder-
standmenow?DowegettheMetal ordowemake apublic show-
place outofMiss Taggart’s bedroom?”
Hewasnotseeing Dr.Ferris.Hewasseeing—intheviolent clarity
thatwas likeaspotlight tearing every riddle open tohim—theday
hemetDagny forthe firsttime.
Itwasafewmonths after shehadbecome Vice-President ofTag-
gart Transcontinental. Hehadbeen hearing skeptically, forsome
time, therumors thattherailroad wasrunbyJimTaggart’s sister.
Thatsummer, when hegrew exasperated atTaggart’s delays and
contradictions overanorder ofrailforanew cutoff, anorder which
Taggart kept placing, altering andwithdrawing, somebody toldhim
that ifhewished togetanysense oraction outofTaggart Transcon-
tinental, he’d better speak toJim’s sister.Hetelephoned heroffice
tomake anappointment and insisted onhaving itthatsame after-
noon. Her secretary toldhim thatMiss Taggart would beatthe
construction siteofthenew cutoff, thatafternoon, atMilford Station
between NewYork andPhiladelphia, butwould beglad toseehim
there ifhewished. Hewent totheappointment resentfully; hedid
notlikesuchbusinesswomen ashehadmet,andhefeltthatrailroads
werenobusiness forawoman toplay with; heexpected aspoiled
heiress whoused hername andsexassubstitute forability, some
eyebrow-plucked, overgroomed female, likethelady executives of
department stores.
Hegotoffthelastcarofalong train, farbeyond theplatform of
Milford Station: There wasaclutter ofsidings, freight cars, cranes
andsteam shovels around him,descending from themain trackdown
theslope ofaravine where menwere grading theroadbed ofthe
new cutoff.Hestarted walking between thesidings toward thesta-
tion building. Then hestopped.
Hesawagirlstanding ontopofapileofmachinery onaflatcar.
Shewaslooking offattheravine, herhead lifted, strands ofdisor-
dered hair stirring inthewind.Her plain gray suitwas likeathin
coating ofmetal over aslender body against thespread ofsunflooded
space and sky.Herposture hadthelightness andunself-conscious
precision ofanarrogantly pure self-confidence. Shewaswatching the
work, herglance intent andpurposeful, theglance ofcompetence
enjoying itsown function. Shelooked asifthiswere herplace, her
moment andherworld, shelooked asifenjoyment were hernatural
state, herfacewastheliving form ofanactive, living intelligence, a
young girl’s facewith awoman’s mouth, sheseemed unaware ofher
body except asofatautinstrument ready toserve herpurpose in
anymanner shewished.
Hadheasked himself amoment earlier whether hecarried inhis
mindanimage ofwhat hewanted awoman tolook like,hewould
haveanswered thathedidhot; yet,seeing her,heknew that this
519
wastheimage andthat ithadbeen foryears. Buthewasnotlooking
atherasatawoman. Hehadforgotten where hewasandonwhat
errand, hewasheldbyachild’s sensation ofjoyintheimmediate
moment, bythedelight oftheunexpected andundiscovered, hewas
heldbytheastonishment otrealizing howseldom hecame upon a
sight hetruly liked, liked incomplete acceptance and for itsown
sake, hewaslooking upatherwith afaint smile, ashewould have
looked atastatue oralandscape, andwhat hefeltwasthesheer
pleasure ofthe sight, thepurest esthetic pleasure hehadever
experienced.
Hesawaswitchman going byandheasked, pointing, “Who is
that?’*
“Oagny Taggart.” saidtheman, walking on.
Rearden feltasifthewords struck himinside histhroat. Hefell
thestart ofacurrent thatcuthisbreath foramoment, thenwent
slowly down hisbody, carrying mitswake asense ofweight, a
drained heaviness that lefthimnocapacity butone.Hewasaware--
withanabnormal clarity —oftheplace, thewoman’s name, andev-
erything itimplied, but allofithadreceded intosome outer ring
andhadbecome apressure that lefthimalone inthecenter, asthe
ring’s meaning andessence— and hisonly reality wasthedesire to
have thiswoman, now, here,ontopoftheflatcar intheopen sun—
tohave herbefore awordwasspoken between them, asthe first act
oftheir meeting, because itwould sayeverything andbecause they
hadearned itlong ago.
Sheturned herhead. Intheslowcurve ofthemovement, hereyes
came tohisandstopped. He feltcertain thatshesawthenature of
hisglance, thatshewasheldby it,yetdidnotname ittoherself.
Hereyesmoved onandbesawherspeak tosomemanwhostood
beside theflatcar, taking notes.
Two things struck himtogether: hisreturn tohisnormal reality,
andtheshattering impact ofguilt.Hefeltamoment’s approach to
thatwhich nomanmay feelfullyandsurvive: asense ofselfhatred-
themore terrible because some part ofhimrefused toaccept itand
made him feel guiltier, itwasnotaprogression ofwords, butthe
instantaneous verdict ofanemotion, averdict that toldhim: This,
then,washisnature, thiswas hisdepravity—thattheshameful desire
hehadnever been able toconquer, came tohim inresponse tothe
only sight ofbeauty hehadfound, that itcame with aviolence he
hadnotknown tobepossible, and that theonlyfreedom now left
tohimwastohide it,andtodespise himself, butnever toberidof
itsolong asheand thiswoman were alive.
Hedidnotknowhow longhestood there orwhat devastation
thatspan oftime leftwithin him. Allthathecould prescivq wasthe
willtodecide thatshemust neverknow it.
Hewaited until shehaddescended totheground and jlheman
withthenotes haddeparted; thenheapproached herandsajd coldly:
“Miss Taggart? 1amHenry Rcardcn.”
“Ohl” Itwasjustasmall break, thenheheard thequietly natural
“How doyoudo,Mr.Rearden.”
Heknew, notadmitting ittohimself, that thebreak cajme from
520
some faint equivalent ofhisown feeling: shewasglad thataface
shehadliked belonged toamanshecould admire. When hepro-
ceeded tospeak toherabout business, hismanner wasmore harshly
abrupt than ithadeverbeen withanyofhismasculine customers.
Now, looking from thememory ofthe girlontheflatcar tothe
Gift Certificate lyingonhisdesk, hefeltasifthetwometinasingle
shock, fusing allthedaysanddoubts hehad lived between them,
and,bytheglare oftheexplosion, inamoment’s vision ofafinal
sum, hesawtheanswer toallhisquestions.
Hethought: Guilty?—guiltier than fhadknown, farguiltier than
1hadthought, thatday-guilty oftheevilofdamning asguilt that
which wasmybest. Idamned thefactthatmymind andbody were
aunit,and thatmybody responded tothevalues ofmymind. I
damned thefactthatjoy isthecore ofexistence, themotive power
ofcveiy living being, that itistheneed ofone's body asitisthe
goal ofone’s spirit, thatmybody wasnotaweight ofinanimate
muscles, butaninstrument able togivemeanexperience ofsuperla-
tivejoytounitemy flesh andmy spirit. That capacity, which 1
damned asshameful, had leftmeindilfeient tosluts, butgaveme
myonedesire inanswer toawoman’s greatness. That desire, which
Idamned asobscene, didnotcome from thesight ofherbody, but
from theknowledge that Ihelovely form 1sawdidexpress thespirit
1wasseeing” itwasnotherbody that 1wanted, butherperson— it
wasnotthe girl ingray that Ihad topossess, butthewoman who
ranarailtoad
But 1damned mybody’s capacity toexpress what Tfelt, 1damned,
asanaffront toher,thehighest tubule 1could giveherjustasthey
damnmyability totranslate thework otmymind intoReardon
Metal, justastheydamnmeforthepower totransform matter to

me,thatthevalues ofone’s spirit mustremain asanimpotent long-
ing,unexpressed inaction, untranslated into reality, while the lifeof
one’sbodymust belived inmisery, asasenseless, degrading perfor-
mance, andthosewhoattempt toenjoy itmust bebranded asinfe-
rioranimals.
1broke their code, but Itellintothetrapthey intended, thetrap
ofacode devised tobebroken. 1tooknopride inmyrebellion, l
took itasguilt, ldidnotdamn them, Idamned myself, Ididnot
damn their axle. Idamned existence—and Ihidmyhappiness asa
shameful secret. Ishould have lived itopenly, asofourright—or
made hermywife, asintruth shewas.But Ibranded myhappiness
asevilandmade herbear itasadisgrace. What theywant todoto
hernow, 1did itfirst, Imade itpossible.
Idid it--inthename ofpity forthemost contemptible woman I
know. That, too,was their code, and Iaccepted it.ibelieved that
oneperson owes aduty toanother withnopayment for itinreturn.
1believed that itwasmyduty tolove awoman whogavemenothing,
whobetrayed everything 1lived for,whodemanded herhappiness
attheprice ofmine. [believed that love issome static giftwhich,
once granted, neednolonger bedeserved— justasthey believe that
wealth isastatic possesion which canbeseized andheld without
521
further effort. Ibelieved thatlove isagratuity, notareward tobe
earned justasthey believe itistheir right todemand anunearned
wealth. And justasthey believe that theirneed isaclaim onmy
energy, soIbelieved thatherunhappiness wasaclaim onmy life.
Forthesake ofpity,notjustice, Iendured tenyears ofself-torture.
Iplaced pityabovemyown conscience, and this isthecore ofmy
guilt.Mycrime wascommitted when Isaidtoher,“Byevery stan-
dard ofmine, tomaintain ourmarriage willbeavicious fraud. But
mystandards arenotyours. Idonotunderstand yours, Inever have,
but 1willaccept them.”
Here they are,lyingonmydesk, those standards Iaccepted with-
outunderstanding, here isthemanner ofherlove forme,thatlove
which Inever believed, buttried tospare. Here isthefinalproduct
oftheunearned. Ithought that itwasproper tocommit injustice, so
long asIwould betheonlyonetosuffer. Butnothing canjustify
injustice. And this isthepunishment foraccepting asproper that
hideous evilwhich isself-immolation. Ithought that Iwould bethe
only victim. Instead. I’ve sacrificed thenoblest woman tothe vilest.
When one actsonpity against justice, itisthegoodwhom one
punishes forthesake ofthe evil;when onesaves theguilty from
suffering, itistheinnocent whom oneforces tosuffer. There isno
escape from justice, nothing canbeunearned andunpaid forinthe
universe, neither inmatter nor inspirit—and iftheguilty donot
pay,then theinnocent have topay it.
Itwasnotthecheap little looters ofwealth whohavebeaten me—
itwas I.They didnotdisarm me—Ithrew awaymyweapon. This
isabattle thatcannot befought except with clean hands—because
theenemy’s solepower isinthesores ofone’s conscience—and I
accepted acode thatmademeregard thestrength ofmyhands as
asinandastain.
“DowegettheMetal, Mr.Rearden?”
Helooked from theGift Certificate onhisdesk tothememory
ofthe girlontheflatcar. Heasked himself whether hecould deliver
theradiant being hehadseen inthatmoment, tothelooters ofthe
mind andthethugs ofthepress. Could hecontinue tolettheinno-
centbearpunishment? Could helethertake thestand heshould
havetaken? Could henowdefy theenemy’s code,when thedisgrace
would behers, nothis—when themuck would bethrown ather,not
athim—when shewould have tofight, while he’dbespared? Could
heletherexistence beturned into ahellhewould havenoway
ofsharing?
Hesat still,looking upather. 1loveyou,hesaid tothe girlon
theflatcar, silently pronouncing thewords thathadbeen themeaning
ofthatmoment four years ago, feeling thesolemn happiness that
belonged with thewords, eventhough thiswashowhebadtosay
ittoherforthe firsttime.{
Helooked down attheGift Certificate. Dagny, hethought, you
would not letmedo itifyouknew, you willhatemefo<itifyou

Iwillnotshift toyouthepunishment which ismine tot*ke.Even
ifIhave nothing elsenow lefttome, 1have thismuch: that 1see
522
thetruth, that 1amfreeoftheir guilt, that Icumnowstand guiltless
inmyown eyes, that 1know 1amright, right fullyandforthe first
time—and that Iwillremain faithful totheonecommandment of
mycode which Ihave never broken: tobeamanwhopays his

1loveyou,hesaid tothe girlontheflatcar, feeling asifthefight

standing under anopen skyoveranunobstructed earth, withnothing
lefttohimexcept himself.
“Well, Mr.Rearden? Areyougoing tosign?” asked Dr.Ferris.
Rearden’s eyesmoved tohim.Hehadforgotten that Ferris was
there, hedidnotknow whether Ferris hadbeen speaking, arguing
orwaiting insilence.
“Oh, that?” saidRearden.
Hepicked upapenandwithnosecond glance, with theeasy
gesture ofamillionaire signing acheck, hesigned hisname atthe

thedesk.
Chapter VIITHEMORATORIUM ONBRAINS
“Where have youbeen allthistime?” Eddie Willers asked the

resigned forgood. Jim isscared todeath that hisfriends inWashing-
tonwilltake itoutonhim. ifitbecomes known that she’s quit. It’s
supposed tobedisastrous forpublic morale, ifanyprominent person
quits, andJimdoesn’t wantthem toknow that he’sgotadeserter
right inhisown family. . .But that’s not all.Jim isscared thatthe
stockholders, theemployees andwhoever wedobusiness with, will
losethe lastoftheir confidence inTaggart Transcontinental ifthey
learn thatshe's gone. Confidence! You’d think that itwouldn’t mat-
ternow, since there’s nothing anyotthem candoabout it.And yet
Jimknows thatwehave topreserve some semblance ofthegreatness
thatTaggart Transcontinental once stood for.Andheknows that
the lastof itwent with her. . . .No.they don’t know' where she
is. . . .Yes, Ido.but Iwon't tellthem I'mtheonlyonewho
knows. .. .Oh, yes,they’ve been trying tofind out.They've tried
topumpmeineverywaytheycould think of,but it’snouse. Iwon’t
tellanyone. . .Youshould seethetrained seal thatwenowhave
inherplace—ournewOperating Vice-President Ohsure,wehave
one—that is.wehave andwehaven’t It’slikeeverything theydo
today—itisand itain’t, atthesame time. Hisname isClitton
Locey—he’sfrom Jim’s personal staff— abright, progressive young
man offorty-seven andafriend ofJim’s. He’s onlysupposed tobe
pinch-hitting forher,but he.sits inheroffice andwe allknow that
that’s thenewOperating Vice-President. Hegives theorders—that
is,hesees toitthat he’snever caught actually giving anorder. He
works veryhard atmaking sure thatnodecision caneverbepinned
down onhim, sothathewon’t beblamed foranything. You see, hi*
purpose isnottooperate arailroad, buttohold ajob.Hedoesn’t
want toruntrains—hewants toplease Jim.Hedoesn’t give adamn
whether there’s asingle trainmoving ornot,solong ashecanmake
agood impression onJimandontheboys inWashington. Sofar,
Mr.Clifton Locey hasmanaged toframe uptwomen: ayoung third
assistant, fornotrelaying anorder which Mr.Locey hadnever
given—and thefreight manager, forissuing anorder which Mr,
Locey didgive,only thefreight manager couldn’t prove if.Bothmen
were fired, officially, byruling oftheUnification Board! .. .When
things gowell—which isnever longer than halfanhour-^-Mr. Locey
makes itapoint toremind usthat ‘these arcnotthedays ofMiss
Taggart.’ Atthe firstsignoftrouble, hecallsmeintoh&office and
asksme—casually, inthemidst ofthemost irrelevant drivel—what
MissTaggart used todoinsuchanemergency. Itellhini,whenever
524
1can. 1tellmyself that it'sTaggart Transcontinental, and . ..and
there’s thousands oflives indozens oftrains thathangonourdeci-
sions. Between emergencies, Mr.Locey goes outofhisway tobe
rude tome— that's so Iwouldn’t think thatheneeds me.He’smade
itapoint tochange everything sheused todo,inevery respect that
doesn’t matter, huthe’sdamn cautious nottochange anything that
matters. The only trouble isthathecan talways tellwhich is
which. ...Onhisfirstday inheroffice, hetoldmethat itwasn’t a
good idea tohave apicture ofNatTaggart onthewall—‘NatTag-
gart,’ hesaid, ‘belongs toadark past, totheageofselfish greed, he
isnotexactly asymbol ofourmodern, progressive policies, so it
couldmake abadimpression, people could identify mewith him,’
‘No, they couldn’t,* lsaid—but Itook thepicture offhiswall. ...
What? .. .No.shedoesn't know anyof it. 1haven’t communicated
with her.Notonce. She toldmenot to. . . .Lastweek, 1almost

because nothing hadhappened allthese years, soWinston could do

Tmhoping for.Nothing, Iguess. Ijustgodaybyday,and Itrynot
tolook ahead. At first, Ihoped thatsomebody would save us. I
thought maybe itwould beHank Rearden. Buthegave in. Idon’t
know what they didtohim tomake him sign, but Iknow that it
must have been something terrible. Everybody thinks so.Every-
body’s whispering about it,wondering what sortofpressure wasused
onhim. ...No,nobody knows. He’smade nopublic statements and
he’srefused toseeanyone. . ..But, listen. I’ll tellyousomething
else thateverybody’s whispering about. Lean closer, willyou?—1
don’t want tospeak tooloudly. They saythatOrren Boyle seems to
haveknown about that directive long ago,weeks ormonths inad-
vance, because hehad started, quietly and secretly, toreconstruct
hisfurnaces fortheproduction ofRearden Metal, inoneofhislesser
steel plants, anobscure little placewayoutonthecoast ofMaine.
Hewasready tostart pouring theMetal themoment Rcarden’s
extortion paper—Imean. Gift Certificate—wassigned. But—listen—
thenight before theywere tostart, Boyle’s menwere heating the
furnaces inthatplaceonthecoast, when theyheard avoice, they
didn’t know whether itcame from aplane oraradio orsome sort
ofloudspeaker, but itwasaman’s voice and itsaid thathewould
givethem tenminutes togetoutoftheplace. They gotout.They
started going andthey keptongoing—because theman’s voice had
said thathewasRagnar DanneskjOld. Inthenext half-hour, Boyle’s
millswere razed totheground. Razed, wiped out,notabrick of
them leftstanding. They say itwasdone bylong-range naval guns,
fromsomewhere wayoutontheAtlantic. Nobody sawDanneskjOld’s
ship. . . .That’s what people were whispering. Thenewspapers
haven’t printed aword about it.Theboys inWashington saythat
it’sonlyarumor spread bypanic-mongers. ... Idon’tknow whether

Itwasadark road, but itledinanew direction. Rearden walked
from hismills, nottoward hishouse, buttoward thecityofPhiladel-
phia. itwasagreat distance towalk, buthehadwanted todo it
tonight, ashehaddone itevery evening ofthepastweek.He felt
atpeace intheempty darkness ofthecountryside, withnothing but
theblack shapes oftrees around him, withnomotion butthatof
hisownbodyandofbranches stirring inthewind, withnolights but
theslow sparks ofthe fireflies flickering through thehedges. The
twohours between millsand citywere hisspan ofrest.
Hehadmoved outofhishome toanapartment inPhiladelphia.
Hehadgiven noexplanation tohismother and Philip, hehadsaid
nothing except thattheycould remain inthehouse iftheywished
andthatMiss Iveswould takecareoftheir bills.Hehadasked them
totellLillian, when shereturned, thatshewasnottoattempt tosee
him.They hadstared athim interrified silence.
Hehadhanded tohisattorney asigned blank check and said,
’Getmeadivorce. Onanygrounds and atany cost. Idon't care
whatmeans you use,howmany oftheir judges youpurchase or
whether you find itnecessary tostage aframe-up ofmywife.Do
whatever youwish. Butthere istobenoalimony andnoproperty
settlement11Theattorney hadlooked athimwith thehintofawise,
sadsmile, asitthiswere anevent hehadexpected tohappen long
ago.Hehadanswered, "'Okay, Hank. Itcanbedone. But itwill
takesome time.” “Make itasfastasyouam.”
Noonehadquestioned himabout hissignature ontheGiftCer-
tificate. Buthehadnoticed that themen atthemillslooked athim
with akind ofsearching curiosity, almost asiftheyexpected tofind
thescars ofsome physical torture onhisbody.
Hefellnothing- -nothing butthesense ofaneven, restful twilight,
likeaspread ofslagoveramolten metal, when itcrusts andswallows
thelast brilliant spurt ofthewhite glow within. He feltnothing at
thethought ofthelooters whowerenowgoing tomanufacture Rear-
denMetal. Hisdesire tohold hisright toitandproudly tobethe
onlyonetosell it,hadbeen hisform ofrespect forhisfellow men,
hisbelief that totrade withthem wasanactofhonor. The belief,
therespect andthedesire were gone.Hedidnotcarewhatmen
made, what they sold,where theybought hisMetal orwhether any
ofthemwould know that ithadbeen his.Thehuman shapes moving
pasthim inthestreets ofthecitywere physical objects without any
meaning. The countryside —with thedarkness washing away all
traces ofhuman activity, leaving onlyanuntouched earth which he
hadoncebeen able tohandle—was real.
Hecarried agun inhispocket, asadvised bythepolicemen of
theradio carthatpatrolled theroads; theyhadwarned himthatno
roadwassafeafter dark, these days.He felt,withatouch ofmirthless
527
amusement, thatthegunhadbeenneeded atthemills, notinthe
peaceful safety ofloneliness and night; what could some starving
vagrant takefrom him,compared towhathadbeen taken bymen
whoclaimed tobehisprotectors?
Hewalked withaneffortless speed, feeling relaxed byaform of
activity thatwasnatural tohim.Thiswas hisperiod oftraining for
solitude, hethought; hehadtolearn tolivewithout anyawareness
ofpeople, theawareness thatnowparalyzed himwith revulsion. He
hadonce built hisfortune, starting outwithempty hands; nowhe
hadtorebuild his life,starting outwithanempty spirit.
Hewould givehimself ashort span oftime forthetraining, he
thought, andthenhewould claim theoneincomparable value still
lefttohim, theonedesire thathadremained pureandwhole: he
would gotoDagny. Twocommandments hadgrown inhismind;
onewasaduty, theother apassionate wish.The firstwasnever to
letherlearn thereason ofhissurrender tothelooters; thesecond
wastosaytoherthewords which heshould haveknown attheir first
meeting andshould have saidonthegallery ofEllisWyatt’s house.
There wasnothing butthestrong summer starlight toguide him.
ashewalked, buthecould distinguish thehighway andtheremnant
ofastone fence ahead, atthecomer ofacountry crossroad. The
fence hadnothing toprotect anylonger, only aspread ofweeds, a
willow treebending over theroad and, farther inthedistance, the
ruinofafarmhouse with thestarlight showing through itsroof.
Hewalked, thinking thateven thissight stillretained thepower
tobeofvalue: itgavehim thepromise ofalong stretch ofspace
undisturbed byhuman intrusion.
Themanwhostepped suddenly outintotheroadmust havecome
from behind thewillow tree, butsoswiftly that itseemed asifhe
hadsprung upfrom themiddle ofthehighway. Rearden’s handwent
totheguninhispocket, butstopped: heknew—bytheproud posture
ofthebody standing intheopen, bythestraight lineoftheshoulders
against thef starlit sky—that themanwasnotabandit. When he
heard thevoice, heknew thatthemanwasnotabeggar.
“fshould liketospeak toyou,Mr.Rearden.”
Thevoice hadthefirmness, theclarity andthespecial courtesy
peculiar tomenwho areaccustomed togiving orders.
“Goahead,” saidRearden, “provided youdon’t intend toaskme
forhelpormoney.”
Theman’s garments were rough, but efficiently trim.Hewore
dark trousers andadark bluewindbreakcr closed tight athisthroat,
prolonging thelinesofhislong, slender figure. Hewore adark blue
cap,and allthatcould beseen ofhim inthenight were hishands,
hisfaceandapatch ofgold-blond haironhistemple; Thehands
heldnoweapon, only apackage wrapped inburlap, thesizeofa
carton ofcigarettes.
“No,Mr.Rearden,” hesaid, “Idon’t intend toaskyo^formoney,
buttoreturn ittoyou.”
“Toreturn money?”
“Yes.”
“What money?”
528
“Asmall refund onavery large debt/*
“Owed byyou?”
“No, notbyme. Itisonly atoken payment, but Iwantyouto
iccept itasproof that ifwelivelongenough, youand 1,every dollar
>fthatdebt willbereturned toyou.”
“What debt?”
“Themoney thatwastaken fromyoubyforce.”
Heextended thepackage toRearden, flipping theburlap open.
Bearden sawthestarlight runlike firealong amirror-smooth surface,
-leknew, byitsweight andtexture, thatwhat heheldwasabarof
olidgold.
Helooked from thebartotheman's face, butthefaceseemed
larder and lessrevealing than thesurface ofthemetal.
“Who areyou?” asked Rearden.
“The friend ofthefriendless.”
“Didyoucome here togive thistome?”
“Yes.”
“Doyoumean thatyouhadtostalkmeatnight, onalonely road,
norder, nottorobme,buttohandmeabarofgold?”
“Yes.”
“Why?”
“When robbery isdone inopen daylight bysanction ofthelaw,
isitisdone today, then any actofhonoi orrestitution hastobe
ndden underground.”
“What made youthink thatVdaccept agiftofthiskind?”
“It isnotagift,Mr.Rearden. Itisyourownmoney. But 1have
>nefavor toaskolyou. Itisarequest, notacondition, because
herecanbenosuch thing asconditional property. Thegold isyours,
>oyouarefreetouse itasyouplease. But Iriskedmy lifetobring

inure orspend itonyourself. Onnothing butyourowncomfort
tndpleasure. Donotgive itaway and,above all,donotput itinto
vourbusiness.”
“Because 1don’t want ittobeofanybenefit toanybody butyou.
Otherwise, 1willhave broken anoath taken long ago—as Iam
creaking every rule Ihadsetformyself byspeaking toyoutonight.”
“What doyoumean?”
“Ihavebeen collecting thismoney foryouforalong time. But I
Jidnotintend toseeyouortellyouabout itorgive ittoyou until
much later.”
“Then whydidyou?”
“Because lcouldn’t stand itanylonger.”
“Stand what?”
“Ithought that Ihadseeneverything onecould seeandthatthere
wasnothing Icould notstand seeing. Butwhen theytookRearden
Metalaway from you, itwastoomuch, even forme. Iknow that
youdon’t need thisgold atpresent. What youneed isthejustice
which itrepresents, andtheknowledge thatthere aremenwhocare
lorjustice,.”
Struggling nottogive intoanemotion which hefeltrising through
hisbewilderment, past allhisdoubts, Rearden tried tostudy the
529
man’s face, searching forsome cluetohelphimunderstand. Butthe
facehadnoexpression; ithadnotchanged once while speaking; it
looked asifthemanhad lostthecapacity tofeellong ago,andwhat
remained ofhimwere only features thatseemed implacable and
dead. With ashudder ofastonishment, Reardcn found himself think-
ingthat itwasnotthefaceofaman, butofanavenging angel.
“Why didyoucare?" asked Rearden. "What do 1mean toyou?”
"Much more thanyouhave reason tosuspect. And lhave afriend
towhom youmeanmuch more thanyou willever learn.Hewould
have given anything tostand byyoutoday. Buthecan’tcome to
you.So lcame inhisplace."
"What friend?"
"Iprefer nottoname him."
"Didyousaythatyou've spent alongtime collecting thismoney
forme?"
"1have collected much more than this."Hepointed atthegold
"lamholding itinyourname and 1willturn itover toyouwhen
thetimecomes. This isonly asample, asproof that itdoes exist.
And ifyoureach thedaywhen youfindyourself robbed ofthe last
ofyour fortune, Iwantyoutoremember thatyouhave alarge bank
account waiting foryou."
"What account?"
"Ifyou trytothink ofallthemoney thathasbeen taken from
youbyforce, you willknow thatyouraccount represents aconsider-
ablesum."
"How didyou collect it?Where didthisgoldcome from?"
"Itwastaken from thosewhorobbed you."
"Taken bywhom?"
"Byme."
"Who areyou?"
"Ragnar DanneskjOld."
Rearden looked athimforalong, stillmoment, then letthegold
falloutof)iishands.
Danneskjdld's eyes didnotfollow ittotheground, butremained
fixedonRearden withnochange ofexpression. "Would yourather
Iwere alaw-abiding citizen, Mr.Rearden? Ifso,which lawshould
Iabide by?Directive 10-289?"
"Ragnar Danneskjokl ..saidRearden, asifhewere seeing the
whole ofthepastdecade, asifhewere looking attheenormity of
acrime spread through tenyearsandheld within twowords.
“Look more carefully, Mr.Rearden. There areonlytwomodes of
living lefttoustoday: tobealooter whorobsdisarmed victims or
tobeavictim whoworks forthebenefit ofhisown despoilers. Idid
notchoose tobeeither."t
"You chose tolivebymeans offorce, liketheresto(them."
"Yes—openly. Honestly, ifyou will. Idonotrob who arc

Rearden, thenwho istheman ofhigher morality: IorWesley

“Ihavenoanswer togiveyou,” saidRearden, hisvoice low.
“Why should youbeshocked, Mr.Rearden? Iammerely comply-
ingwith thesystem whichmyfellow menhave established. Ifthey
believe thatforce istheproper means todealwithoneanother, I
amgiving them what theyask for. Ifthey believe thatthepurpose
ofmy life istoserve them, letthem trytoenforce their creed. If
they believe thatmymind istheir property—letthemcome and

“Butwhat sortoflifehaveyouchosen? Towhat purpose areyou
giving yourmind?”
“Tothecause ofmylove.”
“Which iswhat?”
“Justice.”
“Served bybeing apirate?”
“Byworking forthedaywhen Iwon't have tobeapirate any
longer.”
“Which day isthat?”
“Thedaywhen you’ll befreetomake aprofitonRearden Metal.”
“OhGod!” saidRearden, laughing, hisvoice desperate. “Isthat
\ourambition?”
DanneskjOld's face didnotchange. “Itis.”
“Doyouexpect tolivetosecthatday?”
“Yes. Don’t you?”
“No.”
“Then what areyoulooking forward to,Mr.Rearden?”
“Nothing.”
“What areyouworking for?”
Rearden glanced athim.“Why doyouaskthat?”
“Tomake youunderstand whyI’mnot.”
“Don’t expect meever toapprove ofacriminal”
“Idon’t expect it.Butthere areafewthings 1want tohelpyou
tosee.”
“Even ifthey're true, thethings you said,whydidyouchoose to
beabandit? Why didn’t yousimply step out, like—”Hestopped.
“Like Ellis Wyatt, Mr.Rearden? LikeAndrew Stockton? Like
vour friend KenDanagger?”
“Yes!”
“Would youapprove ofthat?”
”1—”Hestopped, shocked byhisownwords.
Theshock thatcame nextwastoseeDanneskjftld smile: itwas
likeseeing the firstgreen ofspring onthesculptured planes ofan
ueherg. Rearden realized suddenly, forthe firsttime, thatDannesk-
jold’s facewasmore thanhandsome, that ithadthestartling beauty
efphysical perfection—thehard, proud features, thescornful mouth
aViking’s statue—yethehadnotbeen aware ofit,almost asif
thedead sternness ofthefacehadforbidden theimpertinence ofan
appraisal. ‘Butthesmile was brilliantly alive.

531
ofmyown. I'mafter amanwhom Iwant todestroy. Hediedmany
centuries ago,butuntil the lasttrace ofhim iswiped outofmen's
minds, wewillnothave adecent world tolive in.’*
“What man?"
“Robin Hood,"
Rearden looked athimblankly, notunderstanding,
“Hewasthemanwhorobbed therichandgave tothepoor. Well,
I'mthemanwho robs thepoor andgives totherich- -or, tobe
exact, themanwhorobs thethieving poorandgives back tothe

“What inblazes doyoumean?”
“Ifyouremember thestories you’ve readaboutmeinthenewspa-
pers. before theyslopped printing them, youknow that Ihave never

have Ie\errobbed amilitary vessel—because thepurpose ofamili-

every loot-earner thatcame within range ofmyguns, every govern-

thatofallhuman symbols, Robin Hood isthemostimmoral andthe
most contemptible, there willbenojustice onearth andnowayfor
mankind tosurvive.”
Rearden listened, feeling numb. Butunder thenumbness, likethe
firstthrust ofaseedbreaking through, hefeltanemotion hecould
notidentify except that itseemed familiar andvery distant, like
something experienced andrenounced long ago.
“What Iactually am,Mr,Rearden, isapoliceman. Itisapolice-
man’s duty toprotect menfrom criminals—criminals being those
who seize wealth byforce. Itisapoliceman’s duty toretrieve stolen
property andreturn itloitsowners. Butwhen robbery becomes
thepurpose ofthelaw,andthepoliceman’s dutybecomes, notthe
protection, buttheplunder ofproperty—then itisanoutlaw whohas
tobecome apoliceman. Ihavebeen selling thecargoes Iretrieved to
some special customers ofmine inthiscountry, whopaymeingold.
Also, Ihavebeen sellingmycargoes tothesmugglers andtheblack*
market traders ofthePeople’s States ofEurope. Doyouknow the
conditions ofexistence inthose People’s States? Since production
andtrade-— notviolence- -were decreed tobecrimes, thebestmen
ofEurope hadnochoice buttobecome criminals The slave-drivers
ofthose States arekept inpower bythehandouts from their fellow
looters incountries notyetfully drained, such asthiscountry', Ido
nut letthehandouts reach them. 1sellthegoods toEurope’s law-
breakeis; atthehighest prices 1can get.and lmake them payme
mgold.Gold istheobjective value, themeans ofpreserving one’s
wealth andone’s future. Nobody ispermitted tohave gold inEurope,
except thewhip-wielding friends ofhumanity, whoclaim thatthey
spend itforthewelfare oftheii victims. That isthegoldwhichmy
smuggler-customers obtain topayme.How? Bythesamemethod l
usetoobtain thegoods. And then Ireturn thegold tothose from
whom thegoods were stolen—toyou, Mr.Rearden, andtoother
men likeyou.”
Rearden grasped thenature oftheemotion hehadforgotten. It

ning hisplace inaworld herespected andearning theiccognition

upon gray layer ofcontempt, ofindignation, ofhisstruggle notto
lookaround him,nottoseethose hedealt with, nottoexpect any-
thingfrommenandtokeep, asaprivate vision within thefourwalls
ofhisoffice, thesense ofthatworld intowhich hehadhoped to

age,thatfeeling ofquickened interest, oflistening totheluminous
533
andknew thattheausterity ofthemarble facewastheform ofa
disciplined capacity tofeeltoodeeply. Theeven voice wascontinu-
ingdispassionately:
“Iwanted youtoknow this. Iwanted you toknow itnow,when
itmustseem toyouthatyou’re abandoned atthebottom ofapit
among subhuman creatures who are allthat's leftofmankind. I
wanted youtoknow, inyourmost hopeless hour, that thedayof
deliverance ismuch closer thanyouthink.And there wasonespecial
reason why Ihadtospeak toyouand tellyoumysecret ahead of
theproper time.Have youheard ofwhathappened toOrren Boyle's
steel millsonthecoast ofMaine?”
“Yes.” saidReardcn—andwasshocked tohear that theword
came asagasp outofthesudden joltofeagerness within him. ”1
didn't know whether itwastrue.”
“It's true. 1did it.Mr.Boyle isnotgoing tomanufacture Reatden
Metal onthecoast ofMaine. He isnotgoing tomanufacture it
anywhere. Neither isanyother looting lousewho thinks thatadirec-
tivecangivehimaright toyour brain. Whoever attempts toproduce
that Metal, will find hisfurnaces blown up,hismachinery blasted,
hisshipments wrecked, hisplant setonfire— somany things will
happen toanymanwho tries it,thatpeople willsavthere's acurse
on it,andthere willsoon benoworker inthecountry willing to
enter theplant ofanynewproducer ofReardon Metal. Ifmen like
Boyle think thatforce isalltheyneed torobtheir betters-— letthem
seewhat happens when oneoftheir betters chooses toresort to
force, Iwanted you toknow, Mr.Reardon, thatnone ofthem will
produce your Metal normake apenny ontt,”
Because hefeltanexultant desire tolaugh— ashehadlaughed at
thenews ofWyatt's fire, ashehadlaughed atthecrash ofd’Ancomu
Copper—ai?dknew that ifhedid, thething hefeared would hold
him,would notrelease him thistune, andhewould never see his
mills again—Reardcn drew back and, loramoment, kept hislips
dosed tight toutternosound. When themoment wasover, hesaid
quietly, hisvoice firmanddead, “Take thatgold ofyours andget
awayfrom here. Iwon't accept thehelp ofacriminal.”
Danneskjdld’s faceshowed noreaction. “Icannot force you to
accept thegold, Mr.Rearden. But Iwillnottake itback.Youmay
leave itlyingwhere itis,ifyouwish.”
“Idon’t want your helpand 1don’t intend toprotect you. If I

Abeam oflight hitthem with theviolence olaphysical blow.
Theclangor ofthetrainhadswallowed thenoise ofthemotor and
theyhadnotheard theapproach ofthecarthatswept outofthe
side road, from behind thefarmhouse. They were not inthecar’s
path, yettheyheard thescreech ofbrakes behind thetwoheadlights,
pulling aninvisible shape toaslop. ItwasReardon whojumped
hack involuntarily andhadtime tomarvel athiscompanion: the
swiftness ofDanneskjbld sself-control wasthathedidnotmove.
Itwasapolice carand itstopped beside them.
Thedriver leaned out."Oh, itsyou.Mr.Reardon!” hesaid,touch-
inghislingers tohiscap.“Good evening, sir.”
"Hello,” saidRearden, fighting tocontrol theunnatural abruptness
ofhisvoice
There weretwopatrolmen inthefront seatofthecarand their
faceshadatightlookofpurpose, notthelookoftheir usual friendly
intention tostop forachat.
“Mr. Rearden, didyouwalkfrom themillsbywayofEdgewood
Road, pastBlacksmith Cove?”
“Yes.Why?”
“Did youhappen toseeamananywhere around these parts, a
stranger moving along inahurry?”
“Where?”
“He’d beeither onfoolorinabattered wreck ofacarthat’s got
amillion-dollar motor.”
“What man?”
“A tallman withblond hair,”
“Who ishe?”
“You wouldn’t believe itifItoldyou,Mr.Rearden. Didyou
seehim?”
Rearden wasnotaware ofhisown questions, only oftheaston-
ishing factthathewasable toforce sounds pastsome beating barrier
inside histhroat. Hewaslooking straight atthepoliceman, buthe
feltasifthefocus ofhiseyeshadswitched tohisside vision, and
whathesawmost clearly wasDanneskj&ld’s facewatching himwith
537
noexpression* withnoline's, nomuscle's worth offeeling. Hesaw
DantieskjOld’sarmshanging idlybyhissides, thehands relaxed, with
nosignofintention toreach foraweapon, leaving the tall,straight
body defenseless andopen—open astoafiring squad. Hesaw, in
thelight, thatthefacelooked younger thanhehadthought andthat
theeyeswere sky-blue. He feltthat hisonedanger would beto
glance directly atDanneskjOld —andhekept hiseyesonthepolice-
man,onthebrass buttons ofablue uniform, buttheobject filling
hisconsciousness, more forcefully thanavisual perception, wasDan-
neskjold’s body, thenaked body under theclothes, thebody that
would bewiped outofexistence. Hedidnothear hisownwords,
because hekepthearing asingle sentence inhismind, without con-
textexcept thefeeling that itwastheonly thing thatmattered to
him intheworld: “If Ishould losemy life,towhat better purpose
could Igive it?”
“Didyouseehim,Mr.Rearden?”
“No,” saidRearden. “Ididn’t.”
Thepoliceman shrugged regretfully andclosed hishands about the
steering wheel. “You didn’t secanyman thatlooked suspicious?”
“No.”
“Nor anystrange carpassing youontheroad?”
“No.”
Thepoliceman reached forthestarter. “They gotword thathe
wasseenashore inthese parts tonight, andthey’ve thrown adragnet
over fivecounties. Werenotsupposed tomention hisname, notto
scare folks, buthe’samanwhose head isworth three million dollars
inrewards from allover theworld.”
Hehadpressed thestarter andthemotor waschurning the air
with bright cracks ofsound, when thesecond policeman leaned for-
ward.Hehadbeen looking attheblond hairunder Danneskjold’s
cap.
“Who isthat,Mr.Rearden?” heasked.
“Mynewbodyguard,” saidRearden.
“Oh.
'.
!Asensible precaution, Mr.Rearden, intimes likethese.”
“Good night, sir.”
Themotor jerked forward. The red taillights ofthecarwent
shrinking down theroad. Danneskjbld watched itgo,then glanced
pointedly atRearden ’sright hand. Rearden realized thathehad
stood facing thepolicemen with hishand clutching thegun inhis
pocket andthathehadbeen prepared touse it.
Heopened hisfingers anddrew hishand outhastily, Danneskjbld
smiled. Itwasasmile ofradiant amusement, thesilent laughter of
aclear, young spirit greeting amoment itwasglad tohave lived.
Andalthough thetwodidnotresemble each other, thesmilemade
Rearden think ofFrancisco d’Anconia.
“You haven’t toldalie,” saidRagnar Danneskjold. “Your body-
guard—that’s what Iamandwhat I’lldeserve tobe,|nmany more
ways thanyoucanknow atpresent. Thanks, Mr.Rearden, and so
long— we'llmeet againmuch sooner than lhadhope#.”
Hewasgone before Rearden could answer. Hevanished beyond
thestone fence, asabruptly andsoundlessly ashehadcome. When
53a
Reardon turned tolook through thefarm field, there wasnotrace
ofhimandnosignofmovement anywhere inthedarkness.
Rearden stood ontheedge ofanempty road inaspread ofloneli-
ness vaster than ithadseemed before. Then hesaw, lying athisfeet,
anobject wrapped inburlap, withonecomet exposed andglistening
mthemoonlight, thecolor ofthepirate's hair.Hebent, picked it
upandwalked on.

KipChalmers swore asthetrain lurched and spilled hiscocktail
over thetable top.Heslumped forward, hiselbow inthepuddle,
and said:
“Goddamn these railroads! What's thematter with their track?
You'd think with allthemoney they’ve gotthey'd disgorge alittle,
sowewouldn't have tobump likefarmers onahaycart!"
Histhree companions didnottake thetrouble toanswer. Itwas
late,andtheyremained inthelounge merely because aneffort was
needed toretire totheir compartments. The lights ofthelounge
looked likefeeble portholes inatogofcigarette smoke dank with
theodor otalcohol. Itwasaprivate car.which Chalmers hadde-
manded andobtained forhisjourney; itwasattached totheendof
theComet and itswung like the tailofanervous animal asthe
Comet coiled through thecurves ofthemountains.
‘Tm going tocampaign forthenationalization oftherailroads."
saidKip Chalmers, glaring defiantly atasmall, graymanwholooked
athimwithout interest. “That's going tobemyplatform plank. I've
gottohave aplatform plank. Idon't likeJimTaggart. Helooks
likeasoft-boiled clam.Tohellwith therailroads! It'stimewetook
them over."
“Go tobed." said theman, “ifyouexpect tolook likeanything
human atthebigrallytomorrow."
“Doyouthink we’llmake it?"
“You’ve gottomake it."
“Iknow l'\egot to.But Idon’t think we’ll getthere ontime.
Thisgoddamn snail ofasuper-special ishours late."
“You've gottobethere, Kip." said themanominously, inthat
stubborn monotone oftheunthinking which asserts anendwithout
concern forthemeans.
“Goddamn you,don't yousuppose 1know it?"
KipChalmers hadcurly blond hairand ashapeless mouth. He
camefrom asemi-wealthy, serra-distinguished family, buthesneered
atwealth and distinction inamanner which implied thatonly a
lop-rank aristocrat could permit himself such adegree ofcynical
indifference. Hehadgtaduated from acollege which specialized in
breeding thatkind ofaristocracy. The college hadtaught him that
thepurpose ofideas istofoolthosewho arestupid enough tothink.
Hehadmade hisway inWashington with thegrace ofacat-burglar,
climbing from bureau tobureau asfrom ledge toledge ofacrum-
bling structure. Hewasranked assemi-powerful, but hismanner
made laymen mistake him fornothing lessthanWesley Mouch.
Forreasons ofhisown particular strategy. KipChalmers hadde-
cided toenter popular politics andtorunforelection asLegislator
539
from California, though heknew nothing about that state except the
movie industry andthebeach clubs. Hiscampaign manager haddone
thepreliminary work, andChalmers wasnowonhisway toface his'
future constituents forthe firsttime atanoverpublicized rally inSan
Francisco tomorrow night. Themanager hadwanted him tostarta
dayearlier, butChalmers hadstayed inWashington toattend acock-
tailparty andhadtaken the last train possible. Hehadshown no
concern about therally until thisevening, when henoticed thatthe
Comet wasrunning sixhours late.
Histhreecompanions didnotmind hismood: they liked hisliquor.
Lester Tuck, hiscampaign manager, wasasmall, agingman with a
face thatlooked asifithadoncebeenpunched inandhadnever
rebounded. Hewasanattorney who,some generations earlier, would
have represented shoplifters andpeople who stage accidents onthe
premises ofrichcorporations; nowhefound thathecould dobetter
byrepresenting men likeKipChalmers.
Laura Bradford wasChalmers’ current mistress: heliked herbe-
cause hispredecessor hadbeen Wesley Mouch. Shewasamovie
actress whohadforced herwayfromcompetent featured player to
incompetent star, notbymeans ofsleeping with studio executives,
butbytaking thelong-distance short cutofsleeping with bureau-
crats. Shetalked economics, instead ofglamour, forpress interviews,
inthebelligerently righteous style ofathird-rate tabloid: hereco-
nomics consisted oftheassertion that"we’ve gottohelp thepoor."
Gilbert Keith-Worthing wasChalmers’ guest, fornoreason that
either ofthem could discover. Hewas aBritish novelist ofworld
fame,whohadbeen populai thirty years ago; since then, nobody
bothered toreadwhat hewrote, buteverybody accepted him asa
walking classic. Hehadbeen considered profound foruttering such
things as:"Freedom? Do let’sstop talking about freedom. Freedom
isimpossible. Mancannever befreeofhunger, ofcold, ofdisease,
ofphysical accidents. Hecannever befreeofthetyranny ofnature.
Sowhyshould heobject tothetyranny ofapolitical dictatorship?"
When allofEurope put into practice theideas which hehad
preached, hecame tolive inAmerica. Through theyears, hisstyle
ofwriting and hisbody hadgrown flabby. Atseventy, hewasan
obese oldmanwithretouched hairandamanner ofscornful cynicism
retouched byquotations from theyogis about the futility ofall
human endeavor. KipChalmers hadinvited him.because itseemed
tolook distinguished. Gilbert Keith-Worthing hadcome along, be-
cause hehadnoparticular place togo.
“Goddamn these railroad people!” saidKipChalmers. "They’re
doing itonpurpose. They want toruinmycampaign. 1can’t miss
that rally! ForChrist’s sake, Lester, dosomething!”
"I’ve tried,” said Lester Tuck. Atthetrain’s lastslop, hehad
tried, bylong-distance telephone, tofind airtranspoi’talion tocom-
plete their journey; butthere werenocommercial flights scheduled
forthenexttwodays.
"Ifthey don’t getmethereontime, I’llhave their $calps andtheir
railroad! Can’twetellthatdamn conductor tohurry^”
“You’ve toldhimthree times.”

‘Tilgethim fired. He’s givenmenothing butalotofalibis about
alltheirmessy technical troubles. Iexpect transportation, not alibis.
They can’t treatmelikeoneoftheirday-coach passengers. Iexpect
them togetmewhere Iwant togowhen Iwant it.Don’t theyknow
thatI’monthistrain?”
“They know itbynow,” saidLaura Bradford. “Shut up,Kip.You
boreme.”
Chalmers refilled hisglass.Thecarwasrocking andtheglassware
tinkled faintly ontheshelves ofthebar.Thepatches ofstarlit sky
inthewindows keptswaying jerkily, and itseemed asifthestars
were tinkling against oneanother. They could seenothing beyond
theglassbayoftheobservation window attheendofthecar,except
thesmall halos ofredandgreen lanterns marking therearofthe
train, andabrief stretch ofrailrunning away fromthem intothe
darkness. Awallofrockwasracing thetrain, andthestarsdipped
occasionally intoasudden break thatoutlined, highabove them, the
peaks ofthemountains ofColorado.
“Mountains . ..”saidGilbert Keith-Worthing, with satisfaction.
“It isaspectacle ofthiskind thatmakes one feeltheinsignificance
ofman.What isthispresumptuous little bitofrail,which crude
materialists aresoproud ofbuilding-compared tothateternal gran-
deur?Nomore than thebasting thread ofaseamstress onthehem
ofthegarment ofnature. Ifasingle oneofIhosc granite giants chose
tocrumble, itwould annihilate this train”
“Why should itchoose tocrumble?” asked Laura Bradford, with-
outanyparticular interest.
“Ithink thisdamn train isgoing slower,” saidKipChalmers.
“Those bastards areslowing down, inspite ofwhat 1toldthem!”
“Well .. .it'sthemountains, youknow . .saidLester Tuck.
‘Mountains bedamned! Lester, whatday isthis?With ailthose
damn changes oftime, lcan't tellwhich—”
“It'sMaytwenty-seventh,” sighed Lester Tuck.
“It’sMay twenty-eighth,” said Gilbert Keith-Worthing, glancing
athiswatch. “It isnowtwelve minutes pastmidnight.”
“Jesus!” cried Chalmers. “Then therally istodavV'
“Yep,” saidLester Tuck.
“Wewon’tmake it!We—”
The traingave asharper lurch, knocking theglass outofhishand.
The thinsound ofitscrash against thefloormixed with thescreech
otthewheel-flanges tearing against the railofasharp curve.
“1say,” asked Gilbert Keith-Worthing nervously, “areyour rail-
roads safe?”
“Hell, yes!” saidKipChalmers “We’ve gotsomany rules, regula-
tions and controls that those bastards wouldn’t dare nottobe

“There won't beanystop tillSailLake City.”
“Imean, what’s thenext station?”
Lester luckproduced asoiled map,which hehadbeen consulting
every fewminutes since nightfall. “Winston,” hesaid. “Winston,
(dorado.”
KipChalmers reached foranother glass.

“Tinky Holloway said thatWesley said that ifyoudon’t winthis
election* you're through*” saidLaura Bradford, She satsprawled in.
herchair, looking pastChalmers, studying herown face inamirror
onthewallofthelounge; shewasbored and itamused hertoneedle
hisimpotent anger.
“Oh, bedid,didhe?”
“Uh-huh. Wesley doesn't want what’s-hjs-name —whoever’s run-
ning against you—togetintotheLegislature. Ifyoudon’t win,Wes-
leywillbesore ashell.Tinky said—”
“Damn thatbastard! He’d better watch hisownneck!”
“Oh, Idon’t know. Wesley tikeshimverymuch.” Sheadded,
“Tinky Holloway wouldn’t allowsome miserable train tomake him
missanimportant meeting. They wouldn’t dare toholdhimup.”
KipChalmers satstaring athisglass. “I'm going tohave thegov-
ernment sebe alltherailroads,” hesaid, hisvoice low.
“Really,” said Gilbert Keith-Worthing, “1don't seewhyyou
haven't done itlong ago.This istheonlycountry onearth backward
enough topermit private ownership ofrailroads.”
“Well, we’re catching upwithyou,” saidKipChalmers.
“Your country issoincredibly naive. It'ssuch ananachronism
Allthat talkabout liberty andhuman rights—Ihaven’t heard itsince
thedaysofmygreat-grandfather. It’snothing butaverbal luxury ofthe
rich.After all, itdoesn’t make anydifference tothepoorwhether their
livelihood isatthemercy ofanindustrialist orabureaucrat.”
“The dayoftheindustrialists isover. This isthedayof—”
The jolt feltasifthe airwithin thecarsmashed them forward
while thefloor stopped under their feet.KipChalmers was flung
down tothecarpet. Gilbert Keith-Worthing wasthrown across the
tabletop, thefights were blasted out.Glasses crashed offtheshelves
thesteel ofthewalls screamed asifabout toripopen while along,
distant thudwent likeaconvulsion through thewheels ofthetrain
When heraised hishead, Chalmers sawthat thecarstood intact
and stilj;heheard themoans ofhiscompanions andthe firstshriek
ofLaura Bradford’s hysterics. Hecrawled along thefloor tothe
doorway, wrenched itopen, andtumbled down thesteps. Farahead,
onthesideofacurve, hesawmoving flashlights andaredglow ai
aspotwhere theengine hadnoplace tobe.Hestumbled through
thedarkness, bumping intohalf-clothed figures thatwaved thefutile
little flares ofmatches. Somewhere along the line,hesaw aman
withaflashlight andseized hisarm. Itwastheconductor.
“What happened?” gasped Chalmers.
“Split rail,” theconductor answered impassively. “The engine
went offthetrack.”
“Off ...?”
“On itsside.”
“Anybody ...killed?”
“No.Theengineer’s allright.Thefireman ishurt.*’
“Split rail?What doyoumean, split rail?”
Theconductor’s facehadanoddlook; itwas griift, accusing and
closed. “Rail wears out,Mr.Chalmers,” heanswered with astrange
kind ofemphasis. “Particularly oncurves.”
542
“Didn't youknow that itwasworn out?”
vkWeknew.”
“Well, why didn’t youhave itreplaced?”
“Itwasgoing tobereplaced. ButMr.Locey cancelled that?’
“Who isMrLoccy?”
“Themanwho isnowourOperating Vice-President.”
Chalmers wondered why theconductor seemed tolook athimas
ifsomething about thecatastrophe were hisfault. “Well . . .well,
aren’t yougoing toputtheengine backonthetrack?”
“That engine's never going tobeputbackonanytrack, from the
looks of it.'*
“But . . .it’sgottomove us!”
“Hcan’t”
Beyond thefewmoving flares andthedulled sounds ofscreams;
Chalmers sensed suddenly, notwanting tolook atit,theblack im-
mensity ofthemountains, thesilence ofhundred* olunmhabited
miles, andtheprecarious strip olaledge hanging between awallof
rockandanabyss.Hegripped theconductor's arm tighter.
‘But .butwhat arewegoing todo'*”
“The engineer's gone tocallWinston."
“Call?How?"
“There’s aphone couple ofmilesdown thetrack.”
“Will they getusoutofhere?”
“They will.”
“But .Then hismindmade aconnection with thepastand
thefuture, and hisvoice rose toascream forthe flrsttime:“How
long willwehave towait?"
“1don’t know,” saidtheconductor. Hethrew Chalmers' hand olf
hisarm,andwalked away.
Thenight operator atWinston Station listened tothephone mes-
sage.dropped thereceiver andraced upthestairs toshake thesta-
tionagent outofbed.The station agent wasahusky, surly drifter
whohadbeen assigned tothejobtendays ago,byorder ofthenew
division superintendent. Hestumbled dazedly tohisfeet,buthewas
knocked awake when theoperator's words reached hisbrain.
“What?" hegasped. “Jesus! TheComet? ,. .Well, don’t stand
there shaking! Cali Silver Springs!”
The night dispatcher oftheDivision Headquarters atSilver
Springs listened tothemessage, thentelephoned Dave Mitch urn.the
newsuperintendent oftheColorado Division.
“TheComet?” gasped Mitchum, hishand pressing thetelephone
kceiver tohisear,hisfeethitting thefloorandthrowing himupright,
outofbed,“The engine done for?The Diesel ?”
“Yes, sir.*’
"OhGod! Oh,GodAlmighty! What arewegoing todo?" Then,
remembering hisposition, headded, “Well, send outthewrecking
train.”
“Ihave,”
“Cali theoperator atSherwood tohold alltraffic.”
*ihave.”
“What haveyougotonthesheet?”
543
‘"TheArray Freight Special, westbound. But it’snotdueforabout
four hours. It’srunning late.”
“I’llberightdown. .. .Wait, listen, getBill,Sandy andClarence
down bythetime Igetthere. There’s going tobehelltopay!”
Dave Mitchum hadalways complained about injustice, because,
hesaid, hehadalways hadbad luck.Heexplained itbyspeaking
darkly about theconspiracy ofthebigfellows, whowould never give
himachance, though hedidnotexplain justwhom hemeant by
“the bigfellows.” Seniority ofservice was hisfavorite topic ofcom-
plaint andsolestandard ofvalue; hehadbeen intherailroad busi-
nesslonger thanmanymenwhohadadvanced beyond him; this,he
said,wasproof ofthesocial system's injustice—though henever
explained justwhat hemeant by“the social system.” Hehadworked
formany railroads, buthadnotstayed long withanyoneofthem.
Hisemployers hadhadnospecific misdeeds tocharge against him,
buthadsimply eased him out,because hesaid,“Nobody toldme
to!”toooften.Hedidnotknow thatheowed hispresent jobtoa
dealbetween James Taggart andWesley Mouch: when Taggart
traded toMouch thesecret ofhissister’s private life, inexchange
foraraise inrates,Mouch made himthrow inanextra favor, by
theircustomary rules ofbargaining, which consisted ofsqueezing all
onecould outofanygiven trade. The extra wasajobforDave
Mitchum, whowasthebrother-in-law ofClaude Slagenhop, whowas
thepresident oftheFriends ofGlobal Progress, whowere regarded
byMouch asavaluable influence onpublic opinion. James Taggart
pushed theresponsibility offinding ajobforMitchum onto Clifton
Locey. Loccy pushed Mitchum into the firstjobthatcame up—
superintendent oftheColorado Division-— when themanholding it
quitwithout notice. Theman quitwhen theextra Diesel engine of
Winston Station wasgiven toChick Morrison’s Special.
“What arewegoing todo?” criedDave Mitchum, rushing, half-
dressed andgroggy with sleep, into hisoffice, where thechief dis-
patcher, thetrainmaster andtheroadforeman ofengines were waiting
forhim.
Thethreemen didnotanswer. They were middle-aged menwith
years ofrailroad service behind them.Amonth ago, theywould
havevolunteered their advice inanyemergency; buttheywere begin-
ning tolearn that things hadchanged and that itwasdangerous
tospeak.
“What inhellarewegoing todo?”
“One thing iscertain,” said BillBrent, thechief dispatcher. “We
can’tsend atrain intothetunnel with acoal-burning engine.”
Dave Mitchum’s eyesgrew sullen: heknew that thiswastheone
thought onalltheir minds; hewished Brent hadnotgamed it.
“Well, where dowegetaDiesel?” heasked angrily.
“We don’t,” saidtheroad foreman.
\
“Butwecan’tkeep theComet waiting onasiding ^11night!”
“Looks likewe’llhave to,”saidthetrainmaster. “What’s tbeuse
oftalking about it,Dave? Youknow thatthere isnbDiesel any-
where onthedivision.”
544
“But Christ Almighty, howdotheyexpect ustomove trains with-
outengines?”
“Miss Taggart didn’t,” saidtheroad foreman. “Mr.Locey does.”
“Bill,” asked Mitchum, inthetone ofpleading forafavor, “isn't
there anything transcontinental that’s due tonight, withanysortof
aDiesel?”
“The firstonetocome,” said BillBrent implacably, “will beNum-
ber236,thefastfreight fromSanFrancisco, which isdue atWinston
atseven-eighteen am"Headded, “That’s theDiesel closest tous
atthismoment. I’vechecked.”
“What about theArmy Special?”
“Better notthink about it,Dave. Thatonehaspriority over every-
thing onthe line, including theComet, byorder oftheArmy,
They’re running lateasitis—journal boxes caught firetwice. They’re
carrying munitions fortheWest Coast arsenals. Better pray that
nothing stopsthemonyour division. Ifyouthink we’ll catch hellfor
holding theComet, it’snothing towhat we’ll catch ifwetrytostop
thatSpecial.”
They remained silent. Thewindows wereopen tothesummer night
andtheycould hear theringing ofthetelephone inthedispatcher’s
office downstairs. 'Hie signal lights winked over thedeserted yards that
hadoncebeen abusy division point.
Mitchum looked toward theroundhouse; where theblack silhou-
ettes ofafewsteam engines stood outlined madim light.
“The tunnel—”hesaidandstopped.
“—is eight miles long,” saidthetrainmaster, with aharsh emphasis,
“Iwasonly thinking,” snapped Mitchum.
“Better notthink ofit,”saidBrent softly.
“Ihaven’t saidanything!”
“What wasthat talkyouhadwithDickHorton before hequit?”
theroadforeman asked t<x>innocently, asifthesubject were irrele-
vant.“Wasn’t itsomething about theventilation system ofthetunnel
being onthebum? Didn't hesaythat thetunnel washardly safe
nowadays even forDiesel engines?”
“Why doyoubring thatup?” snapped Mitchum. “Ihaven’t said
anything!” Dick Horton, thedivision chief engineer, hadquitthree
days afterMitchum’s arrival.
“Ithought I’djustmention it,”theroad foreman answered
innocently.
“Look, Dave,” said BillBrent, knowing thatMitchum would stall
foranother hour rather than formulate adecision, “youknow that
there's onlyonething todo:holdtheComet atWinston tillmorning,
wait forNumber 236,have herDiesel take theComet through the
tunnel, then lettheComet finish herrunwith thebestcoal-burner
wecangiveherontheother side.”
“Buthow late willthatmake her?”
Brent shrugged. “Twelve hours—eighteen hours—whoknows?”
“Eighteen hours— fortheComet? Christ, that’s never happened
before!”
“None ofwhat’s beenhappening toushaseverhappened before,”
545
saidBrent, withanastonishing sound ofweariness inhisbrisk, com-
petent voice.
"’But they’ll blame usfor itinNewYork! They’ll put alltheblame
onus!”
Brent shrugged. Amonth ago,hewould have considered suchan
injustice inconceivable; today, heknew belter.
“Iguess . .saidMitchum miserably, “Iguess there’s nothing
else thatwecando.”
“There isn't, Dave.”
“OhGod!Why didthishave tohappen tous?”
“Who isJohn Galt?”
Itwas half-past twowhen theCoirnt, pulled byanoldswitch
engine, jerked toastoponasiding ofWinston Station. KipChalmers
glanced outwithincredulous anger atthefewshanties onadesolate
mountainside and attheancient hovel ofastation.
“Now what? What inhellaretheystopping here for?” hecried,
andrang fortheconductor
With thereturn ofmotion and safety, histerror hadturned into
rage.Hefeltalmost asifhehadbeen cheated bvhaving beenmade
toexperience anunnecessary fear.Hiscompanions were stillclinging
tothetables ofthelounge; they felttooshaken tosleep.
“How long?” theconductor said impassively, inanswer tohis
question. “Tillmorning, Mr.Chalmers.”
Chalmers stared athim, stupefied. “We're going tostand here
fillmorning?”
“Yes, Mr.Chalmers.”
’Here?'"
“Yes.”
“But 1have arally inSanFrancisco intheevening!”
Theconductor didnotanswer.
“Why? Whydowehave tostand?Why inhell?What happened7”
Slowly, patiently, withcontemptuous politeness, theconductor
gavehim.anexact account ofthesituation. Butyears ago, ingram-
marschool, inhigh school, incollege. KipChalmers hadbeen taught
thatmandoes notandneed not livebyreason.
“Damn your tunnel!” hescreamed. “Doyouthink I’mgoing to
letyouholdmeupbecause ofsome miserable tunnel? Doyouwant
towreck vital national plansonaccount ofatunnel? Tellyour engi-
neer that lmust beinSanFrancisco byevening andthat he's got
togetmethere!”
“How?”
“That’s your job,notmine!”
“There isnoway todoit.”
“Then findaway,Goddamn you!”
Theconductor didnotanswer.
“Doyouthink I’llletyour miserable technological problems inter-
ferewith crucial social issues? Doyouknowwho Jajm? Tell that
engineer tostartmoving, ifhevalues hisjob!”
“The engineer hashisorders.”
“Orders bedamned! /givetheorders these days!Telhimtostart
atonce!”
546
“Perhaps you’d better speak tothestation agent, Mr.Chalmers.
Ihavenoauthority toanswer youasI’dliketo,”saidtheconductor,
andwalked out.
Chalmers leaped tohisfeet. “Say, Kip . . said Lester Tuck
uneasily, “maybe it’strue . . .maybe they can’tdoit.”
“They can iftheyhave to!”snapped Chalmers, marching reso-
lutely tothedoor.
Years ago, incollege, hehadbeen taught that theonly effective
means toimpelmen toaction was fear.
Inthedilapidated office ofWinston Station, heconfronted asleepy
manwith slack, worn features, andafrightened young boywho sat
attheoperator’s desk.They listened, insilent stupor, toastream of
profanity such astheyhadnever heard from anysection gang.
“—and it’snotmyproblem howyou getthetrain through the
tunnel, that’s foryou tofigure out!” Chalmers concluded. “But if
youdon’t getmeanengine anddon’t start that train, youcankiss
goodbye toyour jobs, yourwork permits and thiswhole goddamn
railroad!”
Hiestation agent hadnever heard ofKipChalmers anddidnot
know thenature ofhisposition. Butheknew that thiswastheday
whenunknown men inundefined positions held unlimited power—
thepower oflifeordeath.
“It’s notuptous,Mr.Chalmers,” hesaid pleadingly. “We don’t
issue theorders outhere.Theorder came from Silver Springs. Sup-
poseyoutelephone Mr.Mitchum and—”
“Who’s Mr.Mitchum?”
“He’s thedivision supeiintendent atSilver Springs. Suppose you
sendhim amessage to—”
“Ishould bother with adivision superintendent! Tlisend ames-
sage toJimTaggart—that’s whatTmgoing todo!”
Before thestation agent hadtime torecover, Chalmers whirled to
theboy, ordering, “You—take thisdown andsend itatonce!”
Itwasamessage which, amonth ago,thestation agent would not
have accepted from anypassenger; therules forbade it;buthewas
notcertain about anyrules anylonger.
Mr.James Taggart, NewYork City,AmheldupontheComet at
Winston, Colorado, bytheincompetence ofyourmen,who refuse
togivemeanengine. Have meeting inSanFrancisco intheevening
oftop-level national importance. Ifyoudon’tmovemytrain atonce,
I'llletyouguess theconsequences.
KipChalmers.
After theboyhadtransmitted thewords onto thewires that
stretched from pole topole across acontinent asguardians ofthe
Taggart track— afterKipChalmers hadreturned tohiscartowait
torananswer—thestation agent telephoned Dave Mitchum, who
was hisfriend, andread tohimthetextofthemessage. Heheard
Mitchum groan inanswer.
“Ithought I’dtellyou,Dave. Inever heard oftheguybefore, but
maybe he’ssomebody important.”
“I'don’t know!” moaned Mitchum. "Kip Chalmers? Youseehis
name inthenewspapers allthetime, right inwith allthetop-level
547
boys. 1don’tknow whatheis,but ifhe’sfrom Washington, wecan’t
takeanychances. OhChrist, what arewegoing todo?”
Wecan’t takeanychances—thought theTaggart operator inNew
York, andtransmitted themessage bytelephone toJames Taggart’s
home. Itwasclose tosixam.inNewYork, andJames Taggart was
awakened outofthe fitful sleep ofarestless night.Helistened to
thetelephone, hisface sagging. He feltthesame fearasthestation
agent ofWinston, andforthesame reason.
Hecalled thehome ofClifton Locey. Alltheragewhich hecould
notpourupon KipChalmers, waspoured over thetelephone wire
upon Clifton Locey. “Do something!” screamed Taggart. “Idon't
carewhatyoudo, it’syour job,notmine, butseetoitthatthat train
getsthrough! What inhell isgoing on? Inever heard oftheComet
being held up! Isthathowyourunyourdepartment? It’safine
thingwhen important passengers have tostart sending messages to
me\Atleast,whenmysister rantheplace, Iwasn’t awakened inthe
middle ofthenight overevery spike thatbroke inIowa—Colorado, I
mean!”
“Tin sosorry. Jim," said Clifton Locey smoothly, inatone that
balanced apology, reassurance and theright degree otpatronizing
confidence. “It’s justamisunderstanding. It’ssomebody’s stupid mis-
take. Don’t worry. I’lltake care ofit. Iwas, asamatter offact, in
bed,butTHattend toitatonce.”
Clifton Loccy wasnotinbed;hehad justreturned from around
ofnight clubs, inthecompany ofayoung lady.Heasked hertowait
andhurried totheoffices ofTaggart Transcontinental. None ofthe
night staffwhosawhimthere could saywhyhechose toappear in
person, butneither could they saythat ithadbeen unnecessary. He
rushed inandoutofseveral offices, wasseenbymany people and
gaveanimpression ofgreat activity. Theonly physical result of it
wasanorder thatwentover thewires toDave Mitchum, superinten-
dent oftheColorado Division:
“Give anengine toMr.Chalmers atonce.Send theComet through
safely andwithout unnecessary delay Ifyouareunable toperform
your duties, Ishall holdyou responsible before theUnification
Board. Clifton Locey.”
Then, calling hisgirlfriend tojoinhim, Clifton Locey drove toa
country roadhouse—tomake certain thatnoonewould beable to
findhim inthenextfewhours.
Thedispatcher atSilver Springs wasbaffled bytheorder thathe
handed toDave Milchum, butDaveMitchum undeistood. Heknew
thatnorailroad order would everspeak insuchterms asgiving an
engine toapassenger, heknew thatthething wasashow piece, he
guessed what sortofshowwasbeing staged, andhefelt$coldsweat
attherealization ofwhowasbeing framed asthegoat theshow.
“What’s thematter, Dave?” asked thetrainmaster.
Mitchum didnotanswer. Heseized thetelephone, hishands shak-
ingashebegged foraconnection totheTaggart operator mNew
York.Helooked likeananimal inatrap.
Hebegged theNewYork operator togethimMr.Clifton Locey’s
home. Theoperator tried. There wasnoanswer. Hebegged the
548
operator tokeepontrying andtotryeverynumber hecould think
of,where Mr.Locey might befound. Theoperator promised and
Mitchum hung up,butknew that itwasuseless towaitortospeak
toanyone inMr.Locey's department,
“What’s thematter, Dave?”
Mitchum handed himtheorder—and sawbythelookonthetrain-
master’s face thatthetrapwasasbadashehadsuspected.
Hecalled theRegion Headquarters ofTaggart Transcontinental
atOmaha, Nebraska, andbegged tospeak tothegeneral manager
oftheregion. There wasabrief silence onthewire, then thevoice
oftheOmaha operator toldhim that thegeneral manager had re-
signed andvanished three daysago—“over alittle trouble withMr.
Locey*” thevoice added.
Heasked tospeak totheassistant general manager incharge of
hisparticular district; buttheassistant wasoutoftown fortheweek
endandcould notbereached.
“Getmesomebody else!'' Mitchum screamed. “Anybody, ofany
district! For Christ’s sake, getmesomebody who’ll tel!mewhat
todo!”
Themanwhocameonthewirewastheassistant general manager
oltheIowa-Minnesota District.
“What?” heinterrupted atMitchum’s firstwords. “AtWinston,
Colorado? Why inhellarcyou calling me? . ..No,don't tellme
whathappened, Idon't want toknow it! ., .No. 1said!No!You’re
notgoing toframemeintohaving toexplain afterwards why Idid
ordidn’t doanything about whatever itis.It'snotmyproblem! . ..
Speak tosome region executive, don’t pickonme,whatdo 1have
todowith Colorado** ...Ohhell, 1don’t know, getthechief engi-
neer, speak tohim!”
Ihechief engineer oftheCentral Region answered impatiently,
“Yes? What? What isit?”andMitchum rushed desperately toex-
plain.When thechief engineer heard that there wasnoDiesel, he
snapped, “Then hold the train, ofcourse!” When heheard about
Mr.Chalmers, hesaid, hisvoice suddenly subdued. “Hm , .,Kip
Chalmers? OfWashington? . . .Well, Idon’t know. Thatwould be
amatter forMr.Locey todecide.” When Mitchum said,“Mr.Locey
oidered metoarrange it,but—” thechief engineer snapped ingreat
relief, “Then doexactly asMr.Locey says!” andhung up.
DaveMitchum replaced thetelephone receiver cautiously. Hedid
notscream anylonger. Instead, hetiptoed toachair, almost asifhe
were sneaking. Hesatlooking atMr.Locey’s order foralong time.
Then hesnatched aglance about theroom. Thedispatcher was
busy athistelephone. Thetrainmaster andtheroadforeman were
there, buttheypretended thattheywere notwaiting. Hewished Bill
Brent, thechief dispatcher, would gohome; BillBrent stood ina
corner, watching him.
Brent wasashort, thinman withbroad shoulders; hewas forty,
hutlooked younger; hehadthepale face ofanoffice worker and
thehard, lean features ofacowboy. Hewasthebestdispatcher on
thesystem.
549
Mitchum roseabruptly andwalked upstairs tohisoffice, clutching
Locey *sorder inhishand.
Dave Mitchuin wasnotgood atunderstanding problems ofengi-
neering and transportation, butheunderstood men like Cliiton
Locey. Heunderstood thekind ofgame theNewYork executives
were playing andwhaf theywere now'doing tohim.Theorder did
not tellhimtogiveMr.Chalmers acoal-burning engine— just“an
engine.” Ifthetimecame toanswer questions, wouldn't Mr.Locey
gasp inshocked indignation thathehadexpected adivision superin-
tendent toknow thatonly aDiesel engine could bemeant inthat
order? llicorder stated thathewas tosend theComet through
"safely”—wasn’t adivision superintendent expected toknow what
wassafe?—‘
vandwithout unnecessary delay.” What wasanunneces-
sary delay? Ifthe possibility ofamajor disaster was involved,
wouldn't adelay ofaweek oramonth boconsidered necessary?
TheNewYork executives didnotcare, thought Mitchum; they
didnotcarewhether Mr.Chalmers reached hismeeting ontime, or
whether anunprecedented catastrophe struck their rails; theycared
onlyabout making sure thattheywould notbeblamed foreither.
Ifheheld thetrain, theywould make himthescapegoat toappease
theanger ofMr.Chalmers: ifhesent thetram through and itdid
notreach thewestern portal ofthetunnel, theywould puttheblame
onhisincompetence; theywould claim thathehadacted against
their orders, ineither case.What would hebeable toprove? To
whom? One could prove nothing toatribunal thathadnostaled
policy, nodefined procedure, norules ofevidence, nobinding princi-
ples—atribunal, such astheUnification Board, thatpronounced men
guilty orinnocent asitsaw fit.withnostandard ofguilt orinnocence.
DaveMitchum knew nothing about thephilosoph> oflaw;buthe
knew thatwhen acourt isnotbound byany rules, itisnotbound
byany facts, andthen ahearing isnotanissue ofjustice, butan
issue ofmen,andyour fatedepends notonwhatyouhave orhave
notdone/ butonwhom youdoordonotknow Heasked himself
what chance hewould have atsuch ahearing against Mr.James
Taggart, Mr.Clifton Locey, Mr.KipChalmers and their powerful
friends,
DaveMitchum hadspent hislifeslipping around thenecessity of
evermaking adecision; hehaddone itbywaiting tobetoldand
never being certain ofanything. Allthathenowallowed into his
brainwasalong, indignant whine against injustice. Fate,hethought,
hadsingled himoutforanunfair amount ofbad luck: hewasbeing
framed byhissuperiors ontheonlygood job.hehadever held.He
hadnever been taught tounderstand that themanner inwhich he
obtained thisjob,andtheframe-up, were inextricably parts ofa
single whole.
Ashelooked atLocey's order, hethought thathecduid hold the
Comet; attach Mr.Chalmers’ cartoanengine and setfd itinto the
tunnel, alone. Butheshook hishead before thethought was full)
formed; heknew that thiswould force Mr.Chalmers ;torecognize
thenature oftherisk:Mr.Chalmers would refuse; hewould continue
todemand asafeandnon-existent engine. And more: thiscould
550
mean that he,Mitchum, would have toassume responsibility, admit
fullknowledge ofthedanger, stand intheopen and identify the
exact nature ofthesituation—theone actwhich thepolicy ofhis
superiors wasbased onevading, theonekeytotheirgame.
DaveMitchum wasnottheman torebel against hisbackground
ortoquestion themoral code ofthose incharge. Thechoice he
made wasnottochallenge, buttofollow thepolicy ofhissuperiors.
BillBrent could have beaten him inanycontest oftechnology, but
herewasanendeavor atwhich hecould beat BillBrent without
effort. There hadoncebeen asociety wheremenneeded theparticu-
lartalents ofBillBrent, iftheywished tosurvive; what theyneeded
nowwasthetalent ofDave Mitchum.
Dave Mitchum satdown athissecretary’s typewriter and,by
means oftwofingers, carefully typed outanorder tothetrainmaster
andanother totheroadforeman. The firstinstructed thetrainmaster
tosummon alocomotive crew atonce, torapurpose described only
as“anemergency”; thesecond instructed theroadforeman to“send
thebestengine available toWinston, tostand byforemergency
assistance.”
Heputcarbon copies oftheorders into hisown pocket, then
opened thedoor, yelled forthenight dispatcher tocome upand
handed himthetwoorders forthetwomen downstairs. The night
dispatcher wasaconscientious young boywho trusted hissuperiors
andknew that discipline wasthe first ruleoftherailroad business.
Hewasastonished thatMitchum should wish tosend written orders
down one flight ofstairs, butheasked noquestions.
Mitchum waited nervously. After awhile, hesawthefigure ofthe
roadforeman walking across theyards toward theroundhouse. He
fellrelieved: thetwomenhadnotcome uptoconfront him inper-
son;theyhadunderstood andtheywould play thegame ashewas
playing it.
Theroadforeman walked across theyards, looking down atthe
ground. Hewasthinking ofhiswife, histwochildren andthehouse
which hehadspent alifetime toown.Heknew what hissuperiors
weredoing andhewondered whether heshould refuse toobey them.
Hehadnever been afraid oflosing hisjob;with theconfidence ofa
competent man, hehadknown that ifhequarreled withoneem-
ployer, hewould always beable tofindanother. Now, bewasafraid;
hehadnoright toquitortoseek ajob; ifhedefied anemployer,
hewould bedelivered into theunanswerable power ofasingle
Board, and iftheBoard ruled against him, itwould mean being
sentenced totheslow death ofstarvation: itwould mean being
barred from anyemployment. Heknew thattheBoard would rule
against him;heknew that thekeytothedark, capricious mystery
oftheBoard’s contradictory decisions wasthesecret power ofpull
What chance would hehave against Mr.Chalmers? There hadbeen
atimewhen theself-interest ofhisemployers haddemanded that
heexercise hisutmost ability. Now, ability wasnotwanted any
longer. There hadbeen atimewhen hehadbeen requited todohis
best'andrewarded accordingly. Now, hecould expect nothing but
punishment, ifhetried tofollow hisconscience. There hadbeen a
551
timewhen hehadbeen expected tothink. Now, they didnotwant
himtothink, only toobey. They didnotwanthim tohave acon-
science anylonger. Thenwhyshould heraise hisvoice? Forwhose
sake?Hethought ofthepassengers—thethree hundred passengers
aboard theComet. Hethought ofhischildren. Hehadasoninhigh
school andadaughter, nineteen, ofwhom hewas fiercely, painfully
proud, because shewasrecognized asthemost beautiful girlintown.
Heasked himself whether hecould deliver hischildren tothefate
ofthechildren oftheunemployed, ashehadseenthem inthe
blighted ateas, inthesettlements around closed factories andalong
thetracks ofdiscontinued railroads. Hesaw, inastonished horror,
thatthechoice which henowhadtomake wasbetween thelives of
hischildren andthelivesofthepassengers ontheComet.Aconflict
ofthiskindhadnever been possible before. Itwasbyprotecting the
safety ofthepassengers thathehadearned thesecurity ofhischil-
dren; hehadserved onebyserving theother; there hadbeenno
clash ofinterests, nocallforvictims Now, ifhewanted tosave the
passengers, hehadtodo itattheprice ofhischildren. Heremem-
bered dimly thesermons hehadheard about thebeauty ofself-
immolation, about thevirtue ofsacrificing toothers thatwhich was
one's dearest. Heknew nothing about thephilosophy ofethics: but
heknew suddenly—notinwords, butintheform ofadark, angry,
savage pain—that ifthiswas virtue, thenhewanted nopartofit.
Hewalked intotheroundhouse andordered alarge, ancient coal-
burning locomotive tobemade ready fortheruntoWinston.
Thetrainmaster reached forthetelephone inthedispatcher’s of-
fice, tosummon anengine crew, asordered. But hishand stopped,
holding thereceiver. Itstruck himsuddenly thathewassummoning
men totheir- death, andthatofthetwenty lives listed onthesheet
before him,twowould beended byhischoice. He feltaphysical
sensation ofcold, nothing more; hefeltnoconcern, only apuzzled,
indifferent astonishment, fthadnever been hisjobtocallmenout
todie:hisjobhadbeen tocallthem outtoearn their living. Itwas
strange, hethought: and itwasstrange that hishand hadstopped;
whatmade itstopwas likesomething hewould have felttwenty
years ago—no,hethought, strange, onlyonemonth ago,notlonger.
Hewasforty-eight years old.Hehadnofamily, nofriends, noties
toanyliving being intheworld. Whatever capacity fordevotion he
hadpossessed, thecapacity which others scatter among many ran-
dom concerns, hehadgiven itwhole totheperson ofhisyoung
brother—thebrother, hisjunior bytwenty -five years,whom hehad
brought up,Hehadsenthimthrough atechnological college, and
hehadknown, ashad alltheteachers, thattheboyhadthemark
ofgenius ontheforehead ofhisgrim, young face. Witfi thesame
single-tracked devotion ashisbrother’s, theboyhad cartijd fornoth-
ingbuthisstudies, notforsports orparties orgirls, qnly forthe
vision ofthethings hewasgoing tocreate asaninven|or. Hehad
graduated from college andhadgone, onasalary unusual forhis
age, into theresearch laboratory ofagreat electrical* concern in
Massachusetts.
ThiswasnowMay 28,thought thetrainmaster. ItwasonMay 1
552
thatDirective 10--289 hadbeen issued. Itwasontheevening ofMay
1thathehadbeeninformed that hisbrother hadcommitted suicide.
Thetrainmaster hadheard itsaid thatthedirective wasnecessary
tosave thecountry. Hecould notknow whether thiswastrueor
not,hehadnoway otknowing whatwasnecessary tosave acountry.
Butdriven bysome feeling which hecould notexpress, hehad
walked intotheoffice oftheeditor ofthelocalnewspaper andde-
manded thatthey publish the story’ ofhisbrother’s death. "‘People
have toknow it,’*hadbeen allhecould giveashisreason. Hehad
been unable toexplain thatthebruised connections ofhismindhad
formed thewordless conclusion that ifthiswasdone bythewillof
thepeople, then thepeople hadtoknow it;hecould notbelieve
thattheywould do it,iftheyknew.The editor hadrefused; hehad
stated that itwould bebad lurthecountry’s morale.
Thetrainmaster knew nothing about political philosophy; buthe
knew that thathadbeen themoment when helost allconcern for
the lifeordeath ofanyhuman being orofthecountry.
Hethought, holding thetelephone receiver, thatmaybe heshould
warn themenwhom hewasabout tocall.They trusted him; itwould
never occur tothem thathecould knowingly sendthem totheir
death. Butheshook hishead: thiswasonly anoldthought, last
year’s thought, aremnant ofthetimewhen hehadtrusted them,
loo Itdidnotmatter now. Hisbrain worked slowly, asifhewere
dragging histhoughts through avacuum where noemotion re-
sponded tospurthem on;hethought thatthere would betrouble if
hewarned anyone, there would besome sortoffightand itwashe
whohad tomake some great effort tostart it.Hehadforgotten
what itwas thatone started this sortoffight for.Truth? Justice?
Brother-love? Hedidnotwant tomake aneftort.Hewasvery tired.
Ifhewarned allthemenonhis list,hethought, there would beno
onetorunthatengine, sohewould savetwo livesandalsothree
hundred Jivesaboard theComet. Butnothing responded tothe fig-
ures inhismind: “lives" was justaword, ithadnomeaning.
Heraised thetelephone receiver tohisear,hecalled twonumbers,
hesummoned anengineer andafireman toreport forduty atonce.
Engine Number 306had leftforWinston, when DaveMitchum
came downstairs. “Get atrackmotor carready forme," heordered,
"Pmgoing torunuptoFairmount." Fairmount wasasmall station,
twenty miles eastontheline.Themennodded, asking noquestions.
BillBrent wasnotamong them. Mitchum walked intoBrent’s office.
Brent wasthere, sitting silently athisdesk; heseemed tobewaiting,
Tmgoing toFairmount,” satdMitchum; hisvoice wasaggres-
sively toocasual, asifimplying thatnoanswer wasnecessary. “They
hadaDiesel there couple ofweeks ago ...youknow, emergency
repairs orsomething, ...I’mgoingdown tosee ifwecould use it."
Hepaused, butBrent saidnothing.’
“Thewaythings stack up,’* saidMitchum, notlooking athim,“we
can’thold that train tillmorning. We’ve gottotake achance, one
wayoranother. Now lthinkmaybe thisDiesel willdo it,butthat’s
thelastonewecantryfor.Soifyoudon’t hearfrommeinhalfan
553
hour, signtheorder andsend theComet through withNumber 306
topullher.”
Whatever Brent hadthought, hecould notbelieve itwhen he
heard it.Hedidnotanswer atonce; thenhesaid,very quietly, “No.”
“Wha*t doyoumean, no?”
“Iwon't doit.”
“What doyoumean, youwon’t? It’sanorder!”
“Iwon’t doit.”Brent’s voice hadthefirmness ofcertainty un-
clouded byanyemotion.
“Areyourefusing toobeyanorder?”
“Iam.”
“But youhave noright torefuse! And I’mnotgoing toargue
about it,either. It’swhat I’vedecided, it’smyresponsibility andI’m
notasking foryour opinion. Your job istotakemyorders.”
“Will yougivemethatorder inwriting?”
“Why, Goddamn you, areyouhinting thatyoudon’t trustme?
Areyou ...?”
“Why doyouhave togotoFairmount. Dave? Why can’tyou
telephone them about theDiesel, ifyouthink thattheyhaveone?”
“You’re notgoing totellmehow todomyjob!You’re notgoing
tositthere andquestion me!You’re going tokeep your trapshut
anddoasyou’re toldorI’llgiveyouachance totalk—totheUnifi-
cation Board!”
Itwashard todecipher emotions onBrent’s cowboy face, but
Mitchum sawsomething thatresembled alookofincredulous horror;
only itwashorror atsome sight ofhisown, notatthewords, and
ithadnoquality offear, notthekindoffearMitchum hadhoped for.
Brent knew thattomorrow morning theissuewould behisword
against Mitchum’s; Mitchum would deny having given theorder; Mil-
chum would show written proof thatEngine Number 306hadbeen
sent toWinston only “tostand by;”andwould produce witnesses
thathehadgone toFairmount insearch ofaDiesel; Mitchum would
claim thatthefatalorder hadbeen issued byandonthesolerespon-
sibility ofBillBrent, thechief dispatcher. Itwould notbemuch of
acase, notacase thatcould bear close study, but itwould beenough
fortheUnification Board, whose policy wasconsistent only innot
permitting anything tobestudied closely. Brent knew thathecould
play thesamegame andpass theframe—upontoanother victim,
heknew thathehadthebrains towork itout—except thathewould
rather bedead thando it.
Itwasnotthesight ofMitchum thatmade him sitstill inhorror.
Itwastherealization thatthere wasnoonewhom hecould call to
expose thisthing andstop it—nosuperior anywhere ,onthe line,
fromColorado toOmaha toNew York. They were in?on it,allof
them, theywere doing thesame, theyhadgiven Mitchum the-4ead
andthemethod. ItwasDave Mitchum whonowbelonged onthis
railroad andhe,BillBrent, whodidnot.
AsBillBrent hadlearned tosee,byasingle gJattce atafew
numbers onasheet ofpaper, theentire trackage ofa]division— so
hewasnowable toseethewhole ofhisown lifeandthefullprice
ofthedecision hewasmaking. Hehadnotfallen in(ove until he

woman hewanted. Hehadbeen engaged toherforthe lastfour
years; hehadhadtowait, because hehadamother tosupport and

bemarried inafewweeks, thiscoming June.Hethought of it,as
hesatathisdesk, looking atDaveMitchum, butthethought aroused
nohesitation, only regret andadistant sadness—distant, because he
knew thathecould not let itbepartofthismoment.
BillBrent knew nothing about epistemology; butheknew that
manmust livebyhisown rational perception ofreality, thathe
cannot actagainst itorescape itorfindasubstitute for it—andthat
there isnootherway forhimtolive.
Herose tohis feet. “It’s true that solong as 1hold thisjob,
Icannot refuse toobey you.’’ hesaid. “But Ican. ifIquit.So
I’mquitting/’
“You’re whatV'
“I’m quitting, asofthismoment.”
“Butyouhavenoright toquit,yougoddamn bastard! Don’t you
know that? Don't youknow that I’llhaveyouthrown injailforit?”
“Ifyouwant tosend thesheriff formeinthemorning. I'llbeat
home. Iwon't try'toescape. There's noplace togo,"
Dave Mitchum wassix-foot-two andhadthebuild ofabruiser,
buthestood shaking with furyandterror over thedelicate figure of
BillBrent. “You can't quit! There’s alawagainst it!I'vegotalaw!
You can’twalk outonme! 1won’t letyouout! Iwon’t letyouleave
thisbuilding tonight!”
Brent walked tothedoor. Willyourepeat thatorder yougave
me, infront oftheothers? No?Then Iwill.”
Ashepulled thedoor open. Mitchum’s listshot out,smashed into
hisfaceandknocked himdown.
Thetrainmaster andtheroadforeman stood intheopen doorway.
“He quit!’screamed Mitchum. “The yellow bastard quit atatime
like this!He’s alaw-breaker and acoward’”
Intheslow effort ofrising from thefloor, through thehaze of
blood running into hiseyes, BillBrent looked upatthetwomen.
Hesaw that they understood, but liesawtheclosed faces ofmen
whodidnotwant tounderstand, didnotwant tointerfere andhated
him forputting them onthespot inthename ofjustice. Hesaid
nothing, rose tohisfeetandwalked outofthebuilding.
Mitchum avoided looking attheothers. “Hey, you.” hecalled,
jerking hishead at,thenight dispatcher across theroom. “Come
here.You’ve gottotakeover atonce,”
.With thedoor closed, herepeated totheboythestory ofthe
Diesel atFairmount, ashehadgiven ittoBrent, andtheorder to
send theComet through withEngine Number 306, iftheboydid
nothearfromhim inhalfanhour.Theboywas innocondition to
think, tospeak ortounderstand anything: hekept seeing theblood
555
onthefaceofBillBrent, whohadbeen hisidol, “Yes, sir/'he
answered numbly.
DaveMitchum departed forFairmount, announcing toevery yard-
man, switchman andwiper insight, asheboarded thetrackmotor
car,thathewasgoing insearch ofaDiesel fortheComet.
The night dispatcher satathisdesk, watching thedock andthe
telephone, praying thatthetelephone would ringand lethimhear
from Mr.Mitchum. Butthehalf-hour went byinsilence, andwhen
there were only three minutes left,theboy feltaterror hecould not
explain, except thathedidnotwant tosend thatorder.
Heturned tothetrainmaster andtheroadforeman, asking hesi-
tantly, “Mr.Mitchum gavemeanorder before heleft,but 1wonder
whether Iought tosend it,because 1... 1don’t think it'sright.He
said—”
Thetrainmaster turned away, hefeltnopity: theboywasabout
thesame ageashisbrother hadbeen.
Theroadforeman snapped, “Do just asMr,Mitchum toldyou.
You're notsupposed tothink," andwalked outoftheroom.
The responsibility thatJames Taggart and Clifton Locey had
evaded nowrested ontheshoulders ofatrembling, bewildered boy.
Hehesitated, thenhebuttressed hiscourage with thethought that
onedidnotdoubt thegood faithandthecompetence ofrailroad
executives. Hedidnotknow that hisvision ofarailroad and its
executives wasthatofacentury ago.
With theconscientious precision ofarailroad man, iitthemoment
when thehand oftheclock ended thehalf-hour, hesigned hisname
totheorder instructing theComet toproceed withEngine Number
306,andtransmitted theorder toWinston Station.
Tlie station agent atWinston shuddered when helooked atthe
order, buthewasnottheman todefy authority Hetold himsell
thatthetunnel was not,perhaps, asdangerous ashethought. He
toldhimself that thebest policy, these days, wasnottothink.
When hehanded their copies oftheorder totheconductor and
theengineer oftheCornet, theconductor glanced slowly about the
room, from face toface, folded the slipofpaper, put itinto his
pocket andwalked outwithout aword.
Theengineer stood looking atthepaper foramoment, thenthrew
itdown and said,“I’m notgoing todo it.And itit’scome towhere
thisrailroad hands outorders like thisone, I’mnotgoing towork
for it,either. Just listmeashaving quit.”
“Butyoucan’t quit!" cried thestation agent, “They'll arrest you
forit!”
“Ifthey findme,” saidtheengineer, andwalked outofthestation
intothevastdarkness ofthemountain night.
Theengineer from Silver Springs, whohadbrought! inNumber
306,was sitting inacorner oftheroom. Hechuckled and said,
“He’s yellow.”
The station agent turned tohim. “Will youdo it,Joe? Willyou
take theComet?”
JoeScottwasdrunk. There hadbeen atimewhen arailroad man,
reporting forduty withanysign ofintoxication, would have been
556
regarded asadoctor arriving forwork with sores ofsmallpox: onhis
face.ButJoeScott wasaprivileged person. Three months ago,he
hadbeen fired foraninfraction ofsafety rules, which hadcaused a
major wreck; twoweeks ago,hehadbeen reinstated inhisjobby
order oftheUnification Board. Hewasafriend ofFredKinnan; he
protected Kinnan’s interests inhisunion, notagainst theemployers,
butagainst themembership.
“Sure,” saidJoeScott. *T11 take theComet. I’llgetherthrough,
if1gofastenough.”
Thefireman ofNumber 306hadremained inthecabofhisengine.
Helooked upuneasily, when theycame toswitch hisengine tothe
headendoftheComet; helooked upattheredandgreen lights of
thetunnel, hanging inthedistance above twenty miles ofcurves.
Buthewasaplacid, amicable fellow, whomade agood fireman with
nohope ofever rising toengineer; hishusky muscles were hisonly
asset.He feltcertain that hissuperiors knew what theywere doing,
sohedidnotventure anyquestions.
Theconductor stood bytherearendoftheComet, fielooked at
thelights ofthetunnel, then atthelong chain oftheComet’s win-
dows.Afewwindows were lighted, butmost ofthemshowed only
thefeeble blueglow ofnight lamps edging thelowered blinds. He
thought thatheshould rouse thepassengers andwarn them. There
hadbeen atimewhen hehadplaced thesafety ofthepassengers
above hisown, notbyreason oflove forhislellow men, butbecause
that responsibility was partofhisjob,which heaccepted and felt
pride infulfilling. Now, hefeltacontemptuous indilference andno
desire tosave them. They hadasked forandaccepted Directive
10--289, hethought, theywent onliving anddaily turning away in
evasion from thekind ofverdicts that theUnification Board was
passing ondefenseless victims—why shouldn’t henow turnaway
fromthem? Ifhesaved their lives, notoneofthem would come
forward todefend himwhen theUnification Board would convict
him fordisobeying orders, forcreating apanic, fordelaying Mr.
Chalmers, Hehadnodesire tobeamartyr forthesake ofallowing
people safely toindulge iniheirown irresponsible evil.
When themoment came, heraised hislantern andsignaled the
engineer tostart,
“See?” saidKipChalmers triumphantly toLester Luck, asthe
wheels under their feetshuddered forward. "Fear istheonly practi-
calmeans todealwith people,”
Theconductor stepped onto thevestibule ofthelastcar.Noone
sawhimashewentdown thesteps oftheother side, slipped offthe
Uainandvanished intothedarkness ofthemountains.
Aswitchman stood ready tothrow theswitch thatwould send the
Comet from thesiding onto themain track.Helooked attheComet
asitcame slowly toward him. Itwasonly ablazing white globe with
abeam stretching highabove hishead, andajerky thunder trembling
through the railunder hisfeet.Heknew thattheswitch should not
hethrown. Hethought ofthenight, tenyears ago,when hehad
risked hislifeinaflood tosave atrainfrom awashout. Butheknew
Ihattimes hadchanged. Inthemoment when hethrew theswitch
557
andsawtheheadlight jerk sidewise, heknew thathewould now
hate hisjobfortherestofhis life.
TheComet uncoiled from thesiding into athin, straight line,and
went on.intothemountains, with thebeam oftheheadlight likean
extended armpointing theway,andthelighted glass curve ofthe
observation lounge ending itoff.
Some ofthepassengers aboard theComet were awake. Asthe
train started itscoiling ascent; theysawthesmall duster ofWinston’s
lights atthebottom ofthedarkness beyond theirwindows, then the
same darkness, butwith redandgreen lights bytheholeofatunnel
ontheupper edge ofthewindowpanes. The lights ofWinston kept
growing smaller, each time they appeared; theblack hole ofthe
tunnel keptgrowing larger.Ablack veilwent streaking past the
windows attimes, dimming thelights: itwastheheavy smoke trom
thecoal-burning engine.
Asthetunnel came closer, theysaw, attheedge oftheskyfarto
thesouth, inavoid ofspace androck, aspot otliving firetwisting
inthewind.They didnotknow what itwasanddidnotcaretolearn.
Itissaid thatcatastrophes areamatter ofpure chance, andthere
were thosewhowould have said that thepassengers oftheComet

Chapter VIIIBYOURLOVE
Thesuntouched thetree topsontheslope ofthe hill,andthey
looked abluish-silver, catching thecolor ofthesky.Dagny stood at
thedoor ofthecabin, with the firstsunrays onherforehead and
miles offorest spread under her feet.Theleaves wentdown from
silver togreen tothesmoky blueoftheshadows ontheroad below.
The light trickled down through thebranches andshotupward in
sudden spurts when ithitaclump offerns thatbecame afountain
ofgreen rays. Itgave herpleasure towatch themotion ofthelight
over astillness where nothing elsecould move.
Shehadmarked thedate, asshedideach morning, onthesheet
ofpaper shehadtacked tothewall ofherroom. Theprogression
ofthedates onthatpaper was theonlymovement inthe stillness of
herdays, liketherecord keptbyaprisoner onadesert island. This
morning’s datewasMay 28.
Shehadintended thedates tolead toapurpose, butshecould
notsaywhether shehadreached itornot.Shehadcome here with
three assignments given, asorders, toherself: rest—learn tolivewith-
outtherailroad—getthepainoutoftheway.Get itoutoftheway,
were thewords sheused. She feltasifshewere tied tosome
wounded stranger whocould bestricken atanymoment byanattack
thatwould drown herinhisscreams. She feltnopityforthestranger,
only acontemptuous impatience; shehad tofighthimanddestroy
him,then herwaywould beclear todecide what shewished todo;
butthestranger wasnoteasy tofight.
Theassignment toresthadbeen easier. Shefound thatsheliked
thesolitude; sheawakened inthemorning withafeeling ofconfident
benevolence, thesense thatshecould venture forthandbewilling
todealwithwhatever shefound. Inthecity,shehadlived inchronic
tension towithstand theshock ofanger, indignation, disgust, con-
tempt. Theonlydanger tothreaten herherewasthesimple painof
some physical accident; itseemed innocent andeasybycomparison.
Thecabin was farfrom anytraveled road; ithadremained asher
father bad left it.Shecooked hermeals onawood-burning stove
andgathered thewood onthehillsides. Shecleared thebrush from
under herwalls, shereshingled theroof, sherepainted the|door and
theframes ofthewindows. Rains, weeds andbrush hadfallowed
thesteps ofwhathadonce been aterraced path rising upthe hill
from theroad tothecabin. She rebuilt it,clearing thetei^aces, re-
laying thestones, bracing thebanks ofsoftearth with wall? ofboul-
560
ders. Itgave herpleasure todevise complex systems oflevers and
pulleys outofoldscraps ofironandrope, then tomove weights of
rock thatweremuch beyond herphysical power. Sheplanted afew
seeds ofnasturtiums andmorning glories, toseeonespreading slowly
over theground andtheother climbing upthetree trunks, tosee
them grow, toseeprogression andmovement.
Thework gaveherthecalmneeded; shehadnotnoticed howshe
began itorwhy;shehadstarted without conscious intention, butshe
saw itgrowing under herhands, pulling herforward, giving hera
healing sense ofpeace. Then sheunderstood thatwhat sheneeded
wasthemotion toapurpose, nomatter how small orinwhat form*
thesense ofanactivity going stepbystep tosome chosen endacross
aspan oftime.Thework ofcooking amealwaslikeadosed rircle,
completed andgone, leading nowhere. Butthework ofbuilding a
pathwasaliving sum, sothatnodaywas lefttodiebehind her,but
eachdaycontained allthose thatpreceded it,eachdayacquired its
immortality onevery succeeding tomorrow. Acircle, shethought, is
themovement proper tophysical nature, they saythat there’s noth-
ingbutcircular motion intheinanimate universe around us,butthe
straight line isthebadge ofman, thestraight lineofageometrical
abstraction thatmakes roads, railsandbridges, thestraight linethat
cutsthecurving aimlessness ofnature byapurposeful motion from
astart toanend.Thecooking ofmeals, shethought, islikethe
feeding ofcoal toanengine forthesake ofagreat run,butwhat
would betheimbecile torture ofcoaling anengine thathadnorun
tomake? Itisnotproper forman’s lifetobeadreie, shethought,
orastring ofcircles dropping offlikezeros behind him— man’s life
must beastraight line ofmotion from goal tofarther goal, each
leading tothenextandtoasingle growing sum, likeajourney down
thetrack ofarailroad, from station tostation to—oh,stop ill
Stop it—shetoldherself inquiet severity, when thescream ofthe
wounded stranger waschoked off—don’t think ofthat, don’t look
toofar,you likebuilding thispath, build it,don’t lookbeyond the
lootofthe hill.
Shehaddriven afewtimes tothestore inWoodstock, twenty
miles away, tobuysupplies andfood.Woodstock wasasmall huddle
ofdying structures, built generations agoforsome reason andhope
long since forgotten. There wasnorailroad tofeed it,noelectric
power, nothing butacounty highway growing emptier yearbyyear.
Theonly storewasawooden hovel, withspider-eaten corners and
arotted patch inthemiddle ofthefloor, eaten bytherains that
came through theleaking roof.Thestorekeeper wasafat,pallid
woman whomoved with effort, butseemed indifferent toherown
discomfort. The stock offood consisted ofdusty cans withfaded
labels, some grain, andafewvegetables rotting inancient binsout-
sidethedoor. ‘'Why don’t youmove those vegetables outofthe
sun?” Dagny asked once.Thewoman looked atherblankly, asif
unable tounderstand thepossibility ofsuch aquestion. ‘•'They’ve
always been there,” sheanswered indifferently.
Driving back tothecabin, Dagny looked upatamountain stream
that fellwith ferocious forcedown asheer granite wall* itsspray
561
hanging likeamistofrainbows inthesun.Shethought thatone
could build ahydroelectric plant, just large enough tosupply the
power forhercabin and forthetown ofWoodstock—Woodstock
could bemade tobeproductive—those wildapple trees shesaw in
suchunusual numbers among thedense growth onthehillsides, were
theremnants oforchards—suppose onewere toreclaim them, then
build asmall spur tothenearest railroad—oh,stop it!
"Nokerosene today," thestorekeeper toldheronhernext trip
toWoodstock. "Itrained Thursday night, andwhen itrains, the
trucks can’t getthrough Fairfield gorge, theroad’s flooded, andthe
kerosene truck won’t beback thisway tillnextmonth." “Ifyou
know thattheroad getsflooded every time itrams,whydon't you
people repair it?"Thewoman answered, "The road’s always been
thatway."
Driving back, Dagny stopped onthecrest ofahillandlooked
down atthemiles ofcountryside below. Shelooked atFairfield gorge
where thecounty road, twisting through marshy soilbelow thelevel
ofariver, gottrapped macrack between two hills. Itwould be
simple toby-pass those hills, shethought, tobuild aroadonthe
other sideoftheriver—thepeople ofWoodstock hadnothing todo,
shecould teach them—cutaroad straight tothesouthwest, save
mites, connect with thestatehighway atthefreight depot of--oh,
stop it!
Sheputherkerosene lamp aside and satinhercabin afterdark
bythe light ofacandle, listening tothemusic ofasmall portable
radio. Shehunted forsymphony concerts andtwisted thedialrapidly
pastwhenever shecaught theraucous syllables ofanews broadcast;
shedidnotwant anynews from the city.
Don’t think ofTaggart Transcontinental —shehadtold herself on
her first night inthecabin—don't think of ituntil you’re able to
hear thewords asiftheywere "Atlantic Southern" or"Associated
Steel.” Buttheweeks passed andnoscarwould grow over the
wound.
Itseemed toherasifshewere fighting theunpredictable cruelty
ofherownmind. Shewould lieinbed, drifting offtosleep—then
find herself suddenly thinking thattheconveyor beltwasworn at
thecoaling station atWillow Bend, Indiana, shehadseen itfrom
thewindow ofhercaronherlast trip,shemust tellthem toreplace
itorthey—andthen shewould besitting upinbed, crying. Stop
it!—andstopping it,butremaining awake fortherestofthatnight
Shewould sitatthedoor ofthecabin atsunset andwatch the
motion oftheleaves growing still inthetwilight—then shewould
seethesparks ofthe fireflies rising from thegrass, flashing onand
offinevery darkening comer, flashing slowly, asifholding onemo-
ment’s warning—theywere likethelights ofsignals winking atnight
over thetrack ofa—Stop it!;
Itwasthetimeswhen shecould notstop itthatshedreaded, the
times when, unable tostand up—asinphysical pain, withnolimit
todivide itfrom thepain ofhermind—shewould falldotyn onthe
floor ofthecabin orontheearth ofthewoods and sitstill;with her
facepressed toachair orarock,and fight nottoletherself scream
562
aloud, while theywere suddenly asclose toherandasrealasthe
body ofalover: thetwo lines ofrailgoing offtoasingle point in
thedistance—thefront ofanengine cutting space apart bymeans
ofthe lettersTT—thesound ofthewheels clicking inaccented
rhythm under thefloor ofhercar—thestatue ofNatTaggart inthe
concourse oftheTerminal. Fighting nottoknow them, nottofeel
them, herbody rigid butforthegrinding motion ofherfaceagainst
herarm, shewould draw whatever power over herconsciousness
stillremained toherintothesoundless, toneless repetition ofthe
words: Get itover with.
There were long stretches ofcalm, when shewasable toface
herproblem with thedispassionate clarity ofweighing aproblem in
engineering. Butshecould findnoanswer. Sheknew thatherdesper-
atelonging fortherailroad would vanish, were shetoconvince her-
selfthat itwasimpossible orimproper. Butthelonging came from
thecertainty thatthetruthandtherightwere hers—thattheenemy
wastheirrational and theunreal—thatshecould notsetherself
another goal orsummon thelove toachieve it,while herrightful
achievement hadbeen lost, nottosome superior power, buttoa
loathsome evilthatconquered bymeans ofimpotence.
Shecould renounce therailroad, shethought; shecould findcon-
tentment here, inthis forest; butshewould build thepath, then
reach (heroad below, then rebuild theroad—andthen shewould
reach thestorekeeper ofWoodstock andthatwould betheend,and
theempty white facestaring attheuniverse instagnant apathy would
bethelimitplaced onhereffort.Why?—sheheard herself screaming
aloud. There wasnoanswer.
Then stayhere until youanswer it,shethought. Youhaveno
place togo,youcan’tmove, youcan tstartgrading aright-of-way
until . .untilyouknow enough tochoose aterminal.
There were long, silent evenings when theemotion thatmade her
sitstillandlook attheunattainable distance beyond thefading light
tothesouth, wasloneliness forHank Reardon. Shewanted thesight
ofhisunyielding face, theconfident facelooking atherwith thehint
ofasmile. Butsheknew thatshecould notseehim until herbattle
waswon. Hissmile hadtobedeserved, itwasintended foranadver-
sarywhotraded herstrength against his,notforapain-beaten wretch
whowould seek relief inthatsmile andthus destroy itsmeaning.
Hecould help*her tolive;hecould nothelphertodecide forwhat
purpose shewished togoonliving.
Shehad feltafaint touch ofanxiety since themorning when she
marked “May 15"onhercalendar. Shehadforced herself tolisten
tonews broadcasts, once inawhile; shehadheard nomention of
hisname. Her fear forhimwasher last link tothe city; itkept
drawing hereyes tothehorizon atthesouth anddown totheroad
atthefootofthe hill.Shefound herself waiting forhimtocome.
Shefound herself listening forthesound ofamotor. Buttheonly
sound togive herafutile start ofhope attimes, wasthesudden
crackle ofsome large bird’s wings hurtling through thebranches into
thesky:
There wasanother link tothepast, that stillremained asanun-
563
solved question: Quentin Daniels andthemotor thathewastrying
torebuild. ByJune 1,shewould owehim hismonthly check. Should
she tellhimthatshehadquit, thatshewould never need thatmotor
andneither would theworld? Should she tellhim tostopandtolet
theremnant ofthemotor vanish inrustonsome suchjunk pileas
theonewhere shehadfound it?Shecould notforce herself todo
it.Itseemed harder than leaving the railroad. That motor, she
thought, wasnotalinktothepast: itwasherlastlink tothefuture.
Tokill itseemed likeanact,notofmurder, butofsuicide: herorder
tostop itwould behersignature under thecertainty that there was
noterminal forhertoseek ahead.
But itisnottrue—shethought, asshestood atthedoor ofher
cabin, onthismorning ofMay 28—itisnottrue thatthere isno
place inthefuture forasuperlative achievement ofman’s mind; it
cannever betrue.Nomatter what herproblem, thiswould always
remain toher—thisimmovable conviction that evilwasunnatural
andtemporary. She felt itmore clearly thanever thismorning: the
certainty thattheugliness ofthemen inthecityandtheugliness of
hersuffering were transient accidents—while thesmiling sense of
hope within heratthesight ofasun-flooded forest, thesense ofan
unlimited promise, wasthepermanent andthe real.
Shestood atthedoor, smoking acigarette. Intheroom behind
her,thesounds ofasymphony ofhergrandfather’s timewerecoming
from theradio Shebarely listened, shewasconscious only ofthe
flowofchords thatseemed toplayanunderscoring harmony forthe
flowofthesmoke curving slowly from hercigarette, forthecurving
motion ofherarmmoving thecigarette toher lipsonce inawhile.
Shedosed hereyesandstood still, feeling theraysofthesunon
herbody. Thiswastheachievement, shethought—toenjoy thismo-
ment, toletnomemory ofpainblunt hercapacity tofeelasshe felt
rightnow; solong asshecould preserve thisfeeling, shewould have
thefuel togoon.
Shewasbarely aware ofafaint noise thatcame through themusic,
likethescratching ofanoldrecord. The first thing toreach her
consciousness wasthesudden jerkofherownhand flinging theciga-
rette aside. Itcame inthesame instant astherealization that the
noisewasgrowing louder andthat itwasthesound ofamotor. Then
sheknew thatshehadnotadmitted toherself howmuch shehad
wanted tohear thatsound, howdesperately shehadWaited forHank
Rearden. Sheheard herownchuckle—itwashumbly, cautiously low,
asifnottodisturb thedrone ofrevolving metal which wasnow the
unmistakable sound ofacarrising upthemountain road.
Shecould notseetheroad—thesmall stretch under thearch of
branches atthefoot ofthe hillwasheronly view of it-^-butshe
watched thecar’s ascenl bythegrowing, imperious strajn ofthe
motor against thegrades andthescreech ofthetiresoncfirvcs.
Thecarstopped under thearchofbranches. ShedidnotRecognize
it—itwasnottheblackHammond, butalong, gray convertible. She
sawthedriver step out: itwasamanwhose presence here "could not
bepossible. ItwasFrancisco d’Anconia.
Theshock she feltwasnotdisappointment, itwasmore likethe
564
sensation thatdisappointment would nowbeirrelevant. Itwaseager-
nessandanodd,solemn stillness, thesudden certainty thatshewas
facing theapproach ofsomething unknown andofthegravest
importance.
The swiftness ofFrancisco’s movements wascarrying himtoward
thehillwhile hewasraising hishead toglance up.Hesawherabove,
atthedoor ofthecabin, andstopped. Shecould notdistinguish the
expression onhisface.Hestood stillforalongmoment, hisface
raised toher.Then hestarted upthe hill.
She felt—almost asifshehadexpected it—that thiswasascene
from their childhood. Hewascoming toward her,notrunning, but
moving upward with akind oftriumphant, confident eagerness. No,
shethought, thiswasnottheir childhood—itwasthefuture asshe
would have seen itthen, inthedayswhen shewaited forhimasfor
herrelease from prison. Itwasamoment’s view ofamorning they
would have reached, ifhervision oflifehadbeen fulfilled, ifthey
hadbothgone thewayshehadthenbeen socertain ofgoing. Held
motionless bywonder, shestood looking athim. taking thismoment,
notinthename ofthepresent, butasasalute totheir past.
When hewascloseenough andshecould distinguish hisface, she
sawthelook ofthatluminous gaiety which transcends thesolemn
byproclaiming thegreat innocence ofamanwho hasearned the
right tobelight-hearted. Hewassmiling andwhistling some piece
ofmusic thatseemed toflow' likethelong, smooth, rising flight of
hissteps.Themelody seemed distantly familiar toher,she feltthat
itbelonged with thismoment, yetshe feltalso thatthere wassome-
thingoddabout it,something important tograsp, onlyshecould not
think ofitnow.
“Hi. Slug!”
“Hi, Frisco’”
Sheknew—bythewayhekicked ather,byaninstant's drop of
hiseyelids dosing hiseyes, bythebrief pullofhishead striving to
leanback and tesist, bythe faint, half-smiling, half-helpless relax-
ation ofhislips,bythesudden harshness ofhisarms asheseized
her—that itwasinvoluntary, thathehadnotintended it,andthat it
was irresistibly right forboth ofthem.
Thedesperate violence ofthewayheheld her,thehurting pres-
sureofhismouth onhers, theexultant surrender ofhisbody tothe
touch ofhers,were nottheform ofamoment’s pleasure—sheknew
thatnophysical hunger could bring amantothis—sheknew that it
wasthestatement shehadnever heard from him, thegreatest confes-
sionoflove aman could make.Nomatter what hehaddone to
wreck his life, thiswas stilltheFrancisco d’Anconia inwhose bed
shehadbeen soproud ofbelonging—nomatter what betrayals she
hadmetfrom theworld, hervision oflifehadbeen trueandsome
indestructible partofithadremained within him—andinanswer to
it,herbodyresponded tohis,herarmsandmouth heldhim,confess-
ingherdesire, confessing anacknowledgment shehadalways given
himandalways would.
Then .the restofhisyearscame back toher,with astab ofthe
painofknowing that thegreater hisperson, themore terrible his
565
guilt indestroying it.Shepulled herself away from him, sheshook
herhead, shesaid, inanswer toboth ofthem, “No.”
Hestood looking ather,disarmed andsmiling. “Not yet.Youhave
agreat deal toforgive me, first.But Ican tellyoueverything now.”
Shehadnever heard that low, breathless quality ofhelplessness
inhisvoice.Hewas fighting toregain control, there wasalmost a
touch ofapology inhissmile, theapology ofachild pleading for
indulgence, butthere wasalsoanadult’s amusement, thelaughing
declaration thathedidnothave tohide hisstruggle, .since itwas
happiness thathewaswrestling with, notpain.
Shebacked away from him; she feltasifemotion hadflung her
ahead ofherown consciousness, andquestions werenowcatching
upwith her,groping toward theform ofwords.
“Dagny. thattorture you’ve been going through, here, forthelast
month . ..answer meashonestly asyoucan...doyouthink you

‘No.” sheanswered; hesmiled. “Why doyouaskthat?”
“Toredeem twelve years ofmy life,which lwon’t have toregret.”
“What doyoumean? And” -her questions hadcaught upwith
her—“and whatdoyouknow aboutmytorture here?”
“Dagny, aren’t youbeginning toseethat Iwould know everything
about it?”
“How didyou ...Francisco! What wereyouwhistling when you
werecoming upthe hill?”
“Why, was 1? Idon’t know.”
“ItwastheFifthConcerto byRichard Halley, wasn’t it?”
“Oh . . .!”Helooked startled, then smiled inamusement at
himself, thenanswered gravely, “I'll tellyouthat later,”
“How didyou findoutwhere Iwas*>”
“I'll tellyou that, too.”
“You forced itoutofEddie.”
“Ihaven’t seenEddie forover ayear.”
“Hewastheonlyonewhoknew it.”
“Itwasn’t Eddiewho toldme.”
“Ididn’t wantanybody tofindme”
Heglanced slowly about him, shesaw hiseyes stoponthepath
shehad built, ontheplanted flowers, onthefresh-shingled roof.He
chuckled, asifheunderstood and asifithurthim.“You shouldn’t

“Really? What for?”
“Tospare you”—hepointed atherwork— “all this.’

“Isit?”
“Forgive me, Imustn’t saythat.Not untilyousay it.”Hewas
trying tocontrol hisvoice, butthelookofhappiness wasbeyond his

Heglanced straight ather, hiseyesdrawn narrow bysuchan
intensity ofearnestness thattheglance wasalmost athreat, andshe
knew thatwhatever theyears hadmeant tohim—“amusement” was
theoneword shehadnoright toutter.
“Doyou really think that?” heasked.
Shewhispered, “No . .
“Dagny, wecannever losethethings welive for.Wemayhave

“Thai iswhat I’vebeen telling myself foiamonth. Butthere’s no

Hedidnotanswer. Hesatdown onaboulder bythedoor ofthe

andvanished?” heasked.
Sheshrugged, with afaint smile ofhelpless sadness, andsatdown
ontheground beside him.“You know,” shesaid. “Iused tothink
thattherewassome destroyer whocame afterthem andmade them

nobody came.”
“No?”
“No. Iused tothink, thathegavethemsome inconceivable reason

sary. Iknowhowthey felt. Ican’tblame them anylonger. What I
don’tknow ishowthey learned toexist afterward—ifanyofthem

“Doyou feelthatyou’ve betrayed Taggart Transcontinental?”
“No. I... Ifeel that Iwould have betrayed itbyremaining
atwork.”
“You would have.”
“If 1hadagreed toserve thelooters, it’s .. .it’sNatTaggart

“Ithink that Iwould givemy lifeforjustonemore yearonthe

‘“Then youknow what they felt, allthemenwho quit,andwhat

“Francisco,” sheasked, hotlooking athim,herhead bent,“why
didyouaskmewhether Lcould have given ituptwelve years ago?”
567
"‘Don’t youknow what night Iamthinking of,justasyouare?'1
‘"Yes ...” shewhispered.
“That wasthenight Igaveupd’Anconia Copper.'’
Slowly, with along effort, shemoved herhead toglance upat
him.Hisfacehadtheexpression shehadseen then, onthatnext
morning, twelve years ago: thelook ofasmile, though hewasnot
smiling, thequiet look ofvictory over pain, thelook ofaman’s pride
intheprice hepaidand inthatwhich made itworth paying.
“But youdidn't give itup.” she said.“You didn't quit. You’re
stillthePresident ofd’Anconia Copper, only itmeans nothing to
younow.”
“Itmeans asmuch tomenow asitdidthat night.”
"Then howcanyou let itgotopieces7”
“Dagny, you're more fortunate than I.Taggart Transcontinental

“Francisco!” shescreamed. “How could youmake yourself doit?”
“By thtfgrace ofthesame love asyours,” heanswered quietly,
“my love ford’Anconia Copper, forthe spirit ofwhich itwasthe

She sat still, trying tograsp alltheimplications ofwhat shenow
grasped only asthenumbness ofshock. Inthesilence, themusic of
theradiosymphony went on.andtherhythm ofthechords reached
herliketheslow, solemn pounding ofsteps, while shestruggled to
seeatonce thewhole progression oftwelve years: thetortured boy
who called forhelponherbreasts—themanwho satonthefloor

ofgreat industries—themanwho cried,“My love, Ic^n’t!” while

“Harder,” shewhispered. “I’m notsure Icantake it.even now.

shethrew herhead back suddenly tolookupathim—“ifthiswas

_Oli yes,mydarling, yes,youwere theworst ofit!” Itwasa

Helaised hishead, smiling, helooked down atherandshesaw
alook ofprotective tenderness come into hisface,which toldher
ofthedespair hesaw inhers.
“Dagny, don’t think ofthat. 1won tclaim anysuffering ofmine

hurtyou terribly I’llneed years tomake upfor it.Forget what”—she
knew thathemeant: what hisembrace hadconfessed—“what 1

every scar ofthetorture younever should havehad tobear.AH
thatmatters now isthatyou’re free torecover. We’re free,bothof
us.we're freeofthelooters, we're outoftheir reach.”
She said, hervoice quietly desolate, “That’s what 1came here

“Yes, Dagny, itwasourown guilt."
"Because wedidn’t work hardenough?"
"Because weworked toohard—andcharged too little."
"What doyoumean?"
"We neverdemanded theonepayment thattheworld owed us—

“The details ofthestorywere obtained fromLuke Beal, fireman
oftheTaggart luxury main liner, theComet, whowasfound uncon-
571
scious atthewestern portal ofthetunnel thismorning, andwho
appears tobethesolesurvivor ofthecatastrophe. Through some
astounding infraction ofsafety rules— incircumstances notyetfully
established—theComet, westbound forSanFrancisco, wassent into
thetunnel with acoal-burning steam locomotive. TheTaggart run-
nel,aneight-mile bore, cutthrough thesummit oftheRocky Moun-
tainsandregarded asanengineering achievement nottobeequaled
inourtime,was builtbythegrandson ofNathaniel Taggart, inthe
great ageoftheclean, smokeless Diesel-electric engine Thetunnel's
ventilation system wasnotdesigned toprovide fortheheavy smoke
andfumes ofcoal-burning locomotives —and itwasknown toevery
railroad employee inthedistrict thattosend atrain intothetunnel
withsuch alocomotive would mean death bysuffocation forevery-
oneaboard. TheComet, none the less,wassoordered toproceed.
According toFireman Beal, theeffects ofthefumes began tobefelt
when thetrainwasabout three miles inside thetunnel. Engineer
Joseph Scott threw thethrottle wide open, inadesperate attempt
togamspeed, buttheold,worn engine wasinadequate fortheweight
ofthelong trainandtherising grade ofthetrack. Struggling through
thethickening fumes, engineer andfireman hadbarely managed to
force theleaking steam boilers uptoaspeed offorty miles per
hour—whensome passenger, prompted undoubtedly bythepanic of
choking, pulled theemergency brake cord.Thesudden joltofthe
stop apparently broke theengine's airhose, forthetrain could not
bestarted again. There were screams coming from thecars. Passen-
gerswere breaking windows. Engineer Scott struggled frantically to
make theengine start, butcollapsed atthethrottle, overcome bythe
fumes. Fireman Beal leaped from theengine and ran.Hewaswithin
sight ofthewestern portal, when heheard theblast oftheexplosion,
which isthe lastthing heremembers. The restofthestory was
gathered from railroad employees atWinston Station. Itappears that
anArmy Freight Special, westbound, carrying aheavy loadofexplo-
sives, had*been given nowarning about thepresence oftheComet
onthetrack justahead. Both trains hadencountered delays and
were running offtheir schedules. Itappears thattheFreight Special
hadbeen ordered toproceed regardless ofsignals, because thetun-
nel's signal .system wasoutofordei .Itissaid that inspite ofspeed
regulations and inview ofthefrequent breakdowns oftheventilating
system, itwasthetacitcustom ofallengineers togofullspeed while
inthetunnel. Itappears, asfarascanbeestablished atpresent, that
theComet wasstalled justbeyond thepoint where thetunnel makes
asharp curve. Itisbelieved thateveryone aboard wasdead bythai
time. Itisdoubted that theengineer oftheFreight Special, turning
acurve ateighty miles anhour, would havebeen at$e tosee, in

Hisletter ofresignation layonthedesk before him—andJames
Taggart satstaring atit.hunched byhatred. Hefeltasifhisenemy
were thispiece ofpaper, notdiewords on it,butthesheet andthe
inkthathadgiven thewords amaterial finality. Hehadalways re-
garded thought andwords asinconclusive, butamaterial shape was
thatwhich hehadspent his lifeescaping: acommitment.
Hehadnotdecided toresign -not really, hethought; hehaddic-
tated theletter foramotive which heidentified tohimself only as
‘just incase.” The letter, hefelt,wasatorm ofprotection: buthe
hadnotsigned ityet,andthatwas hisprotection against theprotec-
tion.Thehatred wasdirected atwhatever hadbrought himtofeel
thathewould notbeable tocontinue extending thisprocess much
longer.
Hehadreceived word ofthecatastrophe ateight o'clock this
morning; bynoon, hehadarrived athisoffice.Aninstinct thatcame
from reasons which heknew, butspent hiswhole effort onnotknow-
ing,hadtoldhim thathehadtobethere, thistime.
Themenwhohadbeen hismarked cards—inagame heknew
how toplay -were gone. Clifton Looey wasbarricaded behind the
statement ofadoctor whohadannounced thatMr.Locey wassuffer-
ingfrom aheait condition which made itimpossible todisturb him
atpresent. One ofTaggart’s executive assistants was said tohave
leftforBoston lastnight, andtheother wassaid tohavebeen called
unexpectedly toanunnamed hospital, tothebedside ofafather
nobody hadeversuspected himofhaving. There wasnoanswer :U
thehome ofthechief engineer. Thevice-president incharge ofpub-
licrelations could notbefound.
Driving through thestreets tohisoffice, Taggart hadseen the
black letters oftheheadlines. Walking down thecorridors ofTaggart
573
Transcontinental .hehadheard thevoice ofaspeaker pouring from
aradio insomeone’s office, the
%kind ofvoice oneexpects tohear
onunlighted street comers: itwasscreaming demands forthenation-
alization oftherailroads.
Hehadwalked through thecorridors, hissteps noisy, inorder to
beseen,andhasty, inorder nottobestopped forquestions. Hehad
locked thedoor ofhisoffice, ordering hissecretary nottoadmit any
person orphone callandtotell allcomers thatMr,Taggart wasbusy.
Then hesatathisdesk, alone withblank terror. Hefeltasifhe
were trapped inasubterranean vaultandthelockcould never be
broken again—andasifhewere heldondisplay inthesight ofthe
whole citybelow, hoping thatthelockwould hold outforeternity.
Hehadtobehere, inthis office, itwasrequired ofhim,hehad to

todetermine hisactions—and theterror wasboth ofwhowould
come forhimandofthefactthatnobody came, nobody totellhim
what todo.
The ringing ofthetelephones intheouter office sounded like
screams forhelp.Helooked atthedoor with asensation ofmalevo-
lenttriumph atthethought ofallthose voices being defeated bythe
innocuous figure ofhissecretary, ayoung manexpert atnothing but
theartofevasion, which hepracticed with thegray, rubber limpness
oftheamoral. The voices, thought Taggart, were coining from Colo-
rado, from every center oftheTaggart system, from every office of
thebuilding around him.Hewassalesolong ashedidnothave to
hearthem.
Hisemotions haddogged into astill, solid, opaque ballwithin
him.which thethought ofthemenwhooperated theTaggart system
could notpierce: thosemenwere merely enemies tobeoutwitted.
Thesharper bites offearcame from thethought ofthemenonthe
Board ofDirectors; buthisletter ofresignation was hisfireescape,
which would leave them stuck with the lire.Thesharpest tearcame
from thethought ofthemen inWashington. Ifthey called, hewould
have toanswer; hisrubber secretary wouldknowwhose voices super-
seded hisorders. ButWashington didnot call.
The fearwent through him inspasms, once inawhile, leaving his
mouth dry.Hedidnotknow what hedreaded. Heknew that itwas
notthethreat oftheradio speaker. What hehadexperienced atthe
sound ofthesnarling voice hadbeenmore like aterror which he
feltbecause hewasexpected tofeel it,aduty-teiror, something that
went with hisposition, likewell-tailored suitsandluncheon speeches.
Butunder it,hehad fellasneaking littlehope, swiftandlurtive like
thecourse ofacockroach: itthat threat took form, itwould solve
everything, savehimfrom decision, save himfrom signing the
letter ...hewould notbePresident ofTaggart Transcontinental
anylonger, butneither would anyone else . . .neitherf would any-
one else. . ..
Hesat,looking down athisdesk, keeping hiseyesapd hismind
outoffocus. Itwasasifhewereimmersed inapooloffcjg,struggling
nottolet itreach thefinality ofanyform. Thatwhich exists possesses
identity; hecould keep itoutofexistence byrefusing t^identify it.

Hedidnotexamine theevents inColorado, hedidnotattempt
tograsp their cause* hedidnotconsider their consequences. Hedid
notthink Theclogged ballofemotion was likeaphysical weight in
hischest, filling hisconsciousness, releasing hintfrom theresponsibil-
ityofthought. The ballwashatred™ hatred ashisonlyanswer, ha-
tred asthesole reality, hatred without object, cause, beginning or
end,hatred ashisclaim against theuniverse, asajustification, asa
right, asanabsolute.
Thescreaming ofthetelephones wentonthrough thesilence. He
knew thatthose pleas forhelpwere notaddressed tohim,buttoan
entity whose shape hehadstolen. Itwas thisshape thatthescreams
werenow tearing away from him:hefeltasiftheringing ceased to
besounds andbecame asuccession ofslashes hitting hisskull.The
object ofthehatred began totakeform, asifsummoned bythebells.
The solid ballexploded within himandflunghimblindly into action.
Rushing outoftheroom, indefiance ofallthefacesaround him,
hewent running down thehalls totheOperating Department and
intotheanteroom oftheOperating Vice-President's office.
Thedoor totheoffice wasopen, hesaw thesky inthegreat
windows beyond anempty desk.Then hesawthestaff intheanteroom
around turn,andtheblond head ofEddie Willers intheglasscubby-
hole.Hewalked purposefully straight toward Eddie Willers. heflung
theglassdooropen and,from thethreshold, inthesightandhearing
oftheroom, hescreamed:
“Where isshe?”
Eddie Willers roseslowly tohisfeetandstood looking atTaggart
withanoddkind ofdutiful curiosity, asifthiswereonemore phe-
nomenon toobserve among alltheunprecedented things hehad
observed. Hedidnotanswer.
“Where isshe?”
‘Tcannot tellyou.”
“Listen, youstubborn littlepunk, this isnotime forceremony! If
you’re trying tomakemebelieve thatyoudon'tknow where she is,
Idon’t believe you!Youknow itandyou’re going totellme,orI’ll
report youtotheUnification Board! I’llsweai tothem thatyou
know it—then tryandprove thatyoudon’t!”
There was afaint tone ofastonishment inEddie’s voice ashe
answered, “I’ve never attempted toimply that Idon’tknow where
she is,Jim. Iknow it.But 1won’t tellyou.”
Taggart's scream rose tothe shrill, impotent sound thatconfesses
amiscalculation: “Doyou realize what you’re saying?”
“Why, yes,ofcourse.”
“Will yourepeat it”—hewaved at(heroom—“for these wit-
nesses?”
Eddie raised hisvoice alittle,more inprecision and clarity than
involume: “Iknow where she is.But Iwillnot tellyou.”
“You’re confessing that you're anaccomplice who’s aiding and
abetting adeserter?”
“Ifthat’s whatyouwish tocall it.”
“But it’sacrime! It'sacrime against thenation. Don’t you
know that?”
575
“No,”
“It’s against thelaw!”
“Yes.”
“This isanational emergency! Youhavenoright toanyprivate
secrets! You’re withholding vital information! I’mthePresident of
thisrailroad! I’mordering youtotellme!You can’t refuse toobey
anorder! It'sapenitentiary offense! Doyouunderstand?”
“Yes.”
“Doyourefuse?”
“1do.”
Years oftraining hadmade Taggart able towatch anyaudience
around him, without appearing todoso.Hesawthe tight, closed
faces ofthe staff, faces thatwere nothisallies. Allhadalook of
despair, except thefaceofEddie Willers. The“feudal serf’ ofTag-
gartTranscontinental wastheonlyonewhoseemed untouched by
thedisaster. Helooked atTaggart with the lifelessly conscientious
glance ofascholar confronted byaheld ofknowledge hehadnever
wanted tostudy.
“Doyou realize thatyou're atraitor?” yelled Taggart.
Eddie asked quietly, “Towhom?”
“To thepeople! It’streason toshield adeserter’ It’seconomic
treason! Your duty tofeed thepeople comes first,above anything
elsewhatever! Every public authority hassaid so!Don't youknow
it?Don't youknow what they’ll dotoyou?”
“Don’t youseethat Idon't give adamn about that?”
“Oh, youdon’t? I’llquote that totheUnification Board! 1have
allthese witnesses toprove thatyousaid—”
“Don’t bother about witnesses, JimDon’t putthem onthespot.
I'llwritedown everything Isaid. I'llsign it,andyoucantake itU>
theBoard.”
Thesudden explosion ofTaggart's voicesounded as ilhehadbeen
slapped: “Who areyoutostand against thegovernment? Who are
you,youmiserable little office rat,tojudge national policies and
hold opinions ofyourown?Doyouthink thecountry haslime to
bother about your opinions, your wishes oryour precious littlecon
science? You’re going tolearn alesson—allofyou1--allolyou
spoiled, self-indulgent, undisciplined tittle two-bit clerks, who strut
asifthatcrapabout your rights wasserious! You’re going tolearn
thatthese arenotthedays ofNatTaggart!”
Eddie said nothing. Foraninstant, they stood looking ateach
other across thedesk. Taggart’s lacewasdistorted byterror. Eddie's
remained sternly serene. James Taggart believed theexistence ofan
Eddie Willers toowell;Eddie Willers could notbelieve theexistence
ofaJames Taggart.
“Doyouthink thenation willbother about yourwishes orhers?”
screamed Taggart. “It’sherduty tocome back! It’sherdaty towork!
What dowecarewhether shewants towork ornot?W^need her1”
“Do you,Jim?”
Animpulse pertaining toself-preservation made Tagjgart back a
stepaway from thesound ofthat particular tone, avery quiet tone,
inthevoice ofEddie Willers. ButEddie made nomove tofollow.
576
Heremained standing behind hisdesk, inamanner suggesting the
civilized tradition ofabusiness office.
“You won’t findher,” hesaid.“She won’t beback. I’mgladshe
won’t. Youcanstarve, youcan clt>se therailroad, youcanthrowme
injail,youcanhavemeshot—whatdoes itmatter? Iwon’t tellyou
where she is.Iflseethewhole country crashing, Iwon’t tellyou.
Youwon’t find her.You—”
They whirled atthesound oftheentrance door flung open. They
sawDagny standing onthethreshold.
Shewore awrinkled cotton dress, andherhairwasdisheveled by
hours ofdriving. Shestopped fortheduration ofaglance around
her, as iftorecapture theplace, butthere wasnorecognition of
persons inhereyes, theglance merely swept through theroom, as
ifmaking aswift inventory ofphysical objects. Herfacewasnotthe
lacetheyremembered; ithadaged, notbymeans oflines, butby
means ofastill,naked look stripped ofanyquality save nithlessness.
Yet their firstresponse, ahead ofshock orwonder, wasasingle
emotion thatwent through theroom likeagasp ofrelief. Itwas in
alltheir faces butone;Eddie Willers, whoalone hadbeen calm a
moment ago,collapsed with hisfacedown onhisdesk; hemade no
sound, butthemovements ofhisshoulders were sobs.
Herfacegavenosignofacknowledgment toanyone, nogreeting,
asifherpresence herewere inevitable andnowords were necessary.
Shewent straight tothedoor ofheroffice; passing thedesk ofher
secretary, shesaid, hervoice likethesound otabusiness machine,
neither rudenorgentle, “Ask Eddie tocome in.”
James Taggart wasthe firstonetomove, asifdreading tolether
outofhissight.Herushed inafter her,hecried. “Icouldn thelp
it!”andthen, lifereturning tohim. hisown, hisnormal kindoflife,
hescreamed. “Itwasyour fault!Youdid it!You’re toblame for it!
Because you left!”
Hewondered whether hisscream hadbeen anillusion inside his
own ears.Her faceremained blank; yetshehadturned tohim;she
looked asifsounds hadreached her.butnotwords, notthecommu-
nication ofamind. What hefeltforamoment was hisclosest ap-
proach toasense ofhisown non-existence.
Then hesawthefaintest change inherface,merely theindication
ofperceiving ahuman presence, butshewaslooking pasthimand
heturned andsawthatEddie Willers hadentered theoffice.
There were traces oftears inEddie's eyes, buthemade noattempt
tohidethem, hestood straight, asifthetears oranyembarrassment
oranyapology forthemwere asirrelevant tohimastoher
Shesaid,“GetRyan onthetelephone, tellhimPmhere, then let
mespeak tohim.” Ryan hadbeen thegeneral manager ofthe rail-
road’s Central Region.
Eddie gaveherawarning bynotanswering atonce, then said, his
voice aseven ashers, “Ryan’s gone, Dagny. Hequit lastweek.”
They didnotnotice Taggart, asthey didnotnotice thefurniture
around them. Shehadnotgranted himeven therecognition oforder-
inghimoutofheroffice. Like aparalytic, uncertain ofhismuscles’
obedience, hegathered hisstrength andslipped out.Buthewas
577
certain ofthe firstthing hehadtodo:hehurried tohisoffice to
destroy hisletter ofresignation.
Shedidnotnotice hisexit;shewaslooking atEddie. “IsKnowland
here?’' sheasked.
“No. He’sgone,”
“Andrews?”
“Gone.”
“McGuire?”
“Gone.”
Hewentonquietly torecite the listofthose heknew shewould
askfor,those mostneeded inthishour,whohadresigned andvan-
ished within thepastmonth. Shelistened without astonishment or
emotion* asone listens tothecasually listofabattle where allare
doomed and itmakes nodifference whose names fall first.
When hefinished, shemade nocomment, butasked, “What has
beendone since thismorning?”
“Nothing.”
“Nothing?”
“Dagny, any office boycould have issued orders here since this
morning andeverybody would haveobeyed him.Buteven theoffice
boysknow thatwhoever makes the firstmove today willbeheld
responsible forthefuture, thepresent andthepast—when thebuck-
passing begins. Hewould notsave thesystem, hewould merely lose
hisjobbythetimehesaved one division. Nothing hasbeen done,
ft’sstopped still.Whatever ismoving, ismoving onanyone's blind

Comet. Idon’tknow what themanager inSanFrancisco isdoing.
Only the^wrecking crews areworking. Atthetunnel. They haven't
come anywhere near thewreck asyet. Idon’t think they will.”
“Phone theTerminal manager downstairs and tellhim toput all
transcontinental trains back ontheschedule atonce, including to-
night's Comet. Thencome back here.”
When hecame back, shewasbending ovei themaps shehad
spread onatable, andshespoke while hemade rapid notes:
“Route allwestbound trains south from Kirby, Nebraska, down
thespur track toHastings, down thetrack oftheKansas Western

“Isthattrue?”
“How do Iknow?How cananybody know? Butbythetime they
untangle itanddecide whatever itistheyplease todecide- -ourtrack

“1see.”
‘Tilgoover the listsandgiveyouthenames ofourlocalmen to

“The . ..what?” Hedidnotraise hisvoice, butthecatch ofhis
breath wasthebreak ofemotion hehadwanted toavoid.
Herface didnotchange, but’afaint note inhervoice acknowl-
edged him, anote ofgentleness, notreproof: “The oldmaps ofthe
daysbefore thetunnel. We’re going back, Eddie. Let’shopewccan.
No,wewon’t rebuild thetunnel. There's noway todo itnow.But
(heoldgrade thatcrossed theRockies isstill there. Itcanbere-

Heknew, ashehadknown from the first, thatshehadseen his
tearsand thatshehadnotwalked past inindifference, eventhough
herclear, toneless voice andunmoving facegavehimnosignof
feeling. There wassome quality inhermanner, which hesensed but
could nottranslate. Yetthefeeling itgave him, translated, wasasif
shewere saying tohim: Iknow, 1understand, Iwould feelcompas-
sionandgratitude, ifwewere aliveandfree tofeel,butwe’re not,
arewe,Eddie?— we’re onadead planet, likethemoon, where we
mustmove, butdare notstop forabreath offeeling orwe’ll discover
thatthere isnoairtobreathe.
“Wehave today andtomorrow togetthings started,” she said.
“I’llleave forColorado tomorrow night,”
‘ifyouwant tofly. I’llhave torent aplane foryousomewhere.

“No, I’llgoby rail. Ihave toseethe line. Iiltaketomorrow’s
Comet.”
itwastwohours later, inabrief pause between long-distance
phone calls, thatsheasked himsuddenly the firstquestion which did
579
notpertain tothe railroad; “What have theydone toHank
Rearden?”
Eddie caught himself inthesmall evasion oflooking away, forced
hisglance back tomeet hers,andanswered, “Hegave in.Hesigned
their Gift Certificate, atthe lastmoment.”
“Oh.” Thesound conveyed noshock orcensure, itwasmerely a
vocal punctuation mark, denoting theacceptance ofafact.“Have
youheard fromQuentin Daniels?”
“No.”
“He sentnoletter ormessage forme?”
“No.”
Heguessed thething sheleared and itreminded himofamatter
hehadnotreported. “Dagny, there’s another problem that's been
growing allover thesystem since you lett.SinceMay first. It'sthe
frozen trains.”
“The what?”
“We’ve hadtrains abandoned ontheline,onsome passing track,
inthemiddle ofnowhere, usually atnight™ with theentire crew
gone.They justleave thetrainandvanish. There’s never anywarning
given oranyspecial reason, it'smore likeanepidemic, ithitsthe
mensuddenly andthey go. It’sbeen happening onother railroads,
too.Nobody canexplain it.But Ithink thateverybody understands.
It'sthedirective that’s doing it.It’sourmen's form ofprotest. They
trytogoonandthen theysuddenly reach amoment when they
can't take itanylonger. What canwedoabout it?”Heshrugged.
“Oh well,who isJohn Galt?”
Shenodded thoughtfully; shedidnotlook astonished.
Thetelephone rangandthevoice ofhersecretary said,“Mr.Wes-
leyMouch calling from Washington, Miss Taggart.”
Her lipsstiffened alittle, asattheunexpected touch ofaninsect.
“Itmustbeformybrother,” shesaid.
“No, Miss Taggart. Foryou.”
“Ail right. Puthimon.”
“Miss Taggart,” saidthevoice ofWesley Mouchmthetone ofa
cocktail-partv host, “Iwassoglad tohear you’ve regained your
health that Iwanted towelcome youback inperson. Iknow that
your health required along restand Iappreciate thepatriotism that

anystepyounow find itnecessary totake.Our fullest co-operation,
assistance andsupport. Ifthere areany . . .special exceptions you
might require, please feelcertain thattheycanbegrafted.”
She lethimspeak, eventhough hehadmade several small pauses
inviting ananswer. When hispause became long enoiigh, she said,
U
Iwould bemuch obliged ifyouwould letmesi>eak toMr,
Weatherby.”
“Why, ofcourse, Miss Taggart, anytimeyouwish l ..why . .
that is...doyoumean,nowT’
“Yes. Right now.”
Heunderstood. Buthesaid,“Yes, Miss Taggart.”
580
When Mr.Weatherby’s voicecame onthewire, itsounded cau-
tious: “Yes, MissTaggart? Ofwhat service can Ibetoyou?”
“You can tellyourboss that ifhedoesn’t wantmetoquit again,

body elsehasforgotten it,Ihaven't.”
“It ismyduty toassist thenation’s railroads atanytime. Miss
Taggart.” Mr.Weatherby sounded asifhewere trying toavoid the
commitment ofhaving heard what hehadheard; butasudden note
ofinterest crept into hisvoice asheasked slowly, thoughtfully, with
guarded shrewdness, “Ami tounderstand. Miss Taggart, that itis
yourwish todeal exclusively withmeinallofficial matters? May 1
take thisasyour policy?”
Shegave abrief, harsh chuckle. “Goahead.” shesaid.“Youmay
listmeasyour exclusive properly, usemeasaspecial item ofpull,
andtrademe alloverWashington, But 1don’tknow whatgood that
willdoyou,because I'mnotgoing toplay thegame, I’mnotgoing

“Ibelieve thatyouhave anold-fashioned ideaabout law\Miss
Taggart. Why speak ofrigid, unbreakable laws? Ourmodem law's

“'Ihen start being elastic rightnow, because I'mnotandneither

Shehung up,andsaid toTddie. inthetoneofanestimate passed

Shedidnotseem tonotice thechanges inheroffice: theabsence
olNatTaggart's portrait, thenew glass coftee tablewhere Mr.Locey
hadspread, forthebenefit olvisitors, adisplay oltheloudest human-
itarian magazines with titles ofarticles headlined ontheir covers.
Sheheard*with theattentive look ofamachine equipped tore-
cord, nottoreact— Hddie's account ofwhatonemonth haddone to
therailroad. Sheheard hisreport onwhat heguessed about the
causes ofthecatastrophe. Shefaced, with thesame look ofdetach-
ment, asuccession otmenwhowent inandoutofheroffice with
overhurried steps andhands fumbling insuperfluous gestures. He
thought thatshehadbecome impervious toanything. Butsuddenly—
while pacing theoffice, dictating tohimalistoftrack-laying materi-
alsandwhole toobtain them illegally -she stopped andlooked down
atthemagazines onthecoffee table. Their headlines said:“The
New Social Conscience,” “Our Duty totheUnderprivileged," “Need
versus Greed.” With asingle movement ofherarm. theabrupt,
explosive movement ofsheer physical brutality, such ashehadnever
seenfrom herbefore, sheswept themagazines offthetable and
went on,hervoice reciting alistoffigures without abreak, asif
theie werenoconnection between hermind andtheviolence of
herbody.
581
Late intheafternoon, finding amoment alone inheroffice, she
telephoned Hank Rearden.
Shegave hername tohissecretary—andsheheard, inthewayhe
said it,thehaste withwhich hehadseized thereceiver: “Dagny?”
“Hello, Hank. I’mback.”
“Where?”
“Inmyoffice.”
Sheheard thethings hedidnotsay, inthemoment’s silence on

“Yes.Asmuch of itasyoucan. Itdoesn’t have tobeRearden

“All right. Dagny, doyouknow that I’vesurrendered Rearden

“Yes. Iknow.”
“Tve given in.”

Chapter IXTHEFACEWITHOUT PAINORFEARORGUILT
Thesilence ofherapartment andthemotionless perfection ofobjects
thathadremained justasshehad leftthem amonth before, struck
herwith asense ofrelief anddesolation together, when sheentered
her living room. The silence gave heranillusion ofprivacy and
ownership; thesight oftheobjects reminded herthattheywere pre-
serving amoment shecould notrecapture, asshecould notundo
theevents thathadhappened since.
There was still aremnant ofdaylight beyond thewindows. She
had lefttheoffice earlier than sheintended, unable toiummon the
effort foranytask thatcould bepostponed tillmorning. Thiswas
new toher—and itwasnew thatsheshould now feelminre athome
inherapartment than inheroffice.
Shetook ashower, andstood forlong, blank minutes, letting the
water runover herbody, butstepped outhastily when sherealized
582
thatwhat shewanted towash offwasnotthedustofthedrive from
thecountry, butthefeeloftheoffice.
Shedressed, lighted acigarette andwalked intotheliving room,
tostand atthewindow, looking atthecity,asshehadstood looking
atthecountryside atthestart ofthisday.
Shehad saidshewould giveher lifeforonemore yearonthe
railroad. Shewasback; but thiswasnotthejoyofworking: itwas
onlytheclear, coldpeace ofadecision reached—andthestillness of
unadmitted pain.
Clouds hadwrapped theskyandhaddescended asfogtowrap
thestreets below, asiftheskywere engulfing the city.Shecould
seethewhole ofManhattan Island, along, triangular shape cutting
intoaninvisible ocean. Itlooked liketheprow ofasinking ship: a
few tallbuildings stillroseabove it,likefunnels, buttherestwas
disappearing under gray-blue coils, goingdown slowly intovapor and
space. Thiswashowtheyhadgone—shethought—Atlantis, thecity
thatsank intotheocean, and alltheother kingdoms thatvanished,
leaving thesame legend inallthelanguages ofmen, andthesame
longing.
She felt—asshehad felt itonespring night, slumped across her
desk inthecrumbling olfice oftheJohn Galt Line, byawindow
lacing adarkalley— thesense andvision ofherown world, which
shewould never reach. . .You—shethought— whoever you are,
v\hom 1have always loved andnever found, youwhom Iexpected
toseealtheendottherailsbeyond thehorizon, youwhose presence
Ihadalways feltinthestreets otthecityandwhose world 1had
wanted tobuild, itismylove foryou thathadkeptmemoving, my
loveandmyhope toreach youandmywish tobeworthy ofyou

youonthedaywhen Iwould havemetyou.eventhough Iwon't. * ..
Shehadnever accepted hopelessness, butshestood atthewindow
and,addressed totheshape ofafogbound city, itwasher self-
dedication tounrequited love.
Thedoorbell rang.
Sheturned with indifferent astonishment toopen thedoor—but
sheknew thatsheshould have expected him,when shesawthat it
wasFrancisco d'Anconia. She fellnoshock andnorebellion, only
thecheerless serenity ofherassurance—andsheraised herhead to
facehim, with aslow, deliberate movement, asiftelling him that
shehadchosen herstand andthatshestood intheopen.
Hisfacewasgrave andcalm; thelook ofhappiness wasgone, but
theamusement oftheplayboy hadnotreturned. Helooked asifall
masks weredown, helooked direct, tightly disciplined, intent upon
apurpose, helooked likeaman able toknow theearnestness of
actioh, asshehadonceexpected himtolook—hehadnever seemed
soattractive ashedidinthismoment- -and shenoted, inastonish-
583
meat, hersudden feeling thathewasnotamanwhohaddeserted
her,butamanwhom shehaddeserted,
“Dagny, areyouable totalkabout itnow?”
“Yes—ifyouwish.Come in.”
Heglanced briefly atherliving room, herhome which hehad
never entered, then hiseyescame back toher.Hewaswatching her
attentively. Heseemed toknow thatthequiet simplicity ofherman-
nerwastheworst ofallsigns forhispurpose, that itwas likea
spread ofashes where noflicker ofpaincould berevived, thateven
painwould havebeen aform offire.
“Sitdown, Francisco.”
Sheremained standing before him, asifconsciously letting him
seethat shehadnothing tohide, noteven theweariness ofher
posture, theprice shehadpaid forthisdayandhercarelessness
ofprice.
“Idon’t think 1canstopyounow,” hesaid, “ifyou’ve made your
choice. But ifthere’s onechance lefttostop you. it’sachance I
have totake.”
Sheshook herhead slowly. “There isn’t.And—what for,Fran-
cisco? You’ve given up.What difference docs itmake toyouwhether
Iperish with therailroad oraway from it?”
“Ihaven’t given upthefuture.”
“What future?”
“The daywhen thelooters willperish, butwewon’t.”
“ItTaggart Transcontinental istoperish with thelooters, then so
am1.”
Hedidnottake hiseyes otfherfaceandhedidnotanswer.
Sheadded dispassionately, “Ithought Icould livewithout it. i

“Inorder tomaintain thelooters’ world?”
“Inorder tomaintain the laststrip ofmine”

Hedosed hiseyes foraninstant, andthetightening movement of

“Yes.”
“All right, Dagny. Iwon’t trytostop you.Solong asyou still

“Francisco!” Itwasacryofastonishment anddespair. “You do
understand it,youknow what Imean bythatkind ofman,yousee

“Oh yes,” hesaidsimply, casually, looking atsome point inspace
within theroom, almost asifhewere seeing arealperson. Headded,
“Why should youbeastonished? You said thatwewere ofhiskind

“Yes,” shesaid sternly, “one ofushas.Wecannot serve him

“Wecannot serve himbymaking terms with hisdestroyers.”
“I'm notmaking terms with them. They needmeTheyknow it.
It'smyterms that i'llmake them accept.”
“Byplaying agame inwhich they gain benefits inexchange for

“If 1cankeep Taggart transcontinental mexistence, it'stheonly

Hesmiled. “Doyou think so?Doyouthink that theiineed of

Hewaslooking ather. asifhewere seeing herbody asshestood
before him,evenChough hiseyeswere directed atherface,and his
i1lance toldherwhatform ofatonement andsurrender hewasseeing

thatshehadnotseen hisglance orunderstood it,hissilent struggle,
betrayed bythetension ofalewmuscles under theskinofhisface—

you'll struggle tosaveTaggart Transcontinental. Iwillbeworking

reasons. Nowyoumayhateme— as.from your stand, youshould."
Sheraised herhead alittle, there wasnoperceptible change in
herposture, itwasnomore than herawareness ofherownbody
andofitsmeaning tohim, butforthelength ofonesentence she
stood asawoman, thesuggestion ofdefiance coming onlyfrom the
faintly stressed spacing ofherwords: “And what will itdotoyou?"
Helooked ather, infullunderstanding, butneither admitting nor
denying theconfession shewanted totearfrom him."That isno
one's concern butmine," heanswered.
Itwasshewhoweakened, butrealized, while saying it,that this
was stillmore cruel: "Idon't hate you. I’ve tried to.loryears, but
1never will,nomatter whatwedo,either oneofus."
“Iknow it,"hesaid, hisvoice low,sothatshedidnothear the
pain, but felt itwithin herself asitbydirect reflection from him.
“Francisco!" shecried, indesperate defense ofhimagainst herselt.
“How canyoudowhat you're doing?"
“Bythegrace ofmylove"— foryou, said hiseyes— “for theman,"
said hisvoice,“who didnotperish inyour catastrophe andwho will
never perish."
Shestood silently stillloramoment, asifinrespectful acknow-
ledgment.
“Iwish Icould spare youwhat you’re going togothrough." he
said, thegentleness ofhisvoice saying: It’snotmethatyoushould
pity.“But 1can't. Every one ofushastotravel thatroadbyhis
own steps. But it’sthesame road"
“Where does itlead?"
Hesmiled, asifsoftly closing adoor onthequestions thathe
would notanswer. “To Atlantis," hesaid,
“What?" sheasked, startled.
“Don’Uyou remember?—thelostcitythatonly thespirits otheroes
canenter."
Theconnection that struck hersuddenly hadbeen struggling in
hermind since morning, likeadimanxiety shehadhadnotime to
identify. Shehadknown it,butshehadthought only othisown fate
and hispersonal decision, shehadthought ofhim asacting alone.
Now sheremembered awider danger andsensed thevast,undefined
shape oftheenemy shewas facing.
“You’re oneofthem," shesaid slowly, “aren’t you?"
“Ofwhom?”
“Was ityou inKenDanagger’s office?"
Hesmiled. “No," Butshenoted thathedidnotaskwhat she
meant.
“Isthere—youwould know it— isthere actually adestroyer loose
intheworld?"
“Ofcourse."
“Who isit?"
“You."
586
Sheshrugged; herfacewasgrowing hard.“Themenwho’ve quit,
arethey stillalive ordead?”
“They're dead— asfarasyou’re concerned. But there’s tohea
Second Renaissance intheworld. HIwait for it.”
“No!” Thesudden violence ofhervoice wasmpersonal answer
tohim, tooneofthetwothings hehadwanted hertohear inhis
words. “No, don’t wait forme!”
“I’llalways wait toryou,nomatter whatwedo,either oneofus.”
Thesound theyheard wastheturning ofakey inthelockofthe
entrance door.Thedooropened andHank Rearden came in.
Hestopped briefly onthethreshold, thenwalked slowly intothe
living room, hishand slipping thekeyinto hispocket.
Sheknew thathehadseen Francisco’s facebefore hehadseen
hers.Heglanced ather,buthiseyescame back toFrancisco, asif
thiswere theonly facehewasnowable tosee.
Itwas atFrancisco’s face thatshewasafraid tolook.The effort
shemade topullherglance along thecurve ofafewsteps teltasif
shewere pulling aweight beyond herpower. Francisco hadrisen to
hisfeet, asifintheunhurried, automatic manner ofad’Anconia
trained tothecode ofcourtesy. There wasnothing thatRearden
could see inhistaco. Butwhat shesaw in itwasworse than she
hadfeared.
“What areyoudoing here?” asked Rearden, inthetoneone
would usetoaddress amenial caught inadrawing rwm
“Iseethat Iha\enoright toaskyouthesame question,” said
ftancisco. Sheknew what effort wasrcquiied toachieve theclear,
toneless quality ofhisvoice. Hiseyes kept returning toRearden’s
lighthand, as itheweie stillseeing thekeybetween hisfingers.
“Then answer it.”saidRearden.
“Hank, anyquestions youwish toaskshould beasked ofme,”
shesaid.
Rearden didnotseem toseeorhear her.“Answer it”he
repeated
“There isonlyoneanswer which youwould have theright to
demand,” saidFrancisco, “so 1willanswer you that that isnotthe
reason ofmypresence here.”
“There isonlyonereason foryour presence inthehouse ofany
woman,” saidRearden. “And Imean, anywoman—asfarasyou're
concerned Doyouthink that 1believe itnow, thatconfession of
youis oranything youever said tome?”
“Ihave given yougrounds nottotrustme,butnone toinclude
MissTaggart.”
“Don't tellmethatyouhavenochance here, never hadandnever
will. 1know it.Butthat 1should findyouhereonthe (irst—”
“Hank, ifyouwish toaccuse me—”shebegan, butRearden
whirled toher.
“Ciod, no,Dagny, Idon’t! Butyoushouldn’t beseenspeaking to
him.Youshouldn't dealwithhim inanyway.Youdon’tknow him.
Idp.”Heturned toFrancisco. “What areyouafter? Areyouhoping
toinclude heramong your kind ofconquests or—”
587
“No!” Itwasaninvoluntary cryand itsounded futile, with its
passionate sincerity offered—toberejected—asitsonly proof.
‘'No?Then areyouhereonamatter ofbusiness? Areyousetting
atrap, asyoudidforme?What sortofdouble-cross areyouprepar-
ingforher?”
“Mypurpose . ..wasnot...amatter ofbusiness.”
“Then whatwas it?”
“Ifyou stillcare tobelieve me, lcan tellyouonly that itinvolved
no ..,betrayal ofanykind.”
“Doyouthink thatyoumay stilldiscuss betrayal, inmypresence?”
“Iwillanswer yousome day. 1cannot answer younow.”
“You don’t liketobereminded ofit,doyou?You've stayed away
frommesince, haven’t you?You didn’t expect toseemehere?You
didn’t want tofaceme?” Butheknew thatFrancisco waslacing him
asnooneelsedidthese days—hesawtheeyes held straight tomeet
his,thefeatures composed, without emotion, without defense orap-
peal, settoendure whatever wascoming—hesawtheopen, unpro-
tected lookofcourage—thiswasthefaceofthemanhehadloved,
themanwhohad sethimfreeofguilt—andhefound himself lighting
against theknowledge that thislace stillheld him,above allelse,
above hismonth ofimpatience forthesight ofDagny. ‘‘Why don’t
youdefend yourself, ifyouhave nothing tohide?Why areyouhere?
Whywereyoustunned toseemeenter?”
“Hank, stop it!”Dagny’s voice wasacry,andshedrew back,
knowing thatviolence wasthemostdangerous element tointroduce
into thismoment
Bothmenturned toher“Please letmebetheonetoanswer,”
Francisco said quietly.
“Itoldyou that 1hoped I'dnever seehimagain.” saidRcardcn.
“I'm sorry ifithastobehere. Itdoesn't concern you. butthere's
something hemust bepaid for.”
“Ifthat is ...your purpose,” Francisco saidwith effort, “haven't
you . ..achieved italready9”
“What's thematter?” Reardon's facewastro/en. Inslipsbarely
moving, buthisvoice hadthesound ofachuckle. “Isthisyourway
ofasking formercy?”
The instant ofsilence wasFrancisco's strain toagreater elfort.
“Yes . .ifyouwish.” heanswered
“Did yougram itwhen youheldmyfuture inyourhands?”
“You arejustified inanything youwish tothink ofme.Buisince
itdoesn't concern Miss Taggart . .would younowpermit meto
leave?”
“No!Doyouwant toevade it,like allthose other cowards’* Do
youwant toescape?”
“Iwillcome anywhere yourequire anytimeyouwish, feut [would
rather itwere not inMiss Taggart’s presence.”
“Why not? 1want ittobeinherpresence, since thi^ istheone
place youhadnoright tocome. Ihave nothing lefttoprotect from
you,you’ve takenmore than thelooters canever take, you’ve destroyed
everything you've touched, buthere isonething you’re notgoing to
588
touch.” Heknew that therigid absence ofemotion inFrancisco’s
facewasthestrongest evidence ofemotion, theevidence ofsome
abnormal effort atcontrol—heknew that thiswastorture andthat
he,Rearden, wasdriven blindly byafeeling which resembled ator-
turer’s enjoyment except thathewasnowunable totellwhether he
wastorturing Francisco orhimself. “You’re worse than thelooters,
because youbetray with fullunderstanding ofthatwhich you’re be-
traying. 1don’tknow what form ofcorruption isyour motive—but
1wantyou tolearn thatthere arethings beyond your reach, beyond
your aspiration oryour malice.”
“You have nothing ...tofearfromme ,.,now.”
“Jwantyou tolearn thatyouarenottothink ofher,nottolook
ather,nottoapproach her.Ofallmen, it’syouwhoYenottoappear
inherpresence.” Heknew that liewasdriven byadesperate anger
athisown leeling forthisman, thatthefeeling still lived, that itwas
thistceling which hehadtooutrage anddestroy. “Whatever your
motive, it’sfromanycontact withyouthatshehastobeprotected.”
if 1gaveyoumyword—”Hestopped.
Rearden chuckled, “iknow what theymean, your words, your
convictions, your friendship andyour oathbytheonlywoman you
ever—”Hestopped. They allknew what thismeant, inthesame
instant thatRearden knew it.
Hemade asteptoward Francisco: heasked, pointing atDagny,
Insvoice lowandstrangely unlike hisown voice, asifitneither came
tiom norwere addressed toaliving person, “Isthisthewoman
>oulove?”
Francisco closed hiseyes.
“Don't askhimthat!” ThecrywasDagny’s.
isthisthewoman youlove?”
Francisco answered, looking ather,“Yes.”
Rearden ’shand rose, sweptdown andslapped Francisco’s face.
Thescream came fromDagny When shecould seeagain— after
aninstant that feltasiftheblowhadstruck herowncheek—Francis-
co’shands were the firstthing shesaw. llic heir oithed’Anconias
stood thrown back against atable, clasping theedgebehind him,not
tosupport himself, buttostop hisown hands. Shesawtherigid
stillness ofhisbody, abody thatwaspulled toostraight butseemed
broken, with theslight, unnatural angles ofhiswaistline andshoul-
ders, with hisarms held stiffbutslanted back—hestood asifthe
effort nottomove were turning theforce ofhisviolence against
himself, asifthemotion heresisted were running through hismus-
clesasatearing pain. Shesaw hisconvulsed Fingers struggling to
gmw fasttothetable’s edge, shewondered which would break first,
thewood ofthetable orthebones oftheman,andsheknew that
Rearden's lifehung inthebalance.
When hereyesmoved uptoFrancisco’s face, shesawnosignof
struggle, only theskinofhistemples pulled tightandtheplanes of
hischeeks drawn inward, seeming faintly more hollow than usual. It
made hisfacelook naked, pureandyoung. She feltterror because
shewasseeing inhiseyes thetearswhich were notthere. Hiseyes
were brilliant and dry.Hewaslooking atRearden, but itwasnot
589
Reardenthathewasseeing. Helooked asifhewere facing another
presence intheroom andasifhisglance were saying: Ifthis iswhal
youdemand ofme.theneven this isyours, yours toaccept andmine
toendure, there isnomore than this inmetooffer you,hut letme
beproud toknow that 1canoffer somuch. Shesaw—with asingle
artery beating under theskinofhisthroat, with afroth ofpink in
thecorner ofhismouth—thelookofanenraptured dedication which
wasalmost asmile, andsheknew thatshewaswitnessing Francisco
d’Anconia’s greatest achievement.
When she feltherself shaking andheard herown voice, itseemed
tomeet the lastecho ofherscream intheairoftheroom— andshe
realized how biief amoment hadpassed between. Hervoice hadthe
savage sound ofrising todeliver ablowand itwascrying toRearden:
"—toprotect mefromhaulLong before youever—”
"Don’t!"' Francisco’s head jerked toher,thebriefsnap ofhisvoice
held allofhisunreleased violence, andsheknew itwasanorder
thathadtobeobeyed.
Motionless butfortheslowcurve ofhishead, Francisco turned to
Rearden. Shesaw hishands leave theedge ofthetable andhang
relaxed byhissides. ItwasRearden thathewasnow seeing, and
there wasnothing inFrancisco’s faceexcept theexhaustion ofeffort,
butRearden knew suddenly howmuch thismanhadloved him.
“Within theextent ofyour knowledge,” Francisco said quietly,
"you areright.”
Neither expecting norpermitting ananswer, heturned toleave.
Hebowed toDagny, inclining hishead inamanner thatappeared
asasimple gesture ofleaving-taking toRearden, asagesture of
acceptance toher.Then heleft.
Rearden stood looking after him,knowing—without context and
with absolute certainty—thathewould give his lifeforthepowet
nottohavecommitted theaction hehadcommitted.
When heturned toDagny, hisfacelooked drained, open and
faintly attentive, asifhewere notquestioning herabout thewords
shehadcutoff,butwere waiting forthem tocome.
Ashudder ofpityranthrough herbodyandended inthemove-
ment ofshaking herhead: shedidnotknow forwhich ofthetwo
menthepitywasintended, but itmade herunable tospeak andshe
shook herhead overandover again, asiftrying desperately tone-
gatesome vast, impersonal suffering thathadmade them all its
victims.
"Ifthere’s something thatmust besaid, say it.”Hisvoice was
toneless.
Thesound shemade washalf-chuckle, half-moan—itwasnota
desire forvengeance, butadesperate sense ofjustice thatdrove the
cutting bitterness ofhervoice, asshecried, consciously throwing the
words athisface,"You wanted toknow thename 0fthatother
man? Theman Islept with? ThemanwhohadmeJfirst? Itwas
Francisco d’Anconia!”
Shesawtheforce oftheblowbyseeing hisfaceswept blank. She
knew that ifjustice washerpurpose, shehadachieved it—because
thisslapwasworse than theonehehad dealt.
590
She feltsuddenly calm, knowing lhatherwords hadhadtohe
said forthesake ofallthree ofthem. Thedespair ofahelpless
victim lefther,shewasnotavictim anylonger, shewasoneofthe
contestants, willing tobear theresponsibility ofaction. Shestood
facing him, waiting foranyanswer hewould choose togive her,
feeling almost asifitwere herturn tobesubjected toviolence.
Shedidnotknow whatform oftorture hewasenduring, orwhat
hesawbeing wrecked within himandkept himself theonlyoneto
seeThere wasnosignofpain togiveheranywarning; helooked
asifhewere justamanwhostood still inthemiddle ofaroom,
making hisconsciousness absorb afact that itrefused toabsorb.
Then shenoticed thathedidnotchange hisposture, thateven his
hands hung byhissides with thelingers half-bent astheyhadbeen
loralong time, itseemed toherthatshecould feeltheheavy numb-
ness attheblood stopping inhisfingers—and thiswastheonly clue
tohissuffering shewasable tofind, but ittoldherthat thatwhich
hefelt lelthimnopower toteelanything else,noteven theexistence
olhisown body. She waited, her pity vanishing andbecoming
iespect.
Then shesaw hiseyesmove slowly from herfacedown thelength
ofherbody, andsheknew thesoiloftorture hewasnowchoosing
toexperience, because itwasaglance ofanature hecould nothide
Irom her.Sheknew thathewasseeing herasshehadbeen atseven-
teen, hewasseeing herwith therivalhehated, hewasseeing them
together astheywould benow, asight hecould neither endure nor
icsist. Shesawtheprotection ofcontrol dropping from hisface, hut
liedidnotcarewhether helethersee hisface alive andnaked,
because therenowwasnothing toicad initexcept anunrevealing
violence, some partofwhich resembled hatred.
Heseized hershoulders, andshe feltprepared toaccept thathe
would now killherorbeat herinto unconsciousness, andmthe
moment when she feltcertain thathehadthought ofit,she felther
bodythrown against himandhismouth falling onhers,more brutally
thantheactotabeating would have permitted.
Shetound herself, interror, twisting herbody toresist, and. in
exultation, twisting herarms around him, holding him. letting her
lipsbring blood tohis,knowing thatshehadnever wanted himas
shedidinthismoment.
When hethrew herdown onthecouch, sheknew, totherhythm
oftheheat ofhisbody, that itwastheactofhisvictory over his
rivalandofhissurrender tohim, theactofownership brought to
unendurable violence bythethought ofthemanwhom itwasdefy-
ing.theactoftransforming hishatred forthepleasure thatmanhad
known into theintensity ofhisown pleasure, hisconquest ofthat
manbymeans ofherbody—she feltFrancisco’s presence through
Kearden's mind, she feltasifshewere surrendering tobothmen,
tothatwhich shehadworshipped inboth ofthem, thatwhich they
held incommon, thatessence ofcharacter which hadmade ofher
love foreach anactofloyalty toboth. Sheknew also that thiswas
hisrebellion against theworld around them, against itsworship of
degradation, against thelongtorment ofhiswasted daysandlightless
591
struggle—thiswaswhat hewished toassert and,alone withherin
thehalf-dark nesshigh inspace above acityofruins, tohold asthe
lastofhisproperty.
Afterwards, they lay still, hisfaceonhershoulder. The reflection
ofadistant electric signkept beating infaint flashes ontheceiling
above herhead.
Hereached forherhandandslipped herfingers under hisface to
lethismouth restagainst herpalm foramoment, sogently thatshe
felthismotive more than histouch.
After awhile, shegotup,shereached foracigarette, lighted it,
then held itouttohimwith aslight, questioning liftofherhand; he
nodded, still sitting half-stretched onthecouch; sheplaced theciga-
rettebetween hislipsandlighted another forherself. She feltagreat
sense ofpeace between them, andtheintimacy oftheunimportant
gestures underscored theimportance ofthethings theywere not
saying toeach other. Everything was said, shethought—butknew
that itwaited tobeacknowledged.
Shesaw hiseyesmove totheentrance dooronce inawhile and
remain on itforlongmoments, asifhewere stillseeing theman
whohad left.
Hesaid quietly, “Hecould have beaten mebyletting mehave
thetruth, anytimehewished. Why didn’t he?'*
Sheshrugged, spreading herhands inagesture ofhelpless sadness,
because theybothknew theanswer. Sheasked, “He didmean a
great deal toyou. didn’t he?”
“Hedoes.”
Thetwodots offire atthe tipsoftheir cigarettes hadmoved
slowly tothetipsoftheir fingers, withthesmall glow ofanoccasional
flareandthesoftcrumbling ofashes assolemovement inthesilence,
when thedoorbell rang.Theyknew that itwasnottheman they
wished butcould nothope toseereturn, andshefrowned with sud-
denanger asshewent toopen thedoor. Itlook heramoment to
remember thattheinnocuously courteous figure shesawbowing to
herwith astandard smile ofwelcome wastheassistant manager of
theapartment house.
“Good evening. Miss Taggart. We're soglad toseeyouback. I
justcame ondutyandheard thatyouhadreturned andwanted to
greetyou inperson.”
“Thank you.” Shestood atthedoor, notmoving toadmit him.
“Ihave aletter thatcame foryouabout aweek ago.MissTag-
gart,” hesaid, reaching into hispocket. “Itlooked asifitmight be
important, butbeing marked personal,’ itwasobviously not in-
tended tobesent toyour office and, besides, they didnotknow
yom address, either—sonotknowing where toforward it, Ikept it
inoursafeand Ithought I’ddeliver ittoyou inpersori.”
Theenvelope hehanded toherwasmarked: Registered—Air
Mail—Special Delivery—Personal. Thereturn address sfcid:Quentin
Daniels, Utah Institute ofTechnology, Afton, Utah.
“Ob .. .Thank you.”
The assistant manager noted thathervoice wentdropping toward
awhisper, thepolite disguise foragasp, henoted th$tshestood
592
looking down atthesender’s namemuch longer thanwasnecessary,
soherepeated hisgood wishes anddeparted.
Shewastearing theenvelope open asshewalked toward Rearden,
andshestopped inthemiddle oftheroom toread theletter. Itwas
typewritten onthinpaper—hecould seetheblack rectangles ofthe
paragraphs through thetransparent sheets—andhecould seeher
faceasshereadthem.
Heexpected it,bythetime hesawhercome totheend: she
leaped tothetelephone, heheard theviolent whirl ofthedialand
hervoice saying withtrembling urgency, “Long-distance, please ...
Operator, getmetheUtah Institute ofTechnology atAfton, Utah!”
Heasked, approaching. “What isit?”
Sheextended theletter, notlooking athim,hereyes fixedonthe
telephone, asifshecould force ittoanswer.
The letter said:
Dear Miss Taggart:

ment youcould offer me.because 1have usedthem all

Iknow that ifwesucceed, they willbeonly tooeager

pect, w'ehave toaccept theposition ofcriminals, youand
I,and liveunder thethreat ofbeing arrested atanymo-
ment attheir whim. And this isthething that 1cannot

Totellyouthefulltruth, 1want tosucceed, tosolve the

When helooked upfrom the letter, heheard hersaying, ashe
hadheard herthrough thewords ofthetypewritten lines, hervoice
rising closer todespair each time:
“Keep ringing. Operator! . . .Please keep ringing!'
“What canyou tellhim?” heasked. “There arenoarguments

“Iwon’t have achance totellhim! He'sgone bynow. Itwasa

“Who gothim?”
“Yes. Operator, I’llhold the line,keep trying!”

“Ifwe're free . .

“Yes. Iknow,”

Sheheld thereceiver pressed toherear,herarm stiffwith the
effort nottotremble. Shewaited, andheheard, inthesilence, the
futile clicking oftheunanswered call.
“He’s gone,” shesaid“They gothim.Aweek ismuch longer

Shebroke offonagasp;hesawthechange inherfacethemoment
before heheard theclick ofadistant receiver being lifted andthe
sound ofaman’s voice saying, across thewire. “Hello?”
“Daniels! Isthatyou? You’re alive? You’re stillthere 7”
“Why, yes. Isthisyou.MissTaggart? What’s thematter 7”
“I .1thought youwere gone.”
“Oh, I'msorry. Ijustheard thephone ringing. Iwasout inthe

“Carrots?” Shewaslaughing with hysterical relief.
“Ihavemyownvegetable patch outthere. Used tobethe Insti-

“Yes. Ijustreceived your letter. Justnow. I... Ihadbeenaway.”
“Oh.” There wasapause, thenhesaid quietly, “There's really

“Tell me,arcyougoing away?”

“About leaving.”

“1don’t wantyou todothat.Miss Taggart. Idon’t wantyou to

“I’m leaving forUtah atonce. Tonight. But there’s onething I

“Unless you die,you willwait formenomatter what happens?”
“Ofcourse.”
“Doyougivemeyourword that you’ll wait?”
“Yes, Miss Taggart.”
“Thank you.Good night.”
“Good night. Miss Taggart.”
Shepressed thereceiver down andpicked itupagain inthesame
sweep ofherhandandrapidly dialed anumber.
“Eddie? ...Havethem hold theComet forme. ...Yes, tonight’s
Comet. Give orders tohavemycarattached, thencome here, tomy

Shehungupandturned toRearden.
“Tonight?” hesaid.
“Ihave to.”
“Iguess so.Don't youhave togotoColorado, anyway0”
“Yes. Iintended toleavetomorrow night. But 1think Eddie can
manage totake care ofmyoffice, and I’dbelter start now'. Ittakes

“How long willyoustay inColorado?”
“Hard totell.”
“Wire finewhen yougetthere, willyou? Ifitlooks asifit’sgoing

Thiswastheonly expression hecould give tothewords hehad
desperately wished tosaytoher,hadwaited for,hadcome here to
say.andnowwished topronounce more than ever, butknew that it
must notbesaid tonight.
Sheknew, byafaint, solemn stress inthetone ofhisvoice, that
thiswas hisacceptance ofherconfession, hissurrender, hisforgive-
ness.Sheasked, “Can youleave themills?”
“Itwilltakemeafewdays toarrange, but Ican.”
Heknew what herwords were admitting, acknowledging and for-
giving him,when shesaid,“Hank, whydon’t youmeetmeinColo-
rado inaweek? Ifyou flyyour plane, we’ll both getJhere atthe
same time.And then we’llcome back together.”
“All right . ..dearest.”

"Don’t hesitate tocall, ifyouhave to.”
"Okay. But 1don't think I’llhave to.”
"We’ll manage. Wellwork bylong-distance phone, justaswedid

"-when wewere building theJohn GaltLine?” heasked quietly.
Theyglanced ateach other, butsaidnothing else.

"Everything’s under way. Igotword, justafteryou lefttheoffice,

"Oh,wefinally found aman toputincharge atElgin,” hesaid,
forcing hisvoice tosound confident. “Don't worry, thetrack willbe

Sheglanced athimwith thefaint suggestion ofasmile, thinking
othowoften shehadsaidthese words tohimandofthedesperate
bravery withwhich hewasnow trying totellher:Don’t worry. He
caught herglance, heunderstood andtheanswering hintofhissmile

Heturned back tohisnote pad, feeling anger athimself, sensing

thought; heshould nothave saidanything toremind them both of
thedespair theywould feel, ifthey felt.Hewondered whatwasthe

Heknew whatwaswrong withhim,hethought; hedidnotwant her
toleave, hedidnotwant toloseheragain, after sobrief amoment
ofreunion. Buttoindulge anypersonal loneliness, atatimewhen
heknewhowdesperately therailroad needed herinColorado, was
anactofdisloyalty hehadnever committed before—andhefelt a
vague, desolate sense ofguilt.
‘'Send outorders that theComet istostop atevery division

Heglanced up—then hisglance stopped andhedidnothear the

“Forget it.Don’t youseethatthere isn’tanylaw lelt?Anything

When shewasready, heearned hersuitcase toataxicab, then
down theplalfoim oftheTaggart Terminal toheroffice car.thelast
attheendoftheComet Hestood ontheplatform, sawthetrain
jerkforward andwatched theredmarkers ontheback ofhercar
slipping slowly away fromhim into thelong darkness oftheexit
Uinnel. When theywere gone, hefeltwhatone leels atthelossof
adream onehadnotknown tillalter itwas lost.
There were tewpeople ontheplatform around himandthey
seemed tomove with self-conscious strain, asifasense ofdisaster
dung tothe railsandtothegirders above their heads. Hethought
mditferentlY that utter acentury ofsafety, menwere oncemore
regaiding thedeparture ofatram asanevent involving agamble
withdeath.
Heremembered thathehadhadnodinner, andhefeltnodesire
tocat.buttheunderground cafeteria ottheTaggart Terminal was
more truly hishome than theempty cube ofspace henowthought
ofashisapartment— sohewalked tothecafeteria, because hehad
noother place togo.
Thecafeteria wasalmost deserted—butthe firstthing hesaw, as
heentered, wasathincolumn ofsmoke rising from thecigarette of
theworker, who satalone atatable inadark corner
Notnoticing whatheputonhistray.Eddie earned ittothework-
er'stable, said, “Hello,” satdown andsaidnothing else.Helooked
atthesilverware spread before him,wondered about itspurpose,
lemembered theuseofaforkandattempted toperform themotions
ofeating, butfound that itwasbeyond hispower. After awhile, he
looked upandsaw that theworker’s eyes were studying him
attentively.
“No,” saidEddie, “no, there’s nothing thematter withme. . .,

Heremained silent andhewondered whytheworker’s eyes—the
eyes thatalways seemed toseeeverything within him—made him
feeluneasy tonight. Heglanced down atthetable, andhenoticed
thebutts ofmany cigarettes among theremnants offoodonthe

Chapter XTHESIGNOFTHEDOLLAR
Shesatatthewindow ofthetrain, herheadthrown back, notmov-
ing,wishing shewould never have tomove again.
The telegraph poles went racing past thewindow, butthetrain
seemed lost inavoid,between abrown stretch ofprairie andasolid
spread ofrusty, graying clouds. The twilight wasdraining thesky
without thewound ofasunset; itlooked more likethefading ofan
anemic body intheprocess ofexhausting itslastdrops ofblood and
Jight.The trainwasgoing west, asifit,too.were pulled tofollow
thesinking raysandquietly tovanish from theearth. She sat still,
feeling nodesire toresist it.
Shewished shewould nothear thesound ofthewheels. They
knocked inaneven rhythm, every fourth knock accented—and it
601
seemed toherthatthrough therapid, running clatter ofsome futile
stampede toescape, thebeat oftheaccented knocks was likethe
steps ofanenemy moving toward some inexorable purpose.
Shehadnever experienced itbefore, thissense ofapprehension
atthesight ofaprairie, thisfeeling thatthe railwasonly afragile
thread stretched across anenormous emptiness, likeaworn nerve
ready tobreak. Shehadnever expected that she,whohad feltasif
shewere themotive power aboard atrain, would now sitwishing,
likeachild orasavage, that thistrainwould move, that itwould
notstop, that itwould getherthereontime—wishing it,notlikean
actofwill,butlikeaplea toadarkunknown.
Shethought ofwhat adifference onemonth hadmade. Shehad
seen itinthelaces ofthemen atthestations. The track workers,
theswitchmen, theyardmen, whohadalways greeted her,anywhere
along the line, their cheerful grins boasting thattheyknewwhoshe
was—hadnowlooked atherstonily, turning away, their faces wary
andclosed. Shehadwanted tocrytothem inapology. “It’s not I
who’vc done ittoyou!”—thenhadremembered thatshehad ac-
cepted itand thattheynowhadtheright tohate her. thatshewas
both aslaveand adriver ofslaves, andsowasevery human being
inthecountry', andhatred wastheonly thing thatmencouldnow
feelforoneanother.
Shehadfound reassurance, fortwodays,mthesight ofthecities
moving past herwindow -the factories, (hebridges, the electric
signs, thebillboards pressing down upon theroofs ofhomes—the
crowded, grimy, active, living conflux oftheindustrial East.
Butthecities hadbeen leftbehind. The trainwasnowdiving into
theprairies oiNebraska, the rattle ofitscouplers sounding asifit
were shivering with cold: Shesawlonely shapes thathadbeen farm-
houses inthevacant stretches thathadbeen fields. Butthegreat
burst ofenergy, intheEast, generations ago,hadsplattered bright
trickles to^run through theemptiness; some were gone, butsome
still lived. Shewas startled when the lights ofasmall town swept
across hercarand. vanishing, left itdaiker than ithadbeen before.
Shewould notmove toturnonthe light. She sat still,watching the
raretowns, Whenever anelectric beam went flashing briefly athei

Shesawthem astheywent by,written onthewalls ofmodest
structures, over sooted roofs, down slender smokestacks, onthe

agirlstepping out,herwhite dress blowing inthesummer wind—
sheshuddered lorthetwoofthem, thinking: 1can't look atyou, i

with tiers ofpaleblue light, theindustrial light sheloved, with the
silhouettes ofmachines initswindows andabillboard inthedarkness
above itsroof- andsuddenly herhead fellonherarm.andshesat
shaking, crying soundlessly tothenight, toherself, towhatever was
human inany living being: Don’t let itgo! .. .Don't let itgo! . ..
Shejumped toherfeetandsnapped onthe light. Shestood still,
lighting toregain control, knowing that suchmoments were her
greatest danger. The lights ofthetown were past, herwindow was
nowanempty rectangle, andsheheard, inthesilence, theprogres-
Monofthefourth knocks, thesteps oftheenemy moving on,notto
hehastened orstopped.
Indesperate need ofthesight ofsome living activity, shedecided
shewould notorder dinner inhercar,butwould gotothediner.
As ifstressing andmocking herloneliness, avoicecame hack toher
mind: “But youwould notruntrains iftheywere empty.” Forget
it!—shetold herself angrily, walking hastily tothedoor ofhercar.
Shewasastonished, approaching hervestibule, tohear thesound
ofvoices close by.Asshepulled thedoor open, sheheard ashout:
(let off,Goddamn you!"
Anaging tramp hadtaken refuge inthecorner ofhervestibule.
Hesatonthefloor, hisposture suggesting thathehadnostrength
lefttostand uportocareabout being caught. Hewaslooking at
theconductor, hiseyes observant, fully conscious, butdevoid ofany
reaction. The trainwasslowing down forabadstretch oftrack, the
conductor hadopened thedoor toacold gust ofwind, andwas
waving atthespeeding black void, ordering, “Get going! Getoffas

ITiere wasnoastonishment inthetramp’s face,noprotest, no
anger, nohope, helooked as ifhehadlong sinceabandoned any

Sheglanced attheconductor. Shesawnothing inhisfaceexcept
theblind malevolence ofpain, ofsome long-repressed anger that
broke outupon the firstobject available, almost without conscious-

Itwas thelaundered collar and thisgesture forthe lastofhis

There wasakind ofdignity inhismanner, thehonesty oftheopen

The lifeless indifference ofhiseyes didnotfully hide thattheyhad

Thetramp hadwatched hersilently, butwhen theporter departed,

Shesmiled. “What trouble?”
“You’re traveling withoneofthose railroad tycoons, aren't you?”
“No, alone.”
“Then you're thewifeofoneofthem?”
“No.”
“Oh.” Shesaw hiseffort atalook ofsomething likerespect, as

“No, notthat, cither. Iguess I’moneofthetycoons* myself. My

“Oh... Ithink I’veheard ofyou,ma’am—inthediddays.” It

amonth orayearorwhatever period oftimehadpassed since he

“Yes,” shesaid. “Iwas.”
Heshowed nosignofastonishment atthefactthatshehadchosen

“When didyougetaboard thetrain?” sheasked.
“Back atthedivision point, ma’am. Your door wasn’t locked.”
Headded, “1figured maybe nobody would noticeme tillmorning
onaccount of itbeing aprivate car.”
“Where areyougoing?”
“Idon’t know.” Then, almost asifhesensed that thiscould sound
toomuch likeanappeal forpity,headded, “Iguess fjustwanted
tokeepmoving till 1sawsome place thatlooked likethere might
beachance tofindwork there.” Thiswas hisattempt toassume the
responsibility ofapurpose, rather than tothrow theburden ofhis
aimlessness upon hermercy—anattempt ofthesame order ashis
shirt collar.
“What kind ofwork areyoulooking for?”
“People don’t look forkinds ofwork anymore, ma’am,” hean-
swered impassively. “They justlook forwork.”
“What sortofplace didyouhope tofind?”
“Oh . . .well .. .where there’s factories, Jguess”
“Aren't yougoing inthewrong direction forthat? Thefactories
arcintheEast.”
“No.” Hesaid itwith thefirmness olknowledge. “There areloo
many people intheEast.The factories aretoowellwatched. Ifig-
ured there might beabetter chance some place where there's fewer
people and lesslaw.”
“Oh, running away?Afugitive from thelaw,arcyou?”
“Not asyou’d mean itintheolddavs,ma’am. Butasthings are
now. Iguess Iam. Iwant towork.”
“What doyoumean?”
“There aren't anyjobsback East.And aman couldn’t giveyoua

can't getwork except through theUnification Board. TheUnification
Board hasagang ofitsown friends waiting inline forthejobs,
more friends than amillionaire’s gotrelatives. Well,me—1haven't

“Where didyouwork last?”
“I’ve beenbumming around thecountry for sixmonths— -no,

theraiders do—youknow, thegangs thatrove allthrough thecoun-

“Doyouthink that it'sanybetter intheWest?"’
“No. 1don’!.'1
“Then whyareyougoing there?”
“Because 1haven't tried itbefore. That’s allthere islefttotry.

Shethought suddenly ofthose modern college-infected parasites
whoassumed asickening airofmoral self-righteousness whenever
they uttered thestandard bromides about theirconcern forthewel-
fareofothers. Thetramp’s lastsentence wasoneofthemost pro-
foundly moral statements shehadever heard; buttheman didnot

dryly, asamatter offact.
“What partofthecountry doyoucome from?” sheasked.
“Wisconsin,” heanswered.
The waiter came m,bringing their dinner. He setatable and
courteously moved two chairs, showing noastonishment atthena-
tureoftheoccasion.
Shelooked atthetable; shethought thatthemagnificence ofa
world where mencould afford thetimeandtheeffortless concern
forsuch things asstarched napkins and tinkling icecubes, offered
totravelers along with theirmeals fortheprice ofafewdollars, was
aremnant oftheagewhen thesustenance otone's lifehadnotbeen
made acrime andameal hadnotbeen amatter ofrunning arace
with death—aremnant which wassoon tovanish, like thewhite

“What wasyour lineofwork—intheolddays?” sheasked, when
thewaiter left.“Factories, wasn’t it?”
“Yes,ma’am”
“What trade?”
“Skilled lathe -operator.'1
“Where didyouwork atitlast?”
“InColorado, ma’am. FortheHammond CarCompany”
“Oh ..r

“Did thathappen onevery jobyou’ve held?”
Heglanced ather,asifheunderstood herquestion. “No,ma’am.”

seeing some secret terror ofhisown, "themotors . . .were . ..

"What?”
“Meorabout sixthousand others.Wemight have. Ithinkwedid

“What doyoumean?”
“Well, there wassomething thathappened atthatplant where I

thought thatwewere supposed tothink itwasgood. Theplanwas

“What wasthename ofthefactory?” sheasked, hervoice barely
audible.
“The Twentieth Century Motor Company, ma'am, ofStarnes-
vifte, Wisconsin.”
607
“Goon.”
“We voted forthatplan atabigmeeting, with ailofuspresent,

They alllooked atherwithanairofinquiring expectation, asshe

“Isthereanyone herewhowishes tobespokesman forthepassen-

Dagny paused tolook ather*Thewoman waspushing forward,

"1hats true," saidDagny. i'dbetter havesomeone toaccompany

Shehadmisunderstood thewoman’s motive. There wasnoanswer.
There werenoglances directed atheroratoneanother. There were
noeyes—only moist ovals glistening inthemoonlight. There they

silence -ananger saying thatshewassupposed tospare themmo-

remained silent byconscious intention.
Shenoticed thatOwen Kellogg, too,waswaiting; huthewasnot

certain thatthere would benoanswer from thecrowd, hesaid qui-
etly, "I’llgowith you,ofcourse, Miss Taggart."
"Thank you."
"What about us?"snapped thenervous woman,
Dagny turned toher,answering intheformal, inflect tonless mono-
tone ofabusiness executive, "There havebeennocases ofraider
gang attacks upon frozen trains—unfortunately.”
"Just where arewe?" asked abulkyman with tooexpensive an

“Keep yourmouth shut." saidDagny, “or I’lllockthetraindoors

“—it Igiveyouatrain togetyouwithin sight orhearing ofyour

When they started outontheirway tothetrack phone, walking
pastthesilent lineofcars, theysawanother figure descending from
thetrainandhurrying tomeet them. Sherecognized thetramp.
"Trouble, ma'am?” heasked, stopping.
“Ihecrew hasdeserted.”
“Oh. What’s tobedone 7”
“I’m going toaphone tocallthedivision point.”
“You can't goalone, ma’am. Notthese days I'dbetter gowith

Shesmiled, “thanks. But I’llbeailright. Mr.Kellogg here isgoing
withme.Say—what’s yourname7”
“Jeff Allen, ma’am.”
“Iisten, Allen, have>oueveiworked forarailroad?”
“No,ma’am.”
“Well, you’re working foionenow. You're deputy-conductor and
proxy-vice-president incharge ofoperation. Your job istotake
charge olthis train inmyabsence, topreserve order and tokeep
thecattle from stampeding. Tellthem that Iappointed you.You
don'tneedanyproof. They’ll obeyanybody whoexpects obedience.”
“Yes, ma’am,” heanswered firmly, with alook ofunderstanding.
Sheremembered thatmoney inside aman's pocket hadthepower
toturn intoconfidence inside hismind; shetook ahundred-doilar
bill(rom herbagandslipped itinto hishand. “Asadvance on
wages,” shesaid.
“Yes. ma’am.”
Shehadstarted off,when hecalled after her,“Miss Taggart!”
Sheturned. “Yes?”
“Thank you,” hesaid.
Shesmiled, half-raising herhand inaparting salute, andwalked
on.
“Who isthat?” asked Kellogg.
“Atramp whowascaught stealing aride.”
“Hc*ll dothejob, lthink.”
“He will.”
Theywalked silently pasttheengine andoninthedirection ofits
623
headlight. At first, stepping from tietotie,with the.violent light
beating against them from behind, they still feltasiftheywere at
home inthenormal realm ofarailroad. Then shefound herself
watching thefightonthetiesunder herfeet,watching itebbslowly,
trying tohold it,tokeep seeing itsfading glow, until sheknew that
thehintofaglowonthewood wasnolonger anything butmoon-
light.Shecould notprevent theshudder thatmade herturn tolook
back.The headlight stillhung behind them, liketheliquid silvei
globe ofaplanet, deceptively close, butbelonging toanother orbit
andanother system.
Owen Kellogg walked silently beside her,andshe feltcertain that
theyknew each other’s thoughts.
“Hecouldn’t have.OhGod, hecouldn't!” shesaidsuddenly, not
realizing thatshehadswitched towords.
“Who?”
“Nathaniel Taggart. Hecouldn’t haveworked with people like
those passengers. Hecouldn’t have runtrains forthem.Hecouldn’t
haveemployed themHecouldn’t have usedthem atall,neither as
customers norasworkers.”
Kellogg smiled. “Youmean thathecouldn’t havegrown richby
exploiting them. MissTaggart?”
Shenodded. “They ..shesaid,andheheard thefainttrembling
ofhervoice, which wasloveandpainandindignation, “they’ve said
foryears thatherosebythwarting theability ofothers, byleaving
them nochance, andthat . ..thathuman incompetence wastohis
selfish interest. .. .Buihe ..itwasn’t obedience thatherequired

“Miss Taggart,” hesaid,withanoddnoteofsternness inhisvoice,
“justremember thatherepresented aaxle olexistence which -lor
abriefspan inallhuman history—drove slavery outofthecivilized
world. Remember it,when you feel baffled bythenature ofhis
enemies.”
“Have youeverheard ofawoman named IvyStarnes?”
“Oh yes.”
“Ikeep thinking that thiswaswhat shewould have enjoyed—the
spectacle ofthose passengers topight. Thiswaswhat she’s after. But
we—wecan’t fivewith it,youand I,canwe?Noonecan livewith
it.It’snotpossible tolivewith it.”
“What makes youthink that IvyStarnes's purpose isfife?”
Somewhere ontheedge ofhermind—like thewisps shesaw float-
ingontheedges oftheprairie, neither quite raysnorfognorcloud—
she feltsome shape which shecould notgrasp, half-suggested and
demanding tobegrasped.
Shedidnotspeak, and— likethelinksjof achain unrolling through
their silence—therhythm oftheir steps!went on,spaced tothe ties,
scored bythedry, swift beatofheelsohwood.
Shehadnothadtime tobeawate offeim,except asofaproviden-
tialcomrade-in-competence: nowsheglanced athimwithconscious
attention. Hisfacehadtheclear, hard looksheremembered having
liked inthepast.Butthefacehadgrowh calmer, asifmore serenely
atpeace. Hisclothes were threadbare, tfeworeanoldleather jacket,
624
andeven inthedarkness shecould distinguish thescuffed blotches
streaking across theleather.
“What haveyoubeen doing sinceyou leftTaggart Transcontinen-
tal?” sheasked.
“Oh,many things.”
“Where areyouworking now?”
“On special assignments, more orless.”
“Ofwhat kind?”
“Ofevery kind.”
“YouTe notworking forarailroad?”
“No.”
Thesharp brevity ofthesound seemed toexpand itintoanelo-
quent statement. Sheknew thatheknew hermotive. “Kellogg, ifI
toldyou that Idon’t haveasingle first-rate man leftontheTaggart
system, if Ioffered youanyjob,anyterms, anymoney youcared to

“No.”

“You’re stillworking foraliving, aren’t vou?”
“Yes.”
“You don’tseem tobemaking verymuch”
“I’mmaking enough formyneeds -and fornobody else’s.”
"Why areyou willing towork foranyone butTaggart Trans-

"Because youwouldn't gnemethekind ofjob I’dwant.”
"P”Shestopped still.“Good God. Kellogg!—haven’t youunder-

“All right. Track walker”

"No?You see. Ismuyouwoutdn't.”

"Any timeyouoffered it.”
“But nothing better?”
"lhat’s right, nothing better.”
"Don’t youunderstand that Ihave loomanymenwho* reable to

“Iunderstand it.Miss Taggart, Doyou?”
“What Ineed isyour—”
“—mind. Miss Taggart? Mymind isnotonthemarket any
longer.”
625
Shestood looking athim,herfacegrowing harder. “You’re one
ofthem, aren’t you?” shesaid atlast.
“Ofwhom?”
Shedidnotanswer, shrugged andwent on.
“Miss Taggart,” heasked, “how long willyouremain willing to
beacommon carrier ?”
“Iwon’t surrender theworld tothecreature you’re quoting.”
“The answer yougave herwasmuch more icalistic,”
Thechain oftheir steps hadstretched through many silent minutes
before sheasked. “Why didyoustand bymetonight? Whywere
youwilling tohelpme?”
Heanswered easily, almost gaily, “Because there isn'tapassenger
onthat trainwhoneeds togetwhere he’sgoing more urgently than
1do. Ifthetram canbestarted, none will profit more than I.But
when lneed something, Idon’t sitandexpect transportation, like

“You don't? Andwhat ifalltrains stopped running?”
“ITien lwouldn't count onmaking acrucial journey bytrain.”
“Where areyougoing?”
“West.”
“On a‘special assignment”*”
“No. Foramonth's vacation withsome friends.”
“Avacation? And it’sthatimportant toyou?”
“More important than anything onearth”
Theyhadwalked twomileswhen theycame tothesmall graybox
onapostbythetraekside, which wastheemergency telephone. The
boxhung sidewise, beaten bystorms. Shejerked itopen.The tele-
phone was there, afamiliar, reassuring object, glinting mthebeam
ofKellogg’s flashlight. Butsheknew, themoment shepressed the
receiver toherear,andheknew, when hesawherlinger tapping
sharply against thehook, thatthetelephone wasdead.
Shehanded thereceiver tohimwithout aword. Sheheld the
flashlight, while hewent swiftly over theinstrument, then tore itoff
thewallandstudied thewires.
“The wire’s okay,” hesaid.“The current’s on. It’sthisparticular
instrument that’s outoforder. There’s achance thatthenextonemight
beworking.” Headded, “The nextone isfivemiles away.”
“Let’s go,”shesaid.
Farbehind them, theengine’s headlight was still visible, not a
planet anylonger, butasmall starwinking through mists ofdistance
Ahead ofthem, the railwent offintobluish space, with nothing to
mark itsend.
Sherealized howoften shehadglanced back atthatheadlight; so
long asitremained insight, shehad feltasifalife-line were holding
them anchored safely; now theyhadtobreak itanddive into . .
anddive offthisplanet, shethought. noticed thatKellogg, too,
stood looking back attheheadlight.
jThey glanced ateach other, butsa|d nothing. Thecrunch ofa
pebble under hershoe sole burst like'afirecracker inthesilence.
With acoldly intentional movement, hekicked thetelephone instru-
626
mentandsent itrolling intoaditch: theviolence ofthenoise shat-
tered thevacuum.
“God damn him/’ hesaid evenly, notraising hisvoice, with a
loathing pastanydisplay ofemotion. “Heprobably didn’t feel like
attending tohisjob,andsince heneeded hispaycheck, nobody had
theright toaskthathekeep thephones vnorder.”
“Come on/’ shesaid.
“We can rest, ifyou feel tired. Miss Taggart.”
“I’m allright.Wehavenotime tofeeltired.”
“That’S ourgreat error. Miss Taggart.Weought totake thetime,
some day.”
Shegave abrief chuckle, shestepped onto atieofthetrack,
stressing thestep asheranswer, andtheywent on.
Itwashard, walking onties, butwhen they tried towalk along
thetrackside, theyfound that itwasharder. ITie soil,half-sand, half-
dust, sankunder their heels, likethesoft, unresisting spread ofsome
substance thatwasneither liquid nor solid.Theywent back towalk-
ingfrom tietotic; itwasalmost likestepping from logtologinthe
midst ofariver.
Shethought ofwhat anenormous distance fivemileshadsuddenly
become, andthat adivision point thirty miles away wasnow unat-
tainable—afteraneiaofrailroads builtbymenwhothought inthou-
sands oftranscontinental miles. That netofrailsand lights, spreading
trom ocean toocean, hung onthesnap ofawire, onabroken
connection inside arusty phone—no,shethought, onsomething
muchmore powcrtul andmuch more delicate. Ithungontheconnec-
tions intheminds ofthemenwhoknew thattheexistence ofawire,
ofatrain, olajob, ofthemselves andtheir actions wasanabsolute
nottobeescaped. When suchminds were gone, atwo-thousand-ton
trainwas left atthemercy ofthemuscles ofher legs.
Fired? —she thought; even thestrain ofwalking was avalue, a
small piece ofreality inthestillness around them. Thesensation of
effort wasaspecific experience, itwaspainandcould benothing
else -inthemidst ofaspace which wasneither lightnordark, asoil
which neither gavenorresisted, afogwhich neither moved norhung
still.Their strain was theonly evidence oftheir motion: nothing
changed mtheemptiness around them, nothing tookform tomark
their progress. Shehadalways wondered, inincredulous contempt,
about thesects thatpreached theannihilation oftheuniverse asthe
ideal tobeattainted. There,shethought, was their world andthe
content oftheirminds made real.
When thegreen lightofasignal appeared bythetrack, itgave
them apoint toreach and pass, but—incongruous inthemidst of
thefloating dissolution —itbrought themnosense ofrelief, itseemed
tocome from along since extinguished world, likethose starswhose
lightremains after they aregone.Thegreen circle glowed inspace,
announcing aclear track, inviting motion where there wasnothing
tomove.Whowasthatphilosopher, shethought, whopreached that
motion exists without anymoving entities? Thiswas hisworld, too.
Shefound herself pushing forward with increasing effort, asif
against some resistance thatwas,notpressure, butsuction. Glancing
627
atKellogg, shesaw that he,too,waswalking likea.man braced
against astorm. She feltas ifthetwoofthem were thesole
survivors ...ofreality, shethought—twolonely figures fighting, not
through astorm, butworse: through non-existence.
IfwasKellogg whoglanced back, after awhile, andshefollowed
hisglance: therewasnoheadlight behind them.
TTiey didnotstop. Looking straight ahead, hereached absently
into hispocket; she fellcertain thatthemovement wasinvoluntary;
heproduced apackage ofcigarettes andextended ittoher.
Shewasabout totake acigarette—then, suddenly, sheseized his
wristandtore thepackage outofhishand. Itwasaplain white
package thatbore, assingle imprint, thesignofthedollar.
“Givemethe.flashlight!" sheordered, stopping.
Hestopped obediently andsentthebeam oftheflashlight atthe
package inherhands. Shecaught aglimpse ofhisface:helooked a
little astonished andveryamused.
There wasnoprinting onthepackage, notrade name, noaddress,
only thedollar signstamped ingold. Thecigarettes bore thesame
sign.
“Where didyougetthis?” sheasked.
Hewas smiling. “Ifyouknow enough toask that. Miss Taggart,
youshould know that Iwon’t answer.”
“Iknow that thisstands forsomething.”
“The dollar sign? Foragreat deal. Itstands onthevestofevery
fat,piglike figure inever> cartoon, forthepurpose ofdenoting a
crook, agrafter, ascoundrel -astheone sure-fire brand ofevil. It
stands—asthemoney ofafreecountry—forachievement, forsuc-
cess, forability, forman screative power —and. precisely forthese
reasons, itisused asabrand ofinfamy. Itstands stamped onthe
forehead ofaman likeHank Rearden, asamark ofdamnation
Incidentally, doyouknow where that signcomes from? Itstands for
the initials oftheUnited States.”
Hesnapped theflashlight off,buthedidnotmove togo;shecould
distinguish Ihehint ofhisbitter smile.
“Doyouknow thattheUnited States istheonlycountry inhistory
thathase\erused itsownmonogram asasymbol ofdepravity? Ask
yourself why.Ask yourself howlong acountry thatdidthatcould
hope toexist, andwhose moral standards have destroyed itItwas
theonlycountrymhistory where wealth wasnotacquired bylooting,
butbyproduction, notbyforce, butbytrade, theonlycountry whose

standards oftheworld, ifthis isthereason fordamning us,then

damned bythatworld.Wechoose towjear thesign olthedollar on
ourforeheads, proudly, asourbadge ofnobility— thebadge wcare
willing toliveforand. ifneed be,todife.”
Heextended hishand forthepackagd. Sheheld itasifherlingers
would not let itgo,butgaveupandplaced itonhispalm. With
deliberate slowness, asiftounderscore themeaning ofhisgesture,
heoffered heracigarette. Shetook ifandplaced itbetween her
628
lips.Hetookoneforhimself, struck amatch, lighted bothandthey
walked on.
They walked, over rotting logs thatsank without resistance into
theshifting ground, through avast,uncongealed globe ofmoonlight
andcoiling mist—withtwospots ofliving fireintheirhands andthe
glow oltwosmall circles tolight their faces.
“Fire, adangerous force, tamed athisfingertips .sheremem-
bered theoldman saying toher,theoldmanwhohadsaid that
these cigarettes were notmade anywhere onearth.“When aman

“1wishyou’d tellmewhomakes them,” shesaid, inthetone of
ahopeless plea.
Hechuckled good-naturedly. “Ican tellyou thismuch: they’re
made byafriend ofmine, forsale, but—notbeing acommon ear-
lier—hesellsthem only tohisfriends."'
“Sellmethatpackage, willyou?”
“Idon't think you’ll beable toafford it,Miss Taggart, but— all
right, ifyouwish.”
“How much isit?”
“Five cents.”
“Five cents?” cherepeated, bewildered.
“Five cents--”hesaid,andadded, “ingold.”
Shestopped, staring athim.“Ingold?”
“Yes, Miss Taggart.”
“Well, what's your rale ofexchange9Howmuch isitinournor-
malmoney?”
“There isnorateofexchange. Miss Taggart. Noamount ofphysi-
cal—orspiritual-— currency, whose solestandard ofvalue isthede-
cree ofMr.Wesley Mouch, willbuythese cigarettes.”
“Isee.”
Hereached into hispocket, took outthepackage andhanded it
toher. “I’ll givethem toyou. Miss Taggart.” hesaid, “because
you’ve earned themmany times over- -andbecause youneedthem
foithesame purpose wedo.”
“What purpose?”
“Toremind us—inmoments ofdiscouragement, intheloneliness
olexile—ofourtruehomeland, which hasalways been yours, too,
MissTaggart.”
“Thank you,” she said.Sheputthecigarettes inherpocket; he
sawthatherhandwastrembling.
When theyreached thefourth ofthefivemileposts, theyhadbeen
silent foralong time, withnostrength leftforanything buttheeffort
ofmoving their feet.Farahead, theysawadotoflight, toolowon
thehorizon andtooharshly clear tobeastar.They keptwatching
it,astheywalked, andsaidnothing until theybecame certain that
itwasapowerful electric beacon blazing inthemidst oftheempty
prairie.
“What isthat?” sheasked.
“Idon’t know,” hesaid. “Itlooks like—”
“No,” shebroke inhastily, “itcouldn’t be.Notaround here.”
629
Shedidnotwant tohearhimname thehope which "shehad felt
formany minutes past.Shecould notpermit herself tothink of it
ortoknow thatthethought washope.
They found thetelephone box atthe fifth milepost. Thebeacon
hung like aviolent spot ofcold tire, lessthan half amile farther
south.
Thetelephone wasworking. Sheheard thebuzz ofthewire, like
thebreath ofaliving creature, when she lifted thereceiver. Then a
drawling voice answered. “Jessup, atBradshaw.” The voice sounded
sleepy.
"This isDagnv Taggart, speaking from-"
“Who?’*
“Dagny Taggart, ofTaggart Transcontinental, speaking™"
-Oh. . .Ohyes... Isee . .Yes?”
“—speaking from your track phone Number 83.TheComet is

There wasapause. “Well, whatdoyouwantmetodoabout it9"
Shehad topausemturn, inorder tobelieve it.“Are youthe

”Yeah.”
“Then sendanother crew outtousatonce”
“A fullpassenger traincrew?”
“Ofcourse.”
“Now?”
“Yes.”
There wasapause. "The iules don't sayanything about that.”
“Getmethechief dispatcher,” shesaid, choking.
“He's away onhisvacation.”
“Get thedivision superintendent.”
“He’s gonedown toLaurel foracouple ofdays."
“Getmesomebody who’s incharge”
“I’m incharge.”
“Listen,'’ shesaidslowly, fighting forpatience, “doyouunderstand

“Yeah, buthowam ltoknow whatLmsupposed todoabout it?

“And what’s going tohappen ifyouleave atrain stalled onthe

“That's notmyfault Ihadnothing todowith it.They can’tblame

“You're tohelp itnow.”

We’re notsupposed tofurnish anyTaggart crews. Youpeople were

“But this isanemergency!”
“Nobody toldmeanything about anemergency.”
Shehadtotake afewseconds tocontrol herself. ShesawKellogg
watching herwith abitter smile ofamusement.
“Listen,” shesaid intothephone, “doyouknow' thattheComet
wasdue atBradshaw over three hours ago?”
“Oh, sure. Butnobody's going tomake anytrouble about that.
Notram’s everonschedule these days.”
‘‘Then doyouintend toleave usblocking your track forever**”
“We’ve gotnothing due tillNumber 4.thenorthbound passenger

“You blasted idiot! This istheComet'"
“What's thattome?This isn'tTaggart Transcontinental. Youpeo-

Hisvoice wasslipping intowhining insolence. “You can’t talktome
thatway. Thetime’s pastwhen youcould talktopeople thatway.”
Shehadnever believed thatthere were rnenwithwhom acertain
method, which shehadnever used,would work; suchmenwere not
hired byTaggart Transcontinental andshehadnever been forced to
dealwiththem before.
“Doyouknowwho lam?” sheasked, inthecold, oveibearing

Itworked. “I... Iguess so,”heanswered.
“Then letme tellyouthat ityoudon’t send acrew tomeatonce,

“Yes, ma’am.” Headded, “Will you tellheadquarters that itwas

“Iwill.”
“And that it’syouwho’re responsible forit?”
“Iam.”
There wasapause, then heasked helplessly. “Now howam I

“Doyouhave acallboy?”

“Yes, buthewon't gethere tillmorning/'
“Isthere anybody intheyards right now?’'

“Sothey’re going topickupMr.Kellogg, arcthey?”
Shewhirled tohim. realizing what decision hermind hadbeen

“There’s agood chance thatthey will.”
There were twoplanes ontheedge ofthe airfield: one. thehalf-
charred remnant ofawreck, notworth salvaging forscrap-the other,
aDwight Sanders monoplane, brand-new, thekindofship thatmen
were pleading for. invain, allover thecountry.
There wasonesleepy attendant attheairfield, young, pudgy, and.
butforafaint smell ofcollege about hisvocabulary, abrain-brother
ofthenight dispatcher ofBradshaw. Heknew nothing about thetwo
planes: theyhadbeen therewhen hefirsttook thisjobayear ago.
Hehadnever inquired about them andneither hadanybody else. In
whatever silent crumbling hadgoneonatthedistant headquarters, in
theslow dissolution ofagreat airline company, theSanders mono-
plane hadbeen forgotten—asassets ofthisnature were being forgot-
teneverywhere ...asthemodel ofthemotor hadbeen forgotten on
ajunk pileand, leftinplain sight, hadconveyed nothing totheinheri-
torsandthetakers-over. . ..
There were norules totelltheyoung attendant whether hewas
expected tokeep theSanders plane ornot.Thedecision wasmade
forhimbythebrusque, confident manner ofthetwostrangers—by
thecredentials ofMissDagny Taggart, Vice-President ofarailroad—
633
bybrief hintsabout asecret, emergency mission, which bounded tike
Washington tohim—bythemention ofanagreement withtheairline's
topofficials inNew York, whose names hehadnever heard before—
byacheck forfifteen thousand dollars, written byMiss Taggart, as
deposit against thereturn oftheSanders plane—andbyanother
check, fortwohundred bucks, forhisown, personal courtesy.
Hefueled theplane, hechecked itasbesthecould, hefound a
map ofthecountry's airports—andshesaw thatalanding fieldon
theoutskirts ofAlton. Utah, wasmarked asstill inexistence. Shehad
been tootensely, swiftly active tofedanything, butatthe lastmo-
ment, when theattendant switched onthefloodlights, when shewas
about toclimb aboard, shepaused toglance attheemptiness ofthe
sky,then atOwen Kellogg. Hestood, alone inthewhite glare, his
feetplanted firmly apart, onanisland ofcement inaringofblinding
lights, withnothing beyond theringbutanirredeemable night-and
shewondered which oneofthem wastaking thegreater chance and
facing themore desolate emptiness.
“Incaseanything happens tome,” she said, “willyon tellEddie
Willers inmyoffice togive JeffAllen ajob,as Ipromised?’1
“1will . .Isthis allyouwish tobedone ... incaseanything
happens?”
Sheconsidered itandsmiled sadly, inastonishment attherealiza-
tion. “Yes, lguess that’s all . . .Except, tellHank Rearden what
happened andthat 1asked youtotellhim.”
“Iwill.”
She lifted herhead andsaid firmly, “Idon’t expect ittohappen,
however. When youreach Laurel, callWinston, Colorado, and tell
them that Iwillbethere tomorrow bynoon.”
“Yes, MissTaggart”
Shewanted toextend herhand inparting, but itseemed inadequate,
andthensheremembered what hehadsaidabout times ofloneliness
Shetook outthepackage and silently offered himoneofhisown
cigarettes. Hissmile wasafullstatement ofunderstanding, andthe
small flame ofhismatch lighting theirtwocigarettes was theirmost
enduring handshake.
rIben sheclimbed aboard—andthenextspan ofherconsciousness
wasnotseparate moments andmovements, butthesweep ofasingle
motion andasingle unitoftime, aprogression forming one entity,
likethenotes ofapiece ofmusic: from thetouch ofherhandonthe

tain rockslide, allcontact with thetimebehind her-tothecircling

over toolong astretch oftheworst mountain barrier —but itwasthe

Thestarswere likefoamandthesk\seemed fullofflowing motion,

Thepale streak olarivercame rising slowly from thevoid,andlor

When shesaw the lights ofatown, likeahandful ofgold coins
flungupon theprairie, thebrightly violent lights fedbyanelectric
current, theyseemed asdistant asthestarsandnow asunattainable.
Theenergy thathadlighted themwasgone, thepower thatcreated
power stations inempty prairies hadvanished, andsheknew ofno
journey torecapture it.Yetthese hadbeen herstars—shethought,
kxiking down—these hadbeen hergoal, herbeacon, theaspiration
drawing herupon herupward course. That which others claimed to
feel atthesight ofthestars— stars safely distant bymillions ofyears
andthusimposing noobligation toact,butserving asthe tinsel of
futility—shehad feltatthesight ofelectric bulbs lighting thestreets
ofatown, Itwas thisearth below thathadbeen theheight shewanted

Thesmall glass dialonherpanel showed thatshewasnowclimbing.
Thesound oftheengine, beating through themetal shellaround her,

There were stretches ofrestwhen themountains shrank down, over

Butshedidnotneed toseetheearth. Theinstrument panel was

“Can 1getacarsomewhere todrivemetotheInstitute ofTechnol-

Theattendant looked ather,puzzled. “Why, yes,1guess so,ma’ani.
But...butwhat for?There’s nobody there."
"Mr.Quentin Daniels isthere.”
Theattendant shook hishead slowly—thenjerked histhumb, point-

-What?''
"He just left.”
“Left? Why?”
“Hewent with themanwho flew inforhimtwo-three hours ago.”
"What man?"
"Don’t know, never sawhimbefore, but,boy!—he’s gotabeauty

Shewasback atthewheel, shewasspeeding down therunway, she

while shewas stillrepeating, "Oh no,they don't! They don’t! They

Aband oflightwas rising intheeastand itseemed tocome from
theeaith, asabreath long-held andreleased. Inthedeep blueabove
it,thestranger’s plane was asingle spark changing color andflashing
from side toside, liketheupolapendulum swinging inthedarkness,
beating time.
Thecurve ofdistance made thespark drop closer totheearth, and
shepushed herthrottle wide open, nottoletthespark outofher
sight,nottolet ittouch thehorizon andvanish. The lightwasflowing
intothesky.asifdrawn from theearth bythestranger’s plane. The
plane washeaded southeast, andshewasfollowing itintothecom-
ingsunrise.
From thetransparent green ofice,theskymelted intopale gold,
andthegoldspread intoalakeunder afragile filmofpink glass, the
color ofthatforgotten morning which wasthefu>tshehadseenon

Shekept hereyesonthestranger’s plane, asifherglance were a

towline pulling hership.The stranger's plane wasnow a*small black
cross, likeashrinking check mark ontheglowing sky.
Then shenoticed thattheclouds were notdropping, thattheystood
congealed ontheedge oftheearth—andsherealized thattheplane
washeaded toward themountains ofColorado, thatthestruggle against
theinvisible storm layahead forheronce more. Shenoted itwithout
emotion: shedidnotwonder whether hershiporherbody hadthe
power toattempt itagain. Solong asshewasable tomove, shewould
move tofollow thespeck thatwas fleeing away with the lastofher
world She feltnothing buttheemptiness leftbyatirethathadbeen
hatred andanger andthedesperate impulse ofafight tothe kill;these
hadfused into asingle icystreak, thesingle resolve tofollow the
stranger, whoever hewas,wherever hetook her,tofollow and ...she
added* nothing inhermind, butunstated, what layatthebottom of
theemptiness was:andgiveher life, ifshecould take his first.
Likeaninstrument settoautomatic control, herbodywasperforming
themotions ofdriving theplane— withthemountains reeling inabluish
fogbelow andthedented peaks rising inherpath assmoky formations
ofadeadlier blue.Shenoticed thatthedistance tothestranger’s plane
hadshrunk: hehadchecked hisspeed forthedangerous crossing, while
shehadgone on,unconscious ofthedanger, with only themuscles of
herarmsandlegsfighting tokeep herplane aloft.Abriet. tightmove-
ment ofher lipswasasdose asshecould cotnc toasmile: itwashe
whowas flying herplane forher,shethought; hehadgiven herthe
power tofollow himwithasomnambulist’s unerring skill.
As itresponding ofitself tohiscontrol, theneedle ofheraltimeter
wasslowly moving upward. Shewas rising andshewentonlising and
shewondered when herbreath andherpropeller would fail.Hewas
going southeast, toward thehighest mountains thatobstructed the
path ofthesun.
Itwas hisplane thatwasstruck bythe firstsunray. Itflashed for
aninstant, likeaburst ofwhite lire,sending rays toshoot from its
wings. Thepeaks ofthemountains came next: shesawthesunlight
reaching thesnow' inthecrevices, then trickling down thegranite
sides; itcutviolent shadows ontheledges andbrought themountains
intotheliving finality ofaform.
They were flying over thewildest stietch ofColorado, uninhabited,
uninhabitable, inaccessible tomenonfootorplane.Nolanding was

toward another, higher range. Shewondered whyhechose acourse

The stranger’s plane wassuddenly slacking itsspeed. Hewaslosing

was rising inhispath, moving tomeet fiim, reaching forhisWings,
butthelong,smooth lineofhismotion $yas sliding down. Shecould
detect nobreak, nojoit,nosignofmechanical failure: itlooked like
theevenmovement ofacontrolled intention. With asudden flash of
sunlight onitswings, theplane banked infoalong curve, raysdripping
638
likewater from itsbody—thenwent intothebroad, smooth circles of
aspiral, asifcircling foralanding where nolanding wasconceivable*
Shewatched, nottrying to*explain it,notbelieving what shesaw,
waiting fortheupward thrust thatwould throw himbackonhis
course. But theeasy, gliding circles went ondropping, toward a
ground shecould notseeanddared notthink of.Likeremnants of
broken jaws, strings ofgranite dentures stood between hershipand
his;shecould not tellwhat lay atthebottom ofhisspiral motion*
Sheknew only that itdidnotlook like, butwascertain tobe,the
motion ofasuicide.
Shesawthesunlight glitter onhiswings foraninstant. 7tten. like
thebody ofaman diving chest-first andarms outstretched, serenely
abandoned tothesweep ofthe fall,theplane wentdown andvanished
behind theridges ofrock.
Sheflew on,almost waiting for ittoreappear, unable tobelieve
thatshehadwitnessed ahorrible catastrophe taking place sosimply
and quietly. Sheflewontowhere theplane haddropped. Itseemed
tobeavalley inaringofgranite walls.
Shereached thevalley andlooked down. There wasnopossible
place foralanding. There wasnosignofaplane.
Thebottom ofthevalley looked likeastretch oftheearth’s crust
mangled inthedayswhen theearthwascooling, leftirretrievable ever
since. Itwasastretch ofrocks ground against oneanother, with boul-
dershanging inprecarious formations, with long, dark crevices anda
fewcontorted pine treesgrowing haIf-horizon tally intothe air.There
wasnolevel piece oisoilthesizeofahandkerchief There wasno
place foraplane tohide.There wasnoremnant ofaplane’s wreck.
Shebanked sharply, circling above thevalley, dropping down a
little.Bysome trick oflight, which shecould notexplain, thefloot of
thevalley seemed more clearly visible than therestoftheearth. She
could distinguish itwellenough toknow thattheplane wasnotthere;
yetthiswasnotpossible.
She circled, dropping down farther. Sheglanced around her—and
foronefrightening moment, shethought that itwasaquietsummer
morning, thatshewasalone, lost inaregion oftheRocky Mountains
which noplane should ever venture toapproach, and,with thelast
otherfuelburning away, shewaslooking foraplane thathadnever
existed,mquest ofadestioyer whohadvanished ashealways van-
ished; perhaps itwasonly hisvision thathad ledherhere tobe
destroyed. Inthenextmoment, sheshook herhead, pressed her
mouth tighter anddropped farther.
Shethought thatshecould notabandon anincalculable wealth such
asthebrain ofQuentin Daniels ononeofthose rocks below, ifhe
was still aliveandwithin herreach tohelp.Shehaddropped inside
thecircle ofthevalley’s walls. Itwas adangerous jobofflying, the
space wasmuch tootight, butshewentoncircling anddropping lower,
her lifehanging onhereyesight, andhereyesight flashing between two
tasks: searching thefloor ofthevalley andwatching thegranite walls
thatseemed about toripherwings.
Sheknew thedanger only itspart ofthejob. Ithadnopersonal
meaning anylonger. Thesavage thing she feltwasalmost enjoyment.
639
Itwasthelastrageofalost battle. No!—shewascrying inhermind,
crying ittothedestroyer, totheworld shehad left, totheyears
behind her,tothelongprogression ofdefeat—No! ...No! ...No! ...
Hereyesswept past theinstrument panel—andthen shesat still
butforthesound ofagasp.Her altimeter hadstood at11,000 feet
the lasttime sheremembered seeing it.Now itstood at10,000. But
thefloor ofthevalley hadnotchanged. Ithadcome nocloser. It
remained asdistant asher firstglance down.
Sheknew that thefigure 8,000 meant thelevel oftheground in
thispartofColorado, Shehadnotnoticed thelength ofherdescent.
Shehadnotnoticed thattheground, which hadseemed tooclearand
tooclose from theheight, wasnow toodimandtoo tar.Shewas
looking atthesame rocks from thesame perspective, theyhadgrown
nolarger, theirshadows hadnotmoved, andtheoddly unnatural light
stillhung over thebottom ofthevalley.
Shethought thatheraltimeter was off,andshewent oncircling
downward. Shesawtheneedle ofherdialmoving down, shesawthe
walls ofgranite moving up,shesawthering ofmountains growing
higher, itspeaks coming closer together inthesky— butthefloor of
thevalley remained unchanged, asifshewere dropping down awell
withabottom never tobereached. Theneedle moved to9,500— to
9300— to9,000—to8,700,
The flash oflight that hitherhadnosource. Itwasasiftheair

fire,sudden andsoundless, lireshock threw herback, herhands off

seized thewheel again, thelightwasgone, buthershipwasspinning,
herearswere bursting with silence andherpropeller stood stiffly
straight before her:hermotor wasdead.
She tried topull forarise,buttheshipwasgoingdown—andwhat
shesaw flying atherfacewasnotthespread ofmangled boulders, but
thegreen grass ofafieldwhere nofieldhadbeen before. There was
notime toseethe rest.There wasnotime tothink ofexplanations.
There W'asnotime tocome out ofthespin. Theearth was agreen

Flung from side toside, likeabattered pendulum, clinging tothe

ground waswhirling about her,sweeping above her,then below, its
spiral coilscoming closer. Heranus pulling atthewheel, withno

And inanswer totheearth thatflew tomeet her,sheheard inher

Thiswasherworld, shethought, thiswasthewaymeoweremeant

ofugliness andstruggle were onlysomeone’s senseless joke. She

“Wenever hadtotakeanyofitseriously, didwc?” shewhispered.
“No,wenever hadto.”
And then, herconsciousness returning fully, sherealized that this

Shetried todrawaway from him, but itwasonly ataintmovcmcnl

Ashotofpain across herback threw herdown again
“Don’t move. Miss Taggart. You’re hurt.”
“Youknowme?” Hervoicewasimpersonal andhard.
“I’veknown you formany years.”
“Have Iknown you?”
“Yes, 1think so.”
“What isyourname?”
“John Galt.”
Shelooked athim, notmoving.
“Why areyoufrightened?” heasked.
“Because 1believe it.”
Hesmiled, asifgrasping afullconfession ofthemeaning she
attached tohisname; thesmile heldanadversary’s acceptance ofa
challenge—andanadult’s amusement attheself-deception ofachild.
She feltasifshewere returning toconsciousness after acrash that
hadshattered more thananairplane. Shecould notreassemble the
pieces now, shecould notrecall thethings shehadknown about his

would slowly have tofill.Shecould notdo itnow, thismanwastoo
blinding apresence, likeaspotlight thatwould not letherseethe

“Was ityouthat 1wasfollowing?” sheasked.
“Yes.”
Sheglanced slowly around her.Shewas lying inthegrass ofa
field atthefootofagranite drop thatcamedown from thousands
offeetaway intheblue sky.Ontheother edge ofthe field,some
crags andpines andtheglittering leaves olbirch trees hidthespace
thatstretched toadistant wall ofencircling mountains. Herplane
wasnotshattered—itwasthere, afew{eetaway, fiatonitsbelly in
thegrass. There wasnoother plane insight, nostructures, nosign
ofhuman habitation.
“What isthisvalley?” sheasked.
Hesmiled. “The Taggart Terminal.”
“What doyoumean?”
“You’ll findout.”
Adimimpulse, liketherecoil ofanantagonist, made herwant to

shecould notthink of itnow Ittook aneffort toremember that
shehadhadagoalandamotive afewhours ago.Sheforced herself
tolecapture it.
“Didvouknow that Iwasfollowing you?” sheasked,
“No.”
“Where isyour plane0'*
“Atthelanding field.”
“Where isthelanding field?"
“On theother sideofthevalley.”
“There wasnolanding fieldmthisvalley, when llooked down.
There asnomeadow, either.How did itgethere0”
Heglanced atthesky.“Look carefully. Doyouseeanything up
there?”
Shedropped herhead back, looking straight intothesky,seeing
nothing butthepeaceful blue olmorning. After awhile shedistin-
guished afew faint strips ofshimmering air.
“Heat waves.” shesaid.
“Refractor rays,” heanswered. "The valley bottom thatyousaw is
amountain topeight thousand feethigh, fivemilesaway from here.”
“A ...what?”
“Amountain topthatnoflyerwould everchoose foralanding.
What yousawwas itsreflection projected over thisvalley.”
645
“How?"
“Bythesamemethod asamirage onadesert: animage refracted
from alayer ofheated air."
“How?"
“Byaseteonofrayscalculated against everything—except acour-
agesuch asyours."
“What doyoumean?”
“Inever thought thatanyplane would attempt todrop within
seven hundred feetoftheground. You hittherayscreen. Some of
therays arethekind that killmagnetic motors. Well, that’s the
second timeyoubeatme: I'venever been followed, either."
“Why doyoukeep thatscreen?"
“Because thisplace isprivate property intended toremain as
such."
“What isthisplace?"
“I’llshow ittoyou,now thatyou’re here. Miss Taggart. I’llanswer
questions after you’ve seen it."
Sheremained silent. Shenoticed thatshehadasked questions
about every subject, butnotabout him. Itwasasifhewere asingle
whole, grasped byher firstglance athim, likesome irreducible abso-
lute, likeanaxiom nottobeexplained any lurther, asifsheknew
everything about himbydirect perception, andwhat awaited her
nowwasonly theprocess otidentifying herknowledge.
Hewascarrying herdown anarrow trail thatwentwinding tothe
bottom ofthevalley.Ontheslopes around them, the tall,dark pyra-
mids ofllrsstood immovably straight, inmasculine simplicity, like
sculpture reduced toanessential form, andthey clashed with the
complex, feminine, overdet ailed lace-work ofthebirch leaves
trembling inthesun.Theleaves letthesunrays fallthrough tosweep
across hishair, acioss both their faces. Shecould notseewhat lay
below, beyond theturns otthe trail.
Hereyes keptcoming back tohislace.Heglanced down ather
once inawhile. At first,shelooked away, asifshehadbeen caught.
Then, asiflearning itfrom him,sheheld hisglance whenever he
chose tolookdown— knowing thatheknew what she Icllandthat
hedidnothidefrom heithemeaning ofhisglance.
Sheknew that hissilence wasthesame confession asherown.He
didnothold her intheimpersonal manner ofaman carrying a
wounded woman. Itwasanembrace, eventhough she feltnosugges-
tionof itinhisbearing; she felt itonlybymeans othercertainty
that hiswhole bodywasaware ofholding hers.
Sheheard thesound ofthewaterfall before shesawthefragile
thread that tellinbroken strips ofglitter down theledges. Thesound
came through some dimbeat inhernjind. some taintrhythm that
seemed nolouder than astruggling memory-- buttheywent pastand
thebeatremained, shelistened tothe!sound ofthewater, butan-
other sound seemed togrow clearer, Rising, not inhermind, but
fromsomewhere among theleaves. Th<$ trailturned, andinasudden
clearing shesawasmall house onaMge below, withaflashofsun
onthepane ofanopenwindow. Inthemoment when sheknew what

present—ithadbeen thenight inadusty coach oftheComet, when
shehadheard thetheme ofHalley's Fifth Concerto for"the first
time—sheknew thatshewashearing itnow, hearing itrisefrom the
keyboard ofapiano, intheclear, sharp chords ofsomeone’s power-
ful,confident touch
Shesnapped thequestion athisface, asifhoping tocatch him
unprepared: “That’s theFifthConcerto bvRichard Hallcv. isn’t it?”
“Yes.”
“When didhewrite it?”
“Why don’t youaskhimthat inperson?”
“Ishehere?”
“It'shewho’s playing it.That's hishouse.”
“Oh . . .!”
“You’ll meet him, later. He'll heglad tospeak toyou.Heknows
that hisworks aretheonly records you liketoplay, intheevening,
when youarealone”
“How does heknow that?”
“Itoldhim”
Thelookonherfacewas like aquestion thatwould havebegun
with“How inhell . ..?”—butshesawthelook ofhiseyes,andshe
laughed, herlaughter giving sound tothemeaning ofhisglance
Shecould notquestion anything, shethought, shecould notdoubt,
notnow- -not with thesound ofthatmusic rising triumphantly
thiough thesun-drenched leaves, themusic ofrelease, ofdeliverance,
played as itwasintended toheplayed, ashermind hadstruggled
tohear itinarocking coach through thebeat otwounded wheels—
itwas thisthathermind hadseenmthesounds, thatnight— this
valley andthemorning sunand—
And then shegasped, because the trailhadturned andfrom the
height ofanopen ledge shesawthetownonthefloor ofthevalley.
Itwasnotatown, only acluster ofhouses scattered atrandom
from thebottom totherising steps ofthemountains thatwenton
rising above their roofs, enclosing them within anabrupt, impassable
circle Theywerehomes, small andnew, withnaked, angular shapes
andtheglitter ofbroad windows Farinthedistance, some structures
seemed taller, andthefaint coils ofsmoke above them suggested an
industrial district Butclose before her, rising onaslender granite
column from aledge below tothelevel ofhereyes, blinding herby
itsglare, dimming therest,stood adollar signthree feet tall,made
ofsolid gold. Ithung inspace above thetown, asitscoat-of-arms,
itstrademark, itsbeacon—and itcaught thesunrays, likesome trans-
mitter ofenergy thatsentthem inshining blessing tostretch horizon-
tallythrough theairabove theroofs.
“What's that?” shegasped, pointing at(hesign.
“Oh, that's Francisco's private joke.”
“Francisco—who?” shewhispered, knowing theanswer.
“Francisco d’Anconia.”
“Ishehere, too?”
“He willbe,anydaynow.”
“What doyoumean, hisjoke?”
“Hegave that sign asananniversary present totheowner ofthis
647
place.And thenwe alladopted itasourparticular emblem. We
liked theidea.”
“Aren’t youtheowner ofthisplace?”
‘*1?No.”Heglanced down atthefootoftheledge andadded,
pointing, “There’s theowner ofthisplace, coining now.”
Acarstopped attheendofadirtroad below, andtwomenwere
hurrying upthe trail.She coilIdnotdistinguish their faces; oneof
themwasslender and tall,theother shorter, more muscular. Shelost
sight ofthem behind thetwists ofthe trail, ashewentoncarrying her
down tomeet them.
Shemetthemwhen theyemerged suddenly from behind arocky
comer afew feetaway. The sight oftheir faces hitherwith the
abruptness ofacollision.
“Well, I’llbegoddamned!” saidthemuscular man,whom shedid
notknow, staring ather.
Shewasstaring atthe tall,distinguished figure ofhiscompanion*
itwasHugh Akston.
ItwasHugh Akston whospoke first,bowing toherwith acourte-
oussmile ofwelcome. “Miss Taggart, this isthe firstlimeanyone
haseverproved mewrong. Ididn’t know- ‘•when ltoldyouyou’d
never findhim— thatthenexttime Isawyou.youwould heinhis

“Inwhose arms?”
“Why, theinventor ofthemotor”
Shegasped, closing hereyes; thiswasoneconnection sheknew
sheshould havemade.When sheopened hereyes, shewaslooking
atGalt.Hewassmiling, faintly, derisively, asifheknew fullywhat
thismeant toher.
“Itwould have served you right ityou’d broken your neck!” the
muscular mansnapped ather,with theanger ofconcern, almost of
affection. “What astunt topull—foraperson who’d havebeen ad-
mitted here soeagerly, ilshe’d chosen tocome through thefront
door!”
“Miss Taggart, may 1present Midas Mulligan?” saidGalt
“Oh,” shesaidweakly, andlaughed; shehadnocapacity foras-
tonishment anylonger. “Doyousuppose lwas killed inthatcrash~
and this issome other kind ofexistence?”
“It L\another kind olexistence,” saidGalt “Rut asiorbeing
killed, doesn’t itseemmore liketheotherwayaround?”
“Oh yes,” shewhispered, “yes . .Shesmiled atMulligan.
“Where isthefront door?”
“Here,” hesaid, pointing tohisforehead.
“I’ve lostthekey,” shesaidsimply, vtfithout resentment. “I've lost
allkeys, rightnow.”•
“YouTl findthem. Butwhat inblades were youdoing inthat
plane?”'
“Following,”
"Him?” Hepointed atGalt.
“Yes.”
“You're lucky tobealive! Areyoubadly hurt?”
“1don’t think so.”
648
“You’ll haveafewquestions toanswer, after theypatch youup.”
Heturned brusquely, leading thewaydown tothecar,thenglanced
atGalt. “Well, whatdowedonow? There's something wehadn’t
provided for:the firstscab.”
“The first ...what?” sheasked.
“Skip it,”saidMulligan, andlooked atGalt,“What dowedo?”
“Itwillbemycharge,” saidGalt. “1willberesponsible. Youtake
Quentin Daniels.”
“Oh. he’snoproblem atall.Heneeds nothing buttogetac-
quainted with theplace.Heseems toknow alltherest.”
“Yes.Hehadpractically gone thewhole waybyhimself.” Hesaw
herwatching him inbewilderment, and said, “There’s onething I
must thank you for.Miss Taggart: youdidpaymeacompliment
when youchose Quentin Daniels asmyunderstudy. Hewasaplausi-
bleone.”
“Where ishe?” sheasked “Will you tellmewhathappened?”
“Why. Midas metusatthelanding field, drovemetomyhouse
andtook Daniels with him. Iwasgoing tojointhem torbreakfast,
but Isawyour plane spinning andplunging forthatpasture. 1was
theclosest one tothescene.”
“We gothere asfastaswecould.” saidMulligan. “Ithought he
deserved togethimself killed -whoever was inthat plane. Inever
dreamed that itwasoneoftheonlytwopersons inthewhole world
whom I'dexempt.”
“Who istheother one,;”sheasked
“Hank Rearden.”
Shewinced; itwas likeasudden blowfrom another great distance.
Shewondered why itseemed toherthatGaltwaswatching her
lace intently andthatshesawaninstant’s change inhis,toobrief
todetine.
Hieyhadcome tothecar. ItwasaHammond convertible, itstop
down, oneotthecostliest models, some years old,butkept inthe
shining trimofefficient handling. Galtplaced hercautiously intheback
sealandheld her inthecircle ofhisarm.She feltastabbing pain
once inawhile, butshehadnoattention tospare for it.Shewatched
thedistant houses ofthetown, asMulligan pressed thestarter and
theearmoved forward astheywent past thesignofthedollar and
agolden ray hithereyes, sweeping over herforehead.
“Who istheowner ofthisplace?” sheasked.
“1am,” saidMulligan.
“What isher'Shepointed toGalt.
Mulligan chuckled. “He justworks here.”
“And you. Dr,Akston?” sheasked.
Heglanced atGalt. “I'moneofhistwo fathers. Miss Taggart,
lheonewho didn't betray him.”
‘Oh!” she said, asanother connection tellinto place. “Your
third pupil?”
“That's right.”
“The second assistant bookkeeper!” shemoaned suddenly, atone
morememory.
“What’s that?”
649
‘"That’s what Dr.Stadler called him.That’s what Dr.Stadler told
mehethought thisthird pupilhadbecome.”
“Heoverestimated,” saidGalt. “I’mmuch lower than thatbythe
scale ofhisstandards andofhisworld.”
Thecarhadswerved intoalane rising toward alonely house that
stood onaridge above thevalley. .Shesawamanwalking down a
path,ahead ofthem, hastening inthedirection ofthetownHewore
bluedenim overalls andcarried alunchbox. There wassomething
faintly familiar intheswift abruptness ofhisgait.Asthecarwent
pasthim.shecaught aglimpse ofhisface—andshejerked backward,
hervoice rising toascream from thepain olthemovement and
from theshock ofthesight: “Oh, stop! Stop! Don’t lethimgo!” It
was EllisWyatt.
Thethreemen laughed, butMulligan stopped thecar“Oh .
shesaidweakly, inapology, realizing shehadforgotten that thiswas
theplace from which Wyatt would notvanish.
Wyatt wasrunning toward them: hehadrecognized her,too.When
heseized theedge ofthecar,tobrake hisspeed, shesawtheface
andtheyoung, triumphant smile thatshehadseen butonce before:
ontheplatform ofWyatt Junction.
“Dagny! You, too, atlast?One ofus?”
“No.” said Galt. “Miss Taggart isacastaway.”
"Whal?"
“Miss Taggart's plane crashed Didn't yousecit?”
“Crashed— here?'"
“Yes.”
“Iheard aplane, but I . .Hislook ofbewilderment changed
toasmile, regretful, amused andfriendly “1see.Oh. hell,Dagny,
it’spreposterous!”
Shewasstaring athim helplessly, unable toreconnect thepast to
thepresent. Andhelplessly— asonewould saytoadead friend,m
adream, thewords oneregrets having missed thechance tosav in
life—shesaid,with thememory ofatelephone ringing, unansweied,
almost twoyears ago, thewords shehadhoped tosay ifsheever
caught sight ofhimagain, “I... Itried toteach you.”
Hesmiled gently. “We’ve been trying toreach youever since,
Dagny. .. .I’llseeyoutonight. Don’t worry, Iwon’t vanish—and I
don't think you will, either”
Hewaved totheothers andwent off,swinging hislunchbox. She
glanced up,asMulligan started thecar,andsawGalt's eyeswatching
herattentively. Herfacehardened, asifinopen admission ofpain
and indefiance olthesatisfaction itmight givehim. “All right,” she
said. “Iseewhat sortofshowyouwant toputmethrough theshock
ofwitnessing.”
;
Butthere wasneither cruelty nor$ity inhisface, only thelevel
look ofjustice. “Our first rulehere. Mjiss Taggart,” heanswered, “is
thatonemust always seeforoneself.’?
Thecarstopped infront ofthelonejy house. Itwas built ofrough
granite blocks, with asheet ofglass fjbrmost ofitsfront wall, “Til
send thedoctor over,” saidMulligan, driving off,while Galt carried
herupthepath.
650
“Your house?” sheasked,
“Mine,” heanswered, kicking thedoor open.
Hecarried heracross thethreshold intotheglistening space ofhis
living room, where shafts ofsunlight hitwalls ofpolished pine.She
sawafewpieces offurniture made byhand, aceiling ofbare rafters,
anarchway openupon asmall kitchen withrough shelves, abare
wooden tabicandtheastonishing sight ofchromium glittering onan
electric stove; theplace hadtheprimitive simplicity ofafrontiers*
man’s cabin, reduced toessential necessities, butreduced with a
super-modern skill.
Hecarried heracross thesunrays into asmall guestroom and
placed herdown onabed.Shenoticed awindow openupon along
slant ofrocky steps andpines going offinto theskyShenoticed
small streaks thatlooked like inscriptions cutinto thewood ofthe
walls, afewscattered lines thatseemed made bydifferent handwrit-
ings; shecould notdistinguish thewords Shenoticed another door,
lefthalf-open; itledtohisbedroom.
“Am 1aguest here oraprisoner?” sheasked.
“The choice willbeyours. Miss Taggart.”
“1canmake nochoice when Inidealing with astranger.”
“But you’re not.Didn't youname arailroad lineafterme?”
“Ohf
. . .Yes . . Itwasthesmall joltofanother connection
falling into place. “Yes, 1—”Shewaslooking atthe tallfigure with
thesun-streaked hair, with thesuppressed smile inthemercilessly
perceptive eyes--shewasseeing thestruggle tobuild herLineand
thesummer dayofthe first train’s run— shewasthinking that ifa
human figure could befashioned asanemblem ofthat Line, this
wasthefigure “Yes ... 1did ..Then, remembering therestshe
added, “But lnamed itafter anenemy.”
Hesmiled. “That's thecontradiction youhad toresolve sooner or
later Miss Taggart.”
“Itwasyou . . .wasn't it? . .whodestroyed myLine. . .
“Why, no. Itwasthecontradiction.”
Sheclosed hereyes, inamoment, sheasked, “All those stories 1
heard about you—which ofthem aretrue?”
“All ofthem.”
“Was ityouwhospread them?”
“No.What for? 1never hadanywish tobetalked about.”
“But youdoknow thatyou've become alegend?”
“Yes.”
“The young inventor oftheTwentieth Century Motor Company
istheone realversion ofthelegend, isn’t it?”
“The one that’s concretely real- -yes.”
Shecould notsay itindifferently; there was stillabreathless tone
andthedrop ofhervoice, toward awhisper, when sheasked, “The
motor ...themotor Ifound ... itwasyouwhomade it?”
“Yes.”
Shecould notprevent thejoltofeagerness thatthrew herhead
up.“The secret oftransforming energy—”shebegan, andstopped.
“Icould tell ittoyou infifteen minutes,” hesaid, inanswer to
thedesperate pleashehadnotuttered, “but there's nopower on
651
earth thatcanforcemetotell it.Ifyouunderstand this, you’ll under-
stand everything that’s baffling you.”
“That night .. .twelve years ago...aspring nightwhen you
walked outofameeting ofsixthousand murderers—that story is
true, isn't it?”
“Yes.”
“You toldthem thatyouwould stop themotor oftheworld.”
“Ihave.”
“What haveyoudone?”
*Tve done nothing,Miss Taggart. And that's thewhole otmy
secret.”
Shelooked athim silently foralongmoment. Hestood waiting,
asifhecould read herthoughts. “The destroyer—” shesaidwith a
tone ofwonder andhelplessness.
“—themost evilcreature that’s ever existed,” hesaid inthetone
ofaquotation, andsherecognized herownwords, “themanwho’s
draining thebrains oftheworld.”
“How thoroughly haveyoubeen watching me,” sheasked, "and
forhowlong?”
Itwasonlyaninstant’s pause, hiseyes didnotmove, but itseemed
toherthat hisglance was stressed, asifinspecial awareness of
seeing her,andshecaught thesound ofsome patlicular intensity in
hisvoice asheanswered quietly, “For years.”
Sheclosed hereyes, relaxing andgiving up.She feltanodd, light
hearted indifference, asitshesuddenly wanted nothing butthecom-
fortofsurrendering tohelplessness.
The doctor who arrived was agray-haired man with amild,
thoughtful faceandafirmly, uuobtiusively confident manner.
“Miss Taggart, may Ipresent Dr.Hendricks?” said Gall.
“Not Dr.Thomas Hendricks?” shegasped, with theinvoluntary
rudeness ofachild; thename belonged toagreat suigeon, whohad
retired andvanished sixyears ago.
“Yes, ofcourse.* saidGalt
Dr.Hendricks smiled ather, inanswer. “Midas toldmethatMiss
Taggart has tobetreated forshock.” hesaid, “not fortheone
sustained, butfortheones tocome”
‘I'llleave you todoit,”said Galt,’while lgotothemarket to
getsupplies forbreakfast.”
Shewatched therapid efficiency ofDr.Hendricks7work, ashe
examined herinjuries. Hehadbrought anobject shehadnever seen
before: aportable X-ray machine Shelearned thatshehadtorn the
cartilage oftwo ribs, thatshehadsprained anankle, ripped patches
ofskin oiloneknee andoneelbow, apdacquired atewbruises
spread inpurple blotches over herbody. |*ythetimeDr.Hendricks'
swift, competent hands hadwound thebandages andthetight lacings
oftape, shefeltasifherbody wereanengine checked byanexpert
mechanic, andnofurther carewasnecessary.
“Iwould advise youtoremain inbed*MissTaggart.”
“Oh no! IfI’mcareful andmove slowly. I'llbeallright.”
“You ought torest.”
“Doyouthink Ican?”
652
Hesmiled, “Iguess not.”
Shewasdressed bythetimeGaitcame back. Dr.Hendricks gave
himanaccount ofhercondition, adding, “Tilbeback tocheck up,
tomorrow.”
“Thanks,” said Galt.“Send the billtome.”
“Certainly not!” shesaid indignantly. “Iwillpay itmyself.”
Thetwomenglanced ateach other, inamusement, asattheboast
ofabeggar.
“We’ll discuss that later,” said Galt.
Dr.Hendricks left,andshetned tostand up,limping, catching at
thefurniture lorsupport. Gait lifted herinhisarms, carried herto
thekitchen alcove andplaced heronachairbythetable setfortwo.
Shenoticed thatshewashungry, atthesight ofthecoffee pot
boiling onthestove, thetwoglasses oforange juice, theheavy white
pottery dishes sparkling inthesunonthepolished table top.
“When didyousleep oreatlast?” heasked.
“Idon’tknow ... Ihaddinner onthetrain, with—”Sheshook
herhead inhelplessly bitter amusement: with thetramp, shethought,
with adesperate voice pleading forescape from anavenger who
would notpursue orbefound— theavenger who satfacing heracross
thetable, drinking aglass oforange juice. “Idon’tknow ... itseems
centuries andcontinents away.”
“How didyouhappen tobefollowing me?”
“Ilanded attheAlton airport justasyouwere taking off.The
man Iheie toldmethatQuentin Daniels hadgone withyou.”
“Iremember your plane circling toland. But thatwastheone
andonly timewhen 1didn’t think ofyou. Ithought youwerecoming
bytrain.”
Sheasked, looking straight athim,“How doyouwantmeto
understand that?”
“What?”
“'Iheoneandonly timewhen youdidn't think ofme.”
Heheldherglance; shesawthefaintmovement shehadnoted as
typical othim: themovement ofhisproudly intractable mouth curv-
ingintothehintofasmile. “Inanywayyouwish,” heanswered.
She leiamoment pass tounderscore herchoice bytheseverity
oiherlace, thenasked coldly, inthetoneofanenemy's accusation,
“Youknew that Iwascoming forQuentin Daniels?”
“Yes.”
“You gothim firstand fast, inorder nottoletmereach him? In
order tobeatme—knowing fullywhat sort ofbeating thatwould
mean forme?”
“Sure.”
Itwasshewholooked away andremained silent.Herose tocook
therestoftheir breaklast. Shewatched himashestood atthestove,
toasting bread, frying eggsandbacon. There wasaneasy, relaxed
skillabout thewayheworked, but itwasaskill thatbelonged to
another profession; hishands moved with therapid precision ofan
engineer pulling thelevers ofacontrol board. Sheremembered sud-
denlywhere shehadseen asexpert andpreposterous aperformance.
653
“Isthatwhatyoulearned from Dr.Akston?” sheasked, pointing
atthestove.
‘That, among other things.'’
“Did heteach you tospend your time—your time!” shecould
notkeep theshudder ofindignation outofhervoice—“on thissort
ofwork?”
T've spent timeonwork otmuch lesser importance.”
When heputherplate before her.sheasked, “Where didyouget
thatfood?Dotheyhave agrocery store here?”
“The bestone intheworld It’srunbyLawrence Hammond.”
“What?”
“Lawrence Hammond, ofHammond Oars, thebacon isfrom the
farm otDwight Sanders—ofSanders Aircraft. Theeggsandthebut-
terfrom Judge Nanagansctt- ottheSuperior Court oftheState
ofIllinois”
Shelooked atherplate, bitterly, almost as itshewere afraid to
touch it.“It’s themost expensive breakfast I’llever eat,considering
thevalue ofthecook’s timeandofallthose others.”
“Yes--from oneaspect. Butfrom another, it'sthecheapest break-
fastyou'll ever eat—because nopartofithasgone tofeed thelooters
who’ll make youpayfor itthrough year after yearandleave youto
starve intheend.”
After along silence, sheasked simply, almost wistfully, "What is
itthatyou’re alldoing here?”
“Living.”
Shehadnever heard thatword sound soreal.
“What isyour job?’ sheasked. “Midas Mulligan said thatyou
work here.”
“I'm thehandy man, Iguess.”
“The what?”
“I’moncallwhenever anything goeswrong withanyoltheinstal-
lations—with thepower system, forinstance.”
Shelooked athim—andsuddenly shetoreforward, staring atthe
electric stove, but fellbackonherchair, stopped bypain.
Hechuckled. “Yes, that's true-but take iteasyorDr.Hendricks
willorder youback tobed.”
“The power system . ..”she said, choking, “thepower system
here ...it’srunbymeans ofyourmotor?”
“Yes.”
“It’s built? It’sworking? It’sfunctioning?”
“Ithascooked your breakfast.”
“Iwant tosee it!”
“Don’t bother crippling yourself toJook atthat stove. It’sjusta
plain electric stove likeany other, (^nly about ahundred times
cheaper torun.And that’s allyou'll have achance tosee.Miss
Taggart.”
“You promised toshowmethLvalley.”
“I’llshow ittoyou.Butnotthepoier generator,”
“Will youtakemetosectheplace now, assoon aswefinish*?”
“Ifyouwish—and ifyou’re able tomove.”
“Iam.”
654
Hegotup,went tothetelephone anddialed anumber, “Hello,

Hehung up.Shewasstaring athimmciedulousiy.
“Did 1understand you tosaythatMr.Mulligan— who's worth
about twohundred million dollars. Ibelieve—isgoing tocharge you
twenty-five cents fortheuseofhiscar?”
“That’s right/’
“Good heavens, couldn’t hegive ittoyou asacourtesy?”
Hesatlooking atherforamoment, studying herface, asifdeliber-
ately letting herseetheamusement inhis.“Miss Taggart/' hesaid,
“wehavenolaws inthisvalley, norules, noformal organization of

certain customs, which we allobserve, because they pertain tothe

“I’m sorry/’ shesaid.“You're right.”
Herefilled hercupofcoffee andextended apackage ofcigarettes.
Shesmiled, asshetook acigarette: itbore thesignofthedollar.
"Ifyou're nottootiredbyevening,” hesaid,“Mulligan hasinvited
uslordinner. He'll havesome guests therewhom, 1think, you’ll
want tomeet.”
“Oh, olcourse! 1won’t betoo tired. 1don’t think I’lleverfed
tired again.”
Theywere finishing breakfast when shesawMulligan's carstop-
ping infront ofthehouse. Thedriver leaped out,raced upthepath
andrushed into theroom, notpausing toringorknock. Ittookher
amoment torealize thattheeager, breathless, disheveled youngman
wasQuentin Daniels.
“Miss Taggart,” hegasped, “I'm sorry’” Thedesperate guilt inhis
voice clashed with thejoyous excitement inhisface. “I’ve never
broken myword befote! There’s noexcuse for it,1can't askyouto
lorgive me,and Iknow thatyouwon’t believe it,butthetruth is
that I— 1forgot!”
Sheglanced atGalt. “Ibelieve you.”
“1forgot that lpromised towait, Iforgot everything—untilafew
minutes ago,when Mr.Mulligan toldmethatyou’d crashed here in
aplane, andthen 1knew itwasmyfault, and ifanything hadhap-
pened toyou—ohGod, areyou allright?”
“Yes. Don’t worry. Sitdown.”
“Idon'tknowhowonecanforget one’s word ofhonor. Idon’t

“ido.”
"Miss Taggart, 1hadbeenworking on itformonths, onthatone

“Daniels!” Shelaughed, remembering thequiet self-control, the
strict precision, thestern logic oftheyoung scientist shehadknown.
“What’s thematter withyou?Where areyou?Doyouknow what

“I’m here. MissTaggart— andthere’s nolimit towhat’s possible

“You’re going togoback toMulligan’s house,” said Galt, “and

“Yes, sir,” saidDaniels meekly.
Thesunhadtrickled down thepeaks fenddrawn acircle ofshining
granite andglittering snow toenclose thevalley—when theystepped
outofthehouse. She feltsuddenly asifnothing existed beyond that
circle, andshewondered atthejoyous, proud comfort tobefound
656
inasense ofthe finite, intheknowledge thatthe field ofone's
concern laywithin therealm ofone's sight. Shewanted tostretch
outherarms over theroofs ofthetown below, feeling thather
fingertips would touch thepeaks across. Butshecould notraise her
arms; leaning onacane withonehandandonGalt’s armwith the
other, moving herfeetbyaslow, conscientious effort, shewalked
down tothecarlikeachild learning towalk forthe firsttime.
She satbyGalt’s side ashedrove, skirting thetown, toMidas
Mulligan’s house. Itstood onaridge, thelargest house ofthevalley,
theonlyone builttwo stories high, anoddcombination offortress
andpleasure resort, with stout granite walls andbroad, open ter-
races.Hestopped toletDaniels off,thendrove onupawinding
road rising slowly intothemountains.
Itwasthethought ofMulligan’s wealth, theluxurious carandthe
sight ofGalt’s hands onthewheel thatmade herwonder forthe
firsttimewhether Galt, too,waswealthy. Sheglanced athisclothes:
thegray slacks andwhite shirtseemed ofaquality intended forlong

thewatch onhiswristwas aprecision instrument, butmade ofplain
stainless steel. The sole suggestion ofluxury wasthecolor ofhis

Abruptly, behind aturn oftheroad, shesawthegreen acres of
pastures stretching toadistant farmhouse. There were herds of
sheep, some horses, thefenced squares ofpigpens under thesprawl-

stopped theearandwaved tohim. butsaidnothing inanswer toher
questioning glance. He letherdiscover forherself, when theman

“Hello. Miss Taggart,” hesaid, smiling.
Shelooked silently athisrolled shirt sleeves, athisheavy boots,
attheherds ofcattle. “So that's allthat’s leftofSanders Aircraft.”
shesaid.
“Why. no. Ihere’s thatexcellent monoplane, mybestmodel, which

“Oh, youknow about that? Yes. itwasoneofyours. Uwasa

“You ought tohave itfixed.”
“1think I’veripped thebottom. Nobody can fixit.”
“Ican.”
These were thewords andthetone ofconfidence thatshehadnot

asked. “On ahogfarm?”
“Why, no.AtSanders Aircraft.”
“Where isit?”
“Where didyouthink itwas? Inthat building inNew Jersey,

‘‘Where isit,then?”
“Wherever lam.”
Hepointed across theroad. Glancing down through thetops of
thepine trees, shesawtheconcrete rectangle ofanairfield onthe

“Wehave afewplanes hereand it’smyjobtotakecare ofthem,”
hesaid. “I’m thehogfarmer and theairfield attendant. I'mdoing

“How much?”
“Two hundred dollars.”
“Two hundred dollars?” sherepeated incredulously: theprice
seemed much loolow.
“Ingold. Miss Taggart.”
“Oh . ..!Well, where can lbuythegold?”
“You can’t.” said (Jalt.
Shejerked herhead tofacehim defiantly. “No?”
“No.Notwhere youcome from.Your laws forbid it.”
“Yours don’t?”
“No.”
“Then sell ittome.Choose yourdwn rate ofexchange. Name

“What money? You’re penniless, MbsTaggart/’
"What?” Itwasaword that aTaggart heiress could notever ex-

“You're penniless inthis valley. Youown millions ofdollars in

“Isee.”
Galt smiled andturned toSanders. “Goahead and fixthatplane.

“What ateyoudoing here? What was itthatyoubetrayed metor,

Hesmiled, pointing atthestone structure anddown attherocky

“Alone?”

“What men?From where7”
“Well, oneofthem isaprofessor ofeconomics who couldn’t get

“They work foryouasplumbers andlinesmen?”
“Yqu’J besurprised howgood they are atit.”
“And towhom have theyabandoned ourcolleges?”
“To those who’re wanted there.” Hechuckled. “How longago

Where isyour Linenow? Butmy lineshave grown, inthat time,

Hesawtheswift, involuntary look ofeagerness onherface, the
lookofacompetent person’s appreciation; hesmiled, glanced ather
companion andsaid softly, “You know, Miss Taggart, when itcomes
totheJohn Galt Line—maybe it’s 1who’ve followed itandyou
who’re betraying it.”
Sheglanced atGalt.Hewaswatching herface,butshecould read
nothing inhis.
Astheydrove onalong theedge ofthelake, sheasked, “You’ve
mapped thisroute deliberately, haven’t you?You’re showing me all
themenwhom”—shestopped, feeling inexplicably reluctant tosay
it,and said, instead—“whom Ihave lost?”
‘Tinshowing you allthemenwhom Ihavetaken away from you,”
heanswered firmly.
Thiswastheroot, shethought, oftheguiltlessness ofhisface: he
hadguessed andnamed thewords shehadwanted tospare him.he
hadrejected agood will thatwasnotbased onhisvalues—and in
proud certainty ofbeing right, hehadmade aboast ofthatwhich
shehadintended asanaccusation.
Ahead ofthem, shesaw'awooden pierprojecting intothewater

watching abattery offishing rods.Sheglanced upatthesound of

Galtwaved toher.
“Hello, John!When didyou getin?”shecalled.
“This morning/’ heanswered, smiling anddriving on.
Dagny jerked herhead tolook back andsaw theglance with
which theyoungwoman stood looking after Galt.Andeven though
hopelessness, serenely accepted, was part oftheworship inthat
glance, sheexperienced afeeling shehadneverknown before: astab
ofjealousy.
“Who isthat?” sheasked.
“Our best lishwife. Sheprovides the fishforHammond’s grocery
market.”
“What else isshe?”
“You’ve noticed that there’s alwhat else’ forevery one otus

Thecarturned intoanarrow path, climbing steeply intoawilder-

EllisWyatt stood onaridge, watching theglass dialofagauge
imbedded intherock.Hesawthecarstopping below, and called,
“Hi,Dagny! Bewithyou inaminute’”
There were twoothermenworking wilh him: abig,muscular
roughneck, atapump halfway upthewall,andayoung boy,bythe

anunusual purity oflorm. She feltcertain thatsheknew this face,
hutshecould notrecall where shehadseen it.Theboycaught her
puzzled glance, grinned and, asiftohelp her,whistled softly, almost
inaudibly the firstnotes ofHalley's Fifth Concerto. Itwastheyoung
brakeman oftheComet.
She laughed. “Itwas the Fifth Concerto byRichard Halley,
wasn’t it?”
“Sure," heanswered, “Butdo\outhink I’d tellthattoascab?”
“Awhat?"
“What am1paying youtor?" asked EllisWyatt, approaching; the
hoychuckled, darting hack toseize thelever hehadabandoned for

“That’s oneofthereasons why Iquit therailroad. MtssTaggart,”

“Who is?”
“Richard Halley. Music. He’s Halley's best pupil."
Shesmiled. “1know, this isaplace where oneemploys nothing

“They’re allaristocrats, that's true," saidWyatt, “because they
know thatthere’s nosuch thing asalousy job—only lousymenwho

Theroughneck waswatching them from above, listening wilh curi-

asked, “What wereyououtside? Aprofessor ofcomparative philol-
ogy, 1suppose?”
“No,ma’am.” heanswered. “Iwas atruck driver." Headded,
“But that’s notwhat Iwanted toremain.”
EllisWyatt waslooking attheplace around them with akindof
youthful pride eager foracknowledgment: itwasthepride ofahost
ataformal reception inadrawing room, andtheeagerness ofan

Onadistant mountainside, inthedense green ofaforest, shesaw

“Who’s thelumberjack around here?” sheasked.

Shedosed hereyes. Shethought oftheweeds thatwere climbing

shocked hertoseesological asign as“Stockton Foundry” above

When shewalked, leaning onhercane, outofthesunlight into
thedankgloom ofthebuilding, theshock she feltwaspartsense of
anachronism, parthomesickness. Thiswastheindustrial East, which
inthe lastfewhours, hadseemed tobecenturies behind her.This

“Hi,Dagny!”
Thesmiling face thatapproached heroutofthefogwasAndrew
Stockton’s andshesawagrimy hand extended toherwith agesture
ofconfident pride, asifitheld allofhermoment’s vision onitspalm.
vSheclasped thehand. “Hello,” she said softly, notknowing
whether shewasgreeting thepastorthefuture. Then sheshook her
headandadded, “How come you’re notplanting potatoes ormaking
shoes around here? You've actually remained inyour own
profession.”
“Oh, Calvin Atwood oftheAtwood Light andPower Company
ofNewYork City ismaking theshoes. Besides, myprofession is
oneoftheoldest andmost immediately needed anywhere. Still, l

“What?"
Hegrinned andpointed totheglassdoor ofasun-flooded room,
“There's myruined competitor,” hesaid.

“He’s asculptor,” saidStockton. “When Icame here, heand his

“Who’s that?”

“Yes ..shewhispered. “Oh yes!”
Shewondered what hadmade hersay itwith such immediate

thisvalley wasimpossible—and that thiswas hisplace, peculiarly
his,thiswastheplace ofhisyouth, ofjhis start, and, together, the
place hehadbeen seeking allhis life,thelandhehadstruggled to
reach thegoal ofhistortured battle. . Itseemed toherthat the
spirals offlame-tinged fogwere drawing time intoanodd circle—
andwhile adimthought went floating through hermind likethe
streamer ofanunfollowed sentence: Toholdanunchanging youth
istoreach, attheend, thevision withwhich onestarted—sheheard
thevoice ofatramp inadiner, saying, “John Galtfound thefountain

Asheaf ofsparks wentupinthedepth ofthefog—andshesaw
thebroad back ofaforeman whose armmade thesweeping gesture
ofasignal, directing some invisible task.Hejerked hishead tosnap

"Hey, Ken!Come here! Here’s anoldfriend ofyours!”
Shelooked atKenDanagger asheapproached them. The great
industrialist, whom shehad tried sodesperately tohold tohisdesk,
wasnowdressed insmudged overalls.
‘Hello, Miss Taggart. 1toldyouwe’dsoonmeet again”
Herhead dropped, asifinassent and ingreeting, butherhand
boredown heavily upon hercane, toramoment, while shestood
reliving their lastencounter: Thetortured hour ofwaiting, then the
gently distant face atthedeskandthethinking olaglass-paneled

Itwassobrief amoment thattwo otthemen before hercould

“1didn't expect it,”shesaid softly, toDanagger. “Inever expected

Danagger waswatching heras itshewere apromising child he

"Iknow,” hesaid.“Butwhyareyousoshocked?”
"I . .oh, it’sjust that it'spreposterous!” Shepointed athis

“What's wrong with it?”
"Isthis, then, theendofyour road0”
"Hell, no!Thebeginning.”
"What areyouaiming at?”
“Mining. Not coal, though. Iron.”

Hepointed toward themountains. "Right here. Didyouever

"And ifyoudon’t findanyironore?”
Heshrugged. “There's other things todo.I’vealways been short

Sheglanced atStockton with curiosity. "Aren't youtraining aman

"That's theonly sortofmen Iliketohire.Dagny, haveyoulived

Shewaslistening tohimwithaneager, incredulous smile. “It’s so

“Yes”
“Didyouknow, then, that lwaswaiting outside?”
“Yes.”
“Didyouknow what itwas like, towaitbehind thatclosed door?”

“Oh yes,” heanswered quietly, almost lightly.
The firstshop torisebythesideofthevalley’s single street was
likethesudden signofanopen theater: aframe boxwithout tront

cubes, green circles, gold triangles, which were bins oftomatoes,

where thesun hitshelves ofrreial containers. Thename onthe

involuntarily, even though themanwasLawience Hammond.
Tireshops were small one-story structures, andastheymoved past

There were fewpassers-by, some men, fewer women, andthey

One after another, theystopped atthesight ofthecar,theywaved

recognition ’‘Have Ibeenexpected here foralongtime?” sheasked,
“You stillare,” heanswered.
Ontheedge oftheroad, shesawastructure made ofglass sheets
heldtogether byawooden framework, butforoneinstant itseemed
toherthat itwasonly aframe forthepainting ofawoman—atall,
fragile woman with paleblond hairandafaceofsuchbeauty that
itseemed veiled bydistance, as itthe artist hadbeen merely able
tosuggest it,nottomake itquite real. Inthenext instant thewoman
moved herhead—andDaguy realized thatthere were people atthe
tables inside thestructure, that itwas acafeteria, thatthewoman
stood behind tirecounter, and thatshewasKayLudlow, themovie
starwho, once seen, could nevei beforgotten: thestarwhohad

Galtreached into hispocket anddropped twosmall coins intothe
palm ofherhand.They were miniature disks olshining gold, smaller
than pennies, (hekind thathadnotbeen incirculation since thedays
ofNatTaggart: theybore thehead oftheStatue ofLiberty onone

Shewasstudying thecoins.“Phislooks like . ..likesomething

Hepointed atthevalley. “Yes, doesn’t it?”
She satlooking atthetwo thin, delicate, almost weightless drops
ofgold inthepalm ofherhand, knowing that thewhole ofthe
Taggart Transcontinental system hadrested upon them, that thishad
been thekeystone supporting allthekeystones, allthearches, all

“Pmmaking itashard aspossible.”
“Why don’t yousay it?Why don’.t you tellme allthethings you

Thegesture ofhisarmpointed atthetown, attheroad behind
them.“What have Ibeen doing?” heasked.
They drove oninsilence. After awhile, sheasked inthetone ofa
dryly .statistical inquiry, “How much ofafortune hasMidas Mulligan
amassed inthisvalley?”
Hepointed ahead.‘Judge foryourself.”
Theroadwaswinding through stretches ofunleveled soiltoward
thehomes ofthevalley. Thehomes were notlined along astreet,
theywere spread atirregular intervals over therisesandhollows of
theground, theywere small andsimple, built oflocal materials,
mostly ofgranite andpine, with aprodigal ingenuity ofthought and
atighteconomy ofphysical effort. Every house looked asifithad
been putupbythelabor ofoneman,notwohouses were alike, and
theonly quality theyhad incommon wasthestamp ofamind grasp-
ingaproblem andsolving it.Cialt pointed outahouse, once ina
while, choosing thenames sheknew—and itsounded toherlike a
listofquotations from therichest stock exchange intheworld, or
likearoll callofhonor: “KenDanagger . ..TedNielsen . .Law-
renceHammond . . .Roger Marsh . . .HllisWyatt . . .Owen
Kellogg ...Dr.Akston.”
Thehome ofDr.Akston wasthe last, asmall cottage withalarge
terrace, lifted onthecrest ofawave against therising walls ofthe
mountains, lireroadwent past itandclimbed oninto thecoils of
anascending grade. Thepavement shrank toanarrow pathbetween
twowalls ofancient pines, their tall,straight trunks pressing against
itlikeagrim colonnade, their branches meeting above, swallowing
thepath intosudden silence and twilight. There werenomarks of
wheels onthethin strip ofearth, itlooked unused andforgotten, a
fewminutes andafewturnsseemed totake thecarmilesaway from
human habitation—andthen the»e wasnothing tobreak thepressure
ofthestillness butararewedge ofsunlight cutting across thetrunks
inthedepth oftheforest once inawhile.
Thesudden sight ofahouse ontheedge ofthepath struck her
liketheshock ofanunexpected sound: built inloneliness, cutoff
from alltiestohuman existence, itlooked likethesecret retreat of
some great defiance orsorrow. Itwasthehumblest home ofthe
valley, alogcabin beaten indark streaky bythetears ofmany rains,
only itsgreat windows withstanding thestorms with thesmooth,
shining, untouched serenity ofglass. I
“Whose house is ...Oh!”—shecaught herbreath andjerked her
head away.Above thedoor, hitbyarhyofsun, itsdesign blurred
andworn, battered smooth bythewindi ofcenturies, hung thesilyer
coat-of-arms ofSebastian d’Anconia.

Galtstopped thecarinfront ofthehouse. Foramoment, theyheld
each other’s eyes: herglance was aquestion, hisacommand, her
facehadadefiant frankness, hisanunrevealing severity; sheunder-
stood hispurpose, butnothismotive. Sheobeyed. Leaning onher
cane, shestepped outofthecar,then stood erect, facing thehouse.
Shelooked atthesilver crest thathadcome from amarble palace
inSpain toashack intheAndes toalogcabin inColorado—the
crest ofthemenwhowould notsubmit. Thedoor ofthecabin was
locked, thesundidnotreach into theglazed darkness beyond the
windows, andpinebranches hung outstretched above theroof like
arms spread inprotection, incompassion, insolemn blessing. With
nosound butthesnap ofatwigortheringofadrop falling some-
where intheforest through long stretches oimoments, thesilence
seemed tohold allthepain thathadbeen hidden here, butnever
given voice. Shestood, listening with agentle, resigned, unlamenting
respect; Let’s seewho’ll dogreater honor, you—toNatTaggart, or
1—toSebastian d'Anconia. .. .Dagny! Helpmetoremain. Torefuse.
Even though he’s right! . ..
Sheturned tolook atGalt,knowing thathewastheman against

forearm leaning against thewheel atthesame angle, thefingers of
hishand hanging down inthesame sculptured position. Hiseyes
were watching hei,butthatwas allshecould read inhisface: that
hehadwatched herintently, without moving.
When shewasseated beside himonce more, hesaid,“That was
the firstman Itookaway from you."
Sheasked, herface stern, open andquietly defiant, “How much
doyouknow about that?"
“Nothing thathetoldmeinwords. Everything thatthetone of
hisvoice toldmewhenever hespoke ofyou."
Sheinclined herhead. Shehadcaught thesound ofsuffering in
thefaintest exaggeration ofevenness inhisvoice.
Hepressed thestarter, themotor’s explosion blasted thestory
contained inthesilence, andtheydrove on.
The pathwidened alittle, streaming toward apool ofsunlight
ahead. Shesawabrief glitter ofwiresamong thebranches, asthey
drove out into aclearing. Anunobtrusive little structure stood
against ahillside, onarising slant ofrocky ground. Itwasasimple
cube ofgranite, thesizeofaloolshed. ithadnowindows, noaper-
tures ofanykind, only adoor ofpolished steelandacomplex set

leaving itunnoticed, when sheasked with asudden start, “What’s

Shesawthefaintbreak ofhissmile. “The powerhouse."
"Oh, stop, please!"
Heobeyed, backing thecartothefoot ofthehillside. Itwasher

Shestood looking upatthestructure, herconsciousness surrend-

always known thatanemotion wasasura totaled byanadding ma-
chine ofthemind, andwhat shenow feltwastheinstantaneous total
ofthethoughts shedidnothave toname, thefinalsum ofalong
progression, likeavoice telling herbymeans ofafeeling: Ifshehad

onearth—if,likeaweighted diver sinking inanocean ofmediocrity,
under thepressure ofmen with gelatin eyes, rubber voices, spiral-
shaped convictions, non-committal soulsandnon-committing hands,
shehad held, asher lifelineandoxygen tube, thethought ofa
superlative achievement ofthehuman mind— if,atthesight ofthe
motor’s remnant, inasudden gasp ofsuffocation, asalastprotest
from hiscorruption-eaten lungs. Dr.Stadler hadcried forsomething,
nottolookdown at,butupto,and (fitshadbeen thecry,thelonging
andthefuelofher life—ifshehadmoved, drawn bythehunger of
heryouth forasight ofclean, hard, radiant competence —then here
itwasbefore her,reached anddone, thepower ofanincomparable
mind given shape inanetotwires sparkling peacefully under a
summer sky,drawing anincalculable power outofspace into the
secret interior ofasmall stone hovel.
Shethought ofthisstructure, halfthesi/eofaboxcar, replacing
thepower plants ofthecountry, theenormous conglomerations of
steel, lueland effort—shethought ofthecurrent flowing from this
structure, lifting ounces, pounds, tons ofstrain from theshoulders
ofthosewhowould make itoruse it,adding hours, daysandyears
ofliberated time totheir lives, be itanextramoment toliftone's

power otthismotor—with alltheenergy ofthatweight, that strain,
thattimereplaced andpaid forbytheenergy ofasingle mindwho
hadknown how tomake connections ofwire follow theconnections
ofhisthought. Butsheknew thatthere wasnomeaning inmotors
orfactories ortrains, that their onlymeaning was inman’s enjoyment
ofhis life,which they served—and thatherswelling admiration at
thesight ofanachievement was forthemanfromwhom itcame,
forthepower andtheradiant vision within himwhich hadseen the
earth asaplace ofenjoyment and hijdknown that thework ot
achieving one’s happiness wasthepurpose, thesanction andthe
meaning oflife. l
Thedoor ofthestructure wasastraight, smooth vsheet olstainless

ite,astheonly feature ofthebuilding’* rectangular austerity, there
stood aninscription:

Sheturned toGalt.Hestood beside her;hehadfollowed her,she
hadknown that thissalute was his.Shewaslooking attheinventor
ofthemotor, butwhat shesawwas theeasy, casual figure ofa
workman inhisnatural setting andfunction—shenoted theuncom-

showed anexpert control oftheuseofhisbody—atallbody in
simple garments: athin shirt, light slacks, abeltabout aslender
waistline—andloose hairmade toglitter likemetal bythecurrent of
asluggish wind. Shelooked athimasshehadlooked athisstructure.
Then sheknew thatthe firsttwosentences theyhadsaid toeach
other stillhung between them, filling thesilence—thateverything
said since, hadbeen saidover thesound ofthose words, thathehad
known it,hadheld it.hadnot letherforget it.Shewassuddenly
aware thattheywere alone; itwasanawareness that stressed the
fact,permitting nofurther implication, yetholding the fullmeaning

andsheknew what ritewastheproper form ofworship tobeoffered

She lethimlook atitforamoment, almost asanactofconde-

sheasked, with anote ofimperious pride inhervoice, pointing at
theinscription. “What's that?"

She said, looking atthewords, “This hasalways beenmyown
ruleofliving.”
“Iknow it,”
“But Idon't think thatyours isthewav topractice it."
“Then you'll have tolearn which oneofusiswrrong.”
Shewalked uptothesteeldoor ofthestructure, with asudden
confidence faintly stressed inthemovements ofherbody, amere

more demanding, yetwarmer than asmile.
Heopened thedoor ofhishouse, moving hisarmashade more
slowly thannormal, giving animperceptibly solemn emphasis tohis
gesture. Walking intotheliving room, shefaced sevenmenwholose
totheir leet atherentrance.
“Gentlemen —Taggart Transcontinental," saidMidas Mulligan.
Hesaid itsmiling, butonly half-jesting; sonic quality inhisvoice
made thename oftherailroad sound asifitwould havesounded in
thedays ofNatTaggart, asasonorous titleofhonor.
Sheinclined herhead, slowly, inacknowledgment tothemenbe-
foreher,knowing thatthese were themenwhose standards olvalue
andhonor were thesame asheiown, themenwhorecognized the
glory ofthat title assherecognized it,knowing with asudden stab
otwistfulness howmuch shehadlonged forthatrecognition through
allheryears
Her eyesmoved slowly, ingreeting, from face tolace. Ellis
Wyatt—KenDanaggcr—Hugh Akston -Dr.Hendricks -Quentin
Daniels—Mulligan’s voice pronounced thenames ofthetwoothers:
“Richard Halley—Judge Narragansett."
The faint smile onRichard Halley’s faceseemed totellherthat
theyhadknown each other foiyears—as.inherlonely evenings
bythesideofherphonograph, they had. 'The austerity olJudge
Narragansett’s white-haired ligure reminded heithatshehadonce

thecountry when thegold coins hadvanished from thecountry’s

“You havebelonged here foralong time. Miss Taggart." said
Midas Mulligan. “This wasnotthewayweexpected youtocome,
but—welcome home."
No!Shewanted toanswer, butheard herself answering soitly,
“Thank you."
“Dagny, howmany years isitgoing totakeyou tolearn tobe

“We never make assertions. Miss Taggartx"saidHugh Akston
“That isthemoral crime peculiar toourenemies. Wedonot tell—

“IfeelasifIknow it,"sheanswered jsimply, “and more: 1feelas

afraid tohear it,justafraid that it’scothing soclose."
Akston smiled. “What does thislook liketoyou.MissTaggart?"
Hepointed around theroom.
“This?” Shelaughed, suddenly, looking atthefaces ofthemen
674
against thegolden sunburst ofrays filling thegreat windows. 'This

“Well, that’s oneclue tothenature ofoursecret,” saidAkston.
“Ask yourself whether thedream ofheaven andgreatness should

“1know,” shewhispered.
“And ifyoumetthose greatmen inheaven,’' asked KenDanag-

“That's not ail.” saidDunagger “There's something you'd want

herhead andnodded silently, headdown, nottoletthem seethe

Dagny!—welldone- toowell-andnow it'stime toryoutorestfrom
thatburden which none ofusshould everhavehad tocarry.”
“Shut up,” saidMidas Mulligan, looking atherbowed head with
anxious concern
Butshe raised herhead, smiling “Thank you, 'she said to
Danagger.
“Ifyou talkabout resting, then letherrest,” saidMulligan. “She’s
hadloomuch foroneday.”
“No.” Shesmiled. “Goahead, say it--whatever itis.”
“Later,” saidMulligan.
ItwasMulligan andAkston whoserved dinner, withQuentin Dan-
ielstohelpthem. They served itcmsmall silver trays, tobeplaced
onthearms ofthechairs- -and they allsatabout theroom, with the
fireoftheskvfading inthewindows andsparkles ofelectric light
glittering inthewine glasses There wasanairotluxury about the
room, but itwastheluxury ofexpert simplicity: shenoted thecostly
furniture, carefully chosen torcomfort, bought somewhere atatime
when luxury had stillbeen anart.There werenosuperfluous objects,
butshenoticed asmall canvas byagreat master oftheRenaissance
worth afortune, shenoticed anOriental rugofatexture andcolor
thatbelonged under glass inamuseum. ThiswasMulligan’s concept
ofwealth, shethought— thewealth ofselection, notofaccumulation.
Quentin Daniels satonthe floor, with histrayonhislap:he
seemed completely athome, andheglanced upatheronce ina

Shenoticed another person whowas intensely aware ofnail’s
presence: Hugh Akston glanced upathimonce inawhile, involun-
tarily, almost surreptitiously, asifstruggling nottoconfess theloneli-

brushed itback, hishand lingering foranimperceptible instant on
hispupil’s forehead: itwastheonlybreak ofemotion hepermitted

Shewasbarely aware ofherquestions, asshespoke tooneman

When thinkers accept thosewhodeny theexistence ofthinking, as

“—whotook fifteen minutes,” saidMulligan.
Sheturned tohim “itwasyouwho established thisvalley?”
“Yes,” said Mulligan. “Itwas justmyown private retreat, atfirst.

“Wehadnorules ofanykind.” said Galt, “except one.When a

“You see.MissTaggart,” saidHugh Akston, “man isasocial being,
butnot inthewaythelooters preach.”
“It's thedestruction ofColorado that started thegrowth ofthis
valley,” saidMidas Mulligan. “Ellis Wyatt andtheothers came tolive

“The world iscrashing faster thanweexpected,*’ saidHugh Akston.
“Men arestopping andgiving up.Your frozen trains, thegangs of

‘You don’t have toanswer usnow.”
Sheraised herhead; hewaswatching herasifhehadlollowed the

“We never demand agreement,” hesaid.‘Wenever tellanyone

“Harder,” shewhispered.
“Iknow.”
Hesaid it,hisvoice aslowashers, with thesame sound ofbeing
forced pastone’s breath, andshemissed aninstant oftime, asthe
stillness after ablow, because she feltthatthis— notthemoments
when hehadearned her inhisarmsdown themountainside, but
thismeeting oftheir voices—hadbeen theclosest physical contact
between them.
Afullmoon stood intheskyabove thevalley, when theydrove
back tohishouse; itstood likeafiat,round lantern without rays,with
ahaze oflighthanging inspace, notreaching theground, andthe
687
illumination seemed tocome from theabnormal white brightness of
the soil. Intheunnatural stillness ofsight without color, theearth
seemed veiled byafilmofdistance, itsshapes didnotmerge intoa
landscape, butwent slowly flowing past, liketheprint ofaphotograph
onacloud. Shenoticed suddenly thatshewassmiling. Shewaslooking
down atthehouses ofthevalley. Their lighted windows weredimmed
byabluish cast, theoutlines oftheir wallswere dissolving, longhands
ofmistwere coiling among them intorpid, unhurried waves. Itlooked
Tike acitysinking under water.
“What dothey call thisplace?” sheasked.
“Icall itMulligan’s Valley,” hesaid.“The others call itGalt’s
Gulch.”
“I’d callit-—” butshedidnot finish.
Heglanced ather.Sheknew' what hesaw inherface.Heturned

Theroadgrew darker, as itwent higher, andpine branches met
over their heads. Above aslant olrockmoving tomeet them, she
sawthemoonlight onthewindows ofhishouse. Herhead tellback
against theseatandshelay still, losing awareness ofthecar, feeling
only themotion thatcarried herforward, watching theglittering drops
ofwater inthepine branches, which were thestars.

‘Have youforgotten thatyouwanted toshootmeonsight?” he

Itwastheunprotected stillness ofhisfigure thatmade itreal.The
shudder thatthrew herupright was like acryofterror and denial;
butsheheld hisglance andanswered evenly, “That’s true. Idid.”
“Then stand byit,”
Hervoicewaslow, itsintensity wasboth asurrender andascornful

Heshook hishead. “No, 1wantyou toremember that thathad

Chapter I!THEUTOPIA OFGREED
“Good morning.”
Shelooked athimacross theliving room from* thethreshold of
herdoor. Inthewindows behind him, themountains hadthattinge
ofsilver-pink which seems brighter than daylight, with thepromise
ofalight tocome. Thesunhadrisensomewhere over theearth, but
689
ithadnotreached thetopofthebarrier, andtheskywasglowing
initsstead, announcing itsmotion. Shehadheard the'joyous greeting
tothesunrise, which wasnotthesong ofbirds, buttheringing of
thetelephone amoment ago; shesawthestart ofday, notinthe
shining green ofthebranches outside, butintheglitter ofchromium
onthestove, thesparkle ofaglass ashtray onatable, andthecrisp
whiteness ofhisshirt sleeves. Irresistibly, sheheard thesound ofa
smile inherown voice, matching his,assheanswered;
“Good morning.”
Hewasgathering notes ofpenciled calculations from hisdeskand
stuffing them into hispocket. “1have togodown tothepower-
house,” hesaid.“They've justphoned methatthey’re having trouble
with therayscreen. Your plane seems tohaveknocked itoffkey.
I'llbeback inhalfanhourandthenHIcook ourbreakfast.”
Itwasthecasual simplicity ofhisvoice, themanner oftaking her
presence and their domestic routine forgranted, asifitwere of
nosignificance tothem, thatgave herthesense ofanunderscored
significance andthefeeling thatheknew it.
Sheanswered ascasually, “Ifyou’ll bringmethecane Ileftinthe
car. I’llhave breakfast ready foryoubythetimeyoucome back.”
Heglanced atherwith aslight astonishment; hiseyesmoved from
herbandaged ankle totheshort sleeves oftheblouse that lefther
arms bare todisplay theheavy bandage onherelbow. Butthetrans-
parent blouse, theopen collar, thehair falling down totheshoulders
thatseemed innocently naked under athin filmofcloth,made her
look like aschoolgirl, notaninvalid, andherposture made the
bandages look irrelevant.
Hesmiled, notquite ather,butasifinamusement atsome sudden
memory ofhisown. “Ifyouwish.” hesaid.
Itwasstrange tobeleftalone inhishouse. Part of itwasan
emotion shehadnever experienced before: anawed respect that
made herhesitantly conscious ofherhands, asiftotouch anyobject
around herwould betoogreat anintimacy. Theother partwas a
reckless sense ofease, asense ofbeing athome inthisplace, as it
sheowned itsowner.
Itwasstrange tofeelsopure ajoyinthesimple taskofpreparing
abreakfast ITieworkseemed anend initself, asifthemotions of
filling acoffee pot,squeezing oranges, slicing bread wereperformed
fortheirown sake, forthesortofpleasure oneexpects, butseldom
finds, inthemotions ofdancing. Itstartled hertorealize thatshe
hadnotexperienced thiskind ofpleasure inherwork since herdays
attheoperator’s deskmRockdale Station.
Shewassetting thetable, when shesawthefigure ofaman hur-
ryingupthepath tothehouse, aswift, agile figure thatleaped over
boulders with thecasual ease ofa(light.Hethrew thedoor open,
calling, “Hey, John!”— andstopped short ashesaw her.Hewore a
dark bluesweater and slacks, heha<|gold hairandafaceofsuch
shocking perfection ofbeauty thatshkstood still, staring athim, not
inadmiration, atfirst,but insimple disbelief.
Helooked atherasifhehadnotexpected tofindawoman in
thishouse. Then shesawalookofrecognition melting into adiffer-
690
entkindofastonishment, partamusement, parttriumph melting into
achuckle. “Oh, haveyoujoined us?” heasked.
“No.” sheanswered dryly, “Ihaven’t. I’mascab.”
Helaughed, likeanadult atachildwho usestechnological words
beyond itsunderstanding. “Ifyouknow what you’re saying, you
know that it’snotpossible,” hesaid. ‘Not here.”
“Icrashed thegate. Literally.”
Helooked atherbandages, weighing thequestion, hisglance al-
most insolent initsopen curiosity. “When?”
“Yesterday.”
“How?”
“Inaplane.”
“What wereyoudoing inaplane inthispartofthecountry?”
Hehadthedirect, imperious manner ofanaristocrat orarough-
neck; helooked likeoneandwasdressed liketheother. Sheconsid-
eredhim foramoment, deliberately letting himwait. “1wastrying
tolandonaprehistoricai mirage." sheanswered. “And 1have.”
“You arcascab,” hesaid,andchuckled, asifgrasping allthe
implications oftheproblem. “Where’s John?”
“Mr. Galt isatthepowerhouse. Heshould bebackanymoment.”
Hesatdown inanarmchair, asking nopermission, asifhewere
athome. .Sheturned silently toherwork.Hesatwatching hermove-
ments withanopen grin, asifthesight ofherlaying outcutlery on
akitchen tablewere thespectacle ofsome special paradox.
“What didFrancisco saywhen hesawyouhere?” heasked.
Sheturned tohimwith aslight jolt,butanswered evenly, “He is
nothere yet."
‘‘Not yet?”Heseemed startled “Are yousure?”
“So Iwas told."
Helighted acigarette. Shewondered, watching him,what profes-
sionhehadchosen, loved andabandoned inorder tojoin thisvalley.
Shecouldmake noguess: noneseemed totit:shecaught herselfm
thepreposterous feeling ofwishing thathehadnoprofession atall,
because anywoikseemed toodangerous forhisincredible kind of
beauty. Itwasanimpersonal feeling, shedidnotlook athim asat
aman, butasatananimated work ofart—and itseemed tobea
stressed indignity oftheouter world that aperfection such ashis
should besubjected totheshocks, thestrains, thescars reserved
loranymanwholoved hiswork. Butthefeeling seemed themore
preposterous, because thelines ofhisfacehadthesort ofhardness
forwhich nodanger onearth wasamatch.
“No, MissTaggart,” hesaidsuddenly, catching herglance “you’ve
never seenmebefore.”
Shewasshocked torealize thatshehadbeen studying himopenly.
“How doyouhappen toknowwho Iam?” sheasked.
“First, I’veseenyour pictures inthepapers many times. Second,
you’re theonlywoman leftmtheouter world, tothebestofoui
knowledge, who’d beallowed toenter Galt’s Gulch. Third, you're
theonlywoman who’d have thecourage—andprodigality—stillto
remain ascab.”
“What made youcertain that Iwasascab?”
691
“Ifyouweren’t, you’dknow that it’snotthisvalley, ljuttheview
oflifeheldbymen intheouter world that isaprehistorical mirage.”
They heard thesound ofthemotor andsaw thecarstopping
below, infront ofthehouse. Shenoticed theswiftness withwhieh
herosetohisfeet atthesight ofGalt inthecar; ifitwere notfor
theobvious personal eagerness, itwould havelooked likeaninstinc-
tivegesture ofmilitary respect.
Shenoticed thewayGalt stopped, when heentered andsaw his
visitor. Shenoticed thatGalt smiled, butthat hisvoice wasoddly
low,almost solemn, asifweighted withunconfessed relief, when he
saidvery quietly, “Hello.”
“Hi,John,” said thevisitor gaily.
Shenoticed that their handshake came aninstant too lateand
lasted aninstant toolong, likethehandshake ofmenwhohadnot
been certain that their previous meeting would notbetheir last.
Galt turned toher.“Have youmet?” heasked, addressing them
both.
“Not exactly,” saidthevisitor.
“Miss Taggart, may lpresent Ragnar Danneskjdld?”
Sheknew what herfacehadlooked like,when sheheard Dannes-
kjold’s voice asfrom agreat distance: “You don't have tobefright-
ened, Miss Taggart. I’mnotdangerous toanyone inGalt’s Gulch,”
Shecould onlyshake herhead, before sherecaptured hervoice
tosay, “It’s notwhat you're doing toanyone . . .it'swhat they’TC
doing toyou....”
Hislaughter swept heroutofheimoment's stupor. “Be careful.
Miss Taggart, Ifthat'showyou’re beginning tolee!,youwon tre-
main ascab forlong.”Headded, “Butyouought tostartbyadopting
theright things from thepeople inGalt's Gulch, nottheir mistakes,
they've spent twelve years worrying about me--needlessly,” He
glanced atGalt.
“When didyougetin?”asked Galt.
“Late lastnight.”
“Sitdown. You’re going tohave breakfast with us."
“But where’s Francisco? Why isn’thehere vet?”
“Idon't know,” said Gall,tmwning slightly. “Iasked atthean-
port, justnow.Nobody’s heard from him.”
Assheturned tothekitchen, Gailmoved tofollow. “No.” she
said, “it’smyjobtoday.”
“Letmehelpyou.”
“This istheplace where onedoesn't askforhelp, isn't it?”
Hesmiled. “That’s right.”
Shehadnever experienced thepleasure ofmotion, ofwalking as
ifherfeethadnoweight tocarry, asif?thesupport ofthecane in
herhand were merely asuperfluous touch ofelegance, thepleasure
offeeling hersteps trace swift, straight Irnes, ofsensing thefaultless,
.spontaneous precision ofhergestures— «ssheexperienced itwhile
placing their foodonthetable infront cjfthetwomen.Herbearing
toldthem thatsheknew theywere watching her—sheheldherhead
likeanactress onastage, like awoman inaballroom, like the

“Francisco willbeglad toknow that it’syouwhowere hisstand-
intoday,*’ saidDanneskjdld, when shejoined them atthetable.
“Hiswhat?”
“You see,today isJune first,andthethree ofus—John, Francisco
andI—havehadbreakfast together onevery June first fortwelve
years.”
“Here?”
“Notwhenwestarted. Buthere, ever since thishouse wasbuilt
eight years ago.”Heshrugged, smiling. “For amanwhohasmore
centuries oftradition behind himthan 1have, it’sodd thatFrancisco
should bethe firsttobreak ourown tradition.”
“And Mr.Galt?” sheasked.“How many centuries doeshehave
behind him?”
“John? None atall.None behind him— but allofthose ahead.”
“Never mind thecenturies,” saidGalt. “Tellmewhat soilofyear

“No.”
“Lost anyofyour time?”
“You mean, was lwounded? No. Ihaven’t hadascratch since

“Don’t tellmeabout itnow.”

“1stilldo.Butyou’ll tellmelater.”

thatcould explain this,wasaknowledge hehad ha<5nowayo

'You've metHank Rearden?” sheasked, turning toDanneskjdld
“And hesaved vour life?”
“Yes.”
“Iwarn tohearabout it.”
"1don’t,” said Galt,
“Why not?”
“You’re notone otus.MissTaggart."
“1see.” Shesmiled, with afaint touch ofdefiance. “Were yot
thinking that lmight prevent youfrom getting Hank Rearden?”
“No, thatwasnotwhat 1wasthinking”
Shenoticed thatDanneskjold wasstudying Gulfs lace, as ifhr
too,found theincident inexplicable Galt held hisglance, deliberate!’
andopenly, asilchallenging himtofindtheexplanation andpromts
ingthathewould fail.Sheknew thatDanneskjold had failed, whci
shesawafaint crease olhumor softening Galt’s eyelids

Shesatstraight, theplanes ofherface relaxed, theshape ofher

Owen Kellogg arrived ontheafternoon ofherthird daymthe
valley.
Shedidnotknow which shocked himmost: thesight ofherstand-
ingontheedge oftheairfield ashedescended from theplane—the
sight ofherclothes: herdelicate, transparent blouse, tailored bythe
most expensive shop inNew York, andthewide, cotton-print skirt
shehadbought inthevalley forsixty cents—hercane, herbandages
orthebasket ofgroceries onherarm.
Hedescended among agroup ofmen. hesaw her.hestopped,
then rantoherasifhung forward bysome emotion sostrong that,
whatever itsnature, itlooked like terror.
“Miss Taggart . hewhispered— andsaidnothing else, while
shelaughed, trying toexplain how shehadcome tobeathim to
hisdestination.
Helistened, asifitwere irrelevant, andthenheuttered thething
fromwhich hehad torecover, “Butwethought youwere dead.”
“Who thought it?”
“All ofus... Imean, everybody intheoutside world.”
Then shesuddenly stopped smiling, while hisvoice began torecap
turc hisstory and his firstsound ofjoy.
“Miss Taggart, don’t youremember? You toldmetophone Win-
ston, Colorado, and totellthemfhatyou'd bethere bynoon ofthe
next day.Thatwastobethedaybefore yesterday. May thirty-first
Butyoudidnotreach Winston —and bylateafternoon, thenews
wasonalltheradios thatyouwere lost inaplane crashsomewhoie

Shenodded slowly, grasping theevents shehadnotthought ol
considering.
“Iheard itaboard theComet,” hesaij.“Atasmall station inthe
middle ofNew Mexico. Theconductor held usthere foranhour,
while Ihelped himtocheck thestory long-distance phones. He

Sheasked involuntarily, “Did theComet reach SanFrancisco?”
“Idon’tknow Shewascrawling north through Arizona, when 1

Shestarted walking slowly upthepathtoward thecarshehad left
infront ofHammond’s Grocery Market. Kellogg followed, andwhen
hespoke again, hisvoice dropped alittle, slowing down with their
steps, asifthere weresomething they bothwished todelay.
”1gotajobforJelfAllen,” hesaid, hisvoice hadthepeculiarly
solemn toneproper forsaying: 1have carried outyour hist will.“Your
agent atLaurel grabbed himandpulhimtowork themoment wegot
there.Theagent needed every able-bodied- -no,able-minded* —man he
could find.”
theyhadreached thecar.butshedidnotget in.
“Miss Taggart, youweren’t hurt badly, were you? Didyousay
youcrashed, but itwasn’t serious?”
“No, notserious atall. I'llbeable togelalong without Mr.Mulli-
gan’s carbytomorrow—and inadayortwo Iwon’t need thisthing,
eithci.” Sheswung hercaneandtossed itcontemptuously into the
car.They stood insilence, shewaswaiting.
“The lastlong-distance call 1made from thatstationmNewMex-
ico,” hesaidslowly, "was toPennsylvania. 1spoke toHank Rcarden.
Itoldhimeverything 1knew. Helistened, andthen there wasa
pause, andthenhesaid.Thank youforcalling me.’”Kellogg’s eyes
were lowered; headded,Tnever want tohear thatkind ofpause
again aslong as 1live.”
Heraised hiseyes tohers; there wasnoreproach inhisglance,
only theknowledge ofthatwhich hehadnotsuspected when he
hcaid herrequest, buthadguessed since.
“Thank you,” shesaid,andthrew thedoor ofthecaropen.“Can
1giveyoualift? Ihave togetbackandgetdinner ready beforemy
employer comes home.”
Itwas inthe firstmoment ofreturning toGalt’s house, ofstanding
alone inthesilent, sun-filled room, thatshefaced the fullmeaning of
what she felt.Shelooked atthewindow, atthemountains barring
theskymtheeast.Shethought ofHank Rcarden ashesatathis
desk, now,twothousand miles away, hisfacetightened intoare-
taining wall against agony, as ithadbeen tightened under allthe
blows ofallhisyears—andshe feltadesperate wish totight his
battle, tofight forhim, forhispast, forthattension ofhisfaceand
thecourage thatfed it—asshewanted tofight fortheComet that
crawled byalasteffort across adesert onacrumbling track. She
shuddered* closing hereyes, feeling asifshewere guilty ofdouble
treason, feeling asifsheweresuspended inspace "between thisvalley
andtherestoftheearth, withnoright toeither.
699
The feeling vanished when shesatfacing Galt across thedinner
table.Hewaswatching her,openly andwithanuntroubled look, as
ifherpresence were normal—andasifthesight ofherwere allhe
wished toallow into hisconsciousness.
Sheleaned back alittle, asifcomplying with themeaning ofhis
glance, and said dryly, efficiently, mdeliberate denial, “Ihave
checked your shirts andfound onewithtwobuttons missing, and
another with the leftelbow worn through. Doyouwishmeto
mend them?”
“Why, yes- -ifyoucandoit.”
“Icandoit.”
Itdidnotseem toalter thenature ofhisglance; itmerely seemed
tostress itssatisfaction, as ilthiswere what hehadwished herto
say—except thatshewasnotcertain whether satisfaction wasthe
name forthething shesaw inhiseyesand fully certain thathehad
notwished hertosayanything.
Beyond thewindow, attheedge otthetable, storm clouds had
wiped outthelastremnants oflight intheeastern sky.Shewondered
whyshe feltasudden reluctance tolook out.whyshe feltasifshe
wanted tocling tothegolden patches oflightonthewood otthe
table, onthebuttered ciust ofthe rolls,onthecopper cotfec pot,
onGalt’s hair—tocling astoasmall island ontheedge ofavoid.
Then sheheard herown voice asking suddenly, involuntarily, and
sheknew that thiswasthetreason shehadwanted toescape, “Do
youpermit anycommunication with theoutside world?”
“No.”
“Not any?Noteven anote without return address?”
“No.”
“Not even amessage, ifnosecret ofyours were given away?”
“Not from here. Notduring thismonth. Not tooutsiders atany
time.”
Shenoticed thatshewasavoiding hiseyes,andsheforced herself
toliftherheadandfacehim.Hisglance hadchanged; itwaswatch-
ful,unmoving, implacably perceptive. Heasked, looking atheras
ifheknew thereason ofheiquery, “Doyouwish toaskfora
special exception?”
“No,” sheanswered, holding hisglance.
Next morning, after breakfast, when shesatinherroom, carefully
placing apatch onthesleeve otGalt’s shirt, withherdoor closed,
nottolethimseeherfumbling effort atanunfamiliar task, she
heard thesound ofacarstopping infront ofthehouse.
Sheheard Galt’s steps hurrying across theliving room, sheheard
himjerktheentrance dooropenand calloutwith thejoyous anger
ofrelief: “It'sabout time!”I
Sherose toher feet, butstopped; sHeheard hisvoice, itstone
abruptly changed andgrave, asifinartswer totheshock ofsome
sight confronting him:“What’s thematter?”
“Hello, John,” said aclear, quiet voifce thatsounded steady, but
weighted with exhaustion.
She satdown onherbed, feeling suddenly drained ofstrength:
thevoice wasFrancisco’s.
700
Sheheard Galt asking, histonesevere withconcern* “What isit?*
‘Til tellyouafterwards.”
“Why areyousolate?”
”1have toleave again inanhour.”
“ToleaveT’
“John, Ijustcame totellyou that 1won’t beable tostayhere
thisyear.”
There wasapause, thenGaltasked gravely, hisvoice low, “Is it
asbadasthat—whatever itis?”
“Yes. 1... Imight beback before themonth isover. Idon’t
know.” Headded, with thesound ofadesperate effort, “Idon’t
know whether tohope tobedone with itquickly or...ornot.”
“Francisco, could youstand ashock rightnow?”
“I?Nothing could shockmenow.”
“There’s aperson, here, inmyguest room,whom youhave to
see. Itwillbeashock toyou, so Ithink I’dbetter warn you in
advance that thisperson isstillascab.”
“What'lAscab? Inyourhouse?”
“Letme tellyouhow—”
“That’s something Iwant toseeformyself!”
Sheheard Francisco’s contemptuous chuckle andtherush ofhis
steps, shesawherdoor flung open, andshenoticed dimly that it
wasGaltwhoclosed it,leaving them alone.
Shedidnotknowhow long Francisco stood looking ather.be*
cause the firstmoment thatshegrasped fullywaswhen shesawhim
onhisknees, holding onto her, hisfacepressed toher legs, the
moment when she feltasiftheshudder thatranthrough hisbody
and lefthim still,hadrunintohersandmade herable tomove.
Shesaw, inastonishment, thatherhandwasmoving gently over
hishair, while shewasthinking thatshehadnoright todo itand
feeling asifacurrent ofserenity were flowing from herhand, envel-
oping them both, smoothing thepast.Hedidnotmove, hemadeno

When heraised hishead, helooked asshehad feltwhen shehad
opened hereyesmthevalley: helooked as ifnopainhadever
existed intheworld. Hewaslaughing.
“Dagny, Dagny, Dagny”— hisvoice sounded, notasifaconfession
resisted foryears were breaking out,butasifhewere repeating the
long since known, laughing atthepretense that ithadeverbeen
unsaid- -“ofcourse Ilove you.Were youafraid when hemademe

outtopoint atthevalley. “There itis-— it’syour earth, yourkingdom,

Shegasped alittle, realizing whyhehadnotcome tothevalley
ontime.
Helaughed. "Don’t look like that.Don’t look atmeasif1were

"Francisco, I’vehurtyou insomany different ways—"

But itisn’t— shethought—itisn’t he,and 1can’t tellyouthetruth,
because it’samanwhomight never hear itfrommeandwhom I

“Francisco, 1didloveyou—"she said,andcaught herbreath,
shocked, realizing thatshehadnotintended tosay itand,simultane-
ously, that thiswasnotthetense shehadwanted touse.
“Butyoudo,"hesaidcalmly, smiling. “You stillloveme—even

“Francisco," shewhispered, “doyouknow that?"
“Ofcourse. Don’t youunderstand itnow? Dagny. every form of

Hereyes lowered, herface stern, holding herheadbowed asin
anactofreverence, shesaidslowly, asiffuKilling asolemn promise,
“Will youforgive me?"
Helooked astonished, thenchuckled gaily, remembering, andan-
swered, “Not yet.There’s nothing toforgive, but I’llforgive itwhen
youjoin us."•
Herose,hedrew hertoherfeet- and!when hisarms closed about
her,their kisswasthesummation oftheif' past, itsendandtheir seal
ofacceptance.
Galtturned tothemfrom across theliving room, when theycame
out.Hehadbeen standing atawindow^ looking atthevalley—and
she feltcertain thathehadstood there allthat time. Shesaw his
eyesstudying their faces, hisglance moving slowly fromone tothe
704
other. Hisface relaxed alittle atthe sight ofthechange in
Francisco's.
Francisco smiled, asking him,“Why doyoustare atme?"
“Doyouknow whatyoulooked likewhen youcame in?"
“Oh, didl?That's because 1hadn't slept forthree nights. John,
willyouinvitemetodinner? Iwant toknowhow thisscabofyours,
gothere, but Ithink that Imight collapse sound asleep inthemiddle
ofasentence—eventhough rightnow lfeelasifIIInever needany

Galtwaswatching himwith afaint smile. “But aren't yougoing
toleave thevalley inanhour?"
“What? No . .hesaid mildly, inmomentary astonishment.
“No!" helaughed exultantly. “Idon’t have to!That's right, Ihaven't
toldyouwhat itwas,have 1? Iwassearching forDagny. For ...
forthewreck ofherplane. She’d been reported lost inacrash in
theRockies."
“1see," saidGalt quietly.
“1could have thought ofanything, except thatshewould choose
tocrash inGalt's Gulch," Francisco said happily; hehadthetone
ofthatjoyous relief which almost relishes thehorror ofthepast,
defying itbymeans ofthepresent. “Ikept flying over thedistrict
between Alton, Utah, andWinston, Colorado, over every peakand
crevice ofit,over every remnant ofacarinanygully below, and

“Then atnight,wewent outonfoot--- thesearching parties ofrail-

trying todismiss itandtosmile. “Iwouldn’t wish itonmyworst—"
Hestopped short; hissmile vanished andadim reflection ofthe
lookhehadworn forthree dayscame back tohisface, asifatthe
sudden presence ofanimage hehadforgotten.
After alongmoment, heturned toGalt. “John," hisvoicesounded
peculiarly solemn, “could wenotify those outside thatDagny is
alive ... incase there's somebody who . . .who'd feelasIdid?"
Galtwaslooking straight athim.“Doyouwish togiveanyout-
siderany relief from theconsequences ofremaining outside?"
Francisco dropped hiseyes, butanswered firmly, “No."
“Pity, Francisco?"
“Yes. Forget it.You’re right."
Galtturned away withamovement thatseemed oddly outofchar-
acter: ithadtheunrhythmical abruptness oftheinvoluntary.
Hedidnotturn back; Francisco watched him inastonishment,
thenasked softly, “What's thematter?"
Galtturned andlooked athimforamoment, notanswering. She
could notidentify theemotion thatsoftened thelines ofGalt’s face;
ithadthequality ofasmile, ofgentleness, ofpain,andofsomething
greater thatseemed tomake these concepts superfluous.
“Whatever anyofushaspaid forthisbattle," saidGalt, “you're
theonewho’s taken thehardest beating, aren’t you?"
“Who? 1?"Francisco grinned withshocked, incredulous amuse-
705
mcnt. “Certainly not!What’s thematter withyou?” Hechuckled
andadded, “Pity, John?”
“No,” saidGalt firmly.
ShesawFrancisco watching himwith alaint, puzzled frown—
because Galthadsaid it,looking, not athim, but ather.

Theemotional sum thatstruck herasanimmediate impression ot
Francisco’s house, when sheentered itlorthe firsttime, wasnotthe
sumshehadoncedrawn from thesight ofitssilent, locked exterior.
She felt,notasense of-tragic loneliness, butofinvigorating bright-
ness.Therooms were bareandcrudely simple, thehouse seemed
built with the skill, thedecisiveness andtheimpatience typical of

logwall’s pines. Inthemidst ofthatroom, Francisco’s easy, natural
manner hadatouch ofquiet pride, asifhissmile were silently saying
toher;This iswhat Iamandwhat Ihavebeen allthese years.
Shelooked upatthesilver goblets.
“Yes,” hesaid, inanswer toher silent guess, “they belonged to
Sebastian d’Anconia and hiswife. That’s theonly thing Ibrought
herefrommypalace inBuenos Aires. That, andthecrest over the
door. It’s all Iwanted tosave. Everything else willgo,inaveryfew

ofd’Anconia Copper, butthey’ll besurprised. They won't findmuch
fortheir trouble. And astothatpalace, theywon’t beable toafford
even itsheating bill.”
“And then?” sheasked. “Where willyougofrom there?”
“f? 1willgotowork ford’Anconia Copper.”
“What doyoumean?”j“Doyouremember thatoldslogan: ‘The king isdead, long live

“Kowr mine? What mine? Where?”

“Here/’ hesaid, pointing toward themountain peaks. “Didn’t you
know it?”
“No.”
“Iown acopper mine thatthelooters won’t reach, ft'shere, in

sentence- -and shemarveled atthedifference between thatsound
andtheshameful, mawkish tone, halfwhine, halt-threat, thelone of
beggar andthugcombined, which themenoftheircentury hadgiven
totheword “need.”
“Dagny,” hewassaying, standing at(hewindow, asiflooking out
atthepeaks, notofmountains, butottime, “the rebirth ofd’Anconia

ThiswastheFrancisco oftheir childhood, inbearing, inmanner,
intheunclouded brilliance ofhiseyes—andshefound herself ques-
tioning himabout hiscopper mine, asshehadquestioned himabout
hisindustrial projects ontheir walks ontheshore oftheHudson,
recapturing thesense otanunobstiucted future.

4T1Itakeyoutoseethemine,” hesaid, ‘‘assoon as*your ankle

amule trail, there's notruck road asyet.Letmeshow youthenew

toocomplex forourpresent volume ofproduction, butwhen the
mine’s output grows tojustify it—justtake alook atthetime, labor
andmoney that itwillsave!"
They were sitting together onthefloor, bending over thesheets
ofpaper hespread before her,studying theintricate sections ofthe
smelter—with thesame joyous earnestness theyhadonce brought
tothestudy ofscraps inajunk yard.
Sheleaned forward justashemoved toreach foranother sheet,
andshefound herself leaning against hisshoulder. Involuntarily, she
held stillforone instant, nolonger than forasmall break inthe
flowofasingle motion, while hereyes rose tohis.Hewaslooking
down ather, neither hiding what hefeltnorimplying anyfurther
demand. Shedrew back, knowing thatshehad feltthesame desire
ashis.
Then, stillholding therecaptured sensation ofwhat shehad telt
forhimmthepast, shegrasped aquality thathadalways been part
ofit,nowsuddenly clear toherforthe firsttime: ifthatdesire was
acelebration ofone's life,thenwhat shehad feltforFrancisco had
always been acelebration ofherfuture, likeamoment ofsplendor
gained inpartpayment ofanunknown total, affirming some promise
tocome. Intheinstant when shegrasped it.sheknew alsotheonly
desire shehadeverexperienced notintoken olthefuture butof
the fulland final present. Sheknew itbymeans ofanimage—the
image ofaman’s figure standing atthedoor ofasmall granite struc-
ture.The finalform ofthepromise thathadkept heimoving, she
thought, wasthemanwhowould, perhaps, remain apromise novel
tobereached.
But this—shethought inconsternation —was thatview ofhuman
destiny which shehadmost passionately haled andrejected: theview
thatmanwasever tobedrawn bysome vision oftheunattainable
shining ahead, doomed ever toaspire, butnottoachieve. Her file
andhervalues could notbring hertothat, shethought; shehad
never found beauty inlonging fortheimpossible andhadnever
found thepossible tobebeyond herreach. Butshehadcome toit
andshecould findnoanswer.
Shecould notgivehimuporgiveuptheworld-shethought,
looking atGalt, thatevening. Theanswer seemed harder tofind in
hispresence. She teltthatnoproblem existed, thatnothing could
stand beside thefactotseeing hitnandnothing would everhave the
power tomake herleave—and,simultaneously, thatshewould have
noright tolook athim ifshewere to,renounce herrailroad. She
feltthatsheowned him, that theunnhmed hadbeen understood
between them from thestart—and,simultaneously, thathewasable
tovanish from her lifeand,onsome future street oftheoutside
world, topassherbyinunweighted indifference.
Shenoted thathedidnotquestion herabout Francisco. When she
spoke ofher visit, shecould findnoreaction inhisface, neither of
708
approval norofresentment. Itseemed toherthatshecaught an
imperceptible shading inhisgravely attentive expression: helooked
asifthiswere amatter about which hedidnotchoose tofeel
Her faintapprehension grew intoaquestion mark, andtheques-
tionmark turned intoadrill cutting deeper anddeeper intoher
mind through theevenings thatfollowed—when Galt leftthehouse
andsheremained alone.Hewent outevery other night, after dinner,
nottelling herwhere hewent, returning atmidnight orlater. She
tried nottoallow herself fully todiscover withwhat tension and
restlessness shewaited forhisreturn. Shedidnotaskhimwhere he
spent hisevenings. The reluctance thatstopped herwashertoo
urgent desire toknow; shekept silent insome dimly intentional form
ofdefiance, half indefiance ofhim, halfofherown anxiety.
Shewould notacknowledge thethings shefeared orgivethem
thesolid shape ofwords, sheknew them onlybytheugly, nagging
pullofanunadmitted emotion. Partofitwasasavage resentment,
ofakind shehadnever experienced before, which washeranswer
tothedread thatthere might beawoman inhislife;yettheresent-
mentwassoftened bysome quality ofhealth inthething shefeared,
asifthethreat could befought andeven, ifneed be,accepted. But
therewasanother, uglier dread; thesordid shape ofself-sacnfice, the
suspicion, nottobeuttered about him, thathewished toremove
himself from herpathand let itsemptiness force herback tothe
manwhowas hisbest-loved friend.
Days passed before shespoke of it.Then, atdinner, onanevening
when hewas toleave, shebecame suddenly aware ofthepeculiar
pleasure sheexperienced while watching him eatthefood shehad
prepared—andsuddenly, involuntarily, asifthatpleasure gave her
aright shedared notidentify, asifenjoyment, notpain, broke her
resistance, sheheard herself asking him,“What isityou’re doing
every' other evening?”
Heanswered simply, asifhehadtaken forgranted thatsheknew
it,“Lecturing.”
“What?”
“Giving acourse oflectures onphysics, as Idoevery yearduring
thismonth. It'smy . . .What areyoulaughing at?”heasked, seeing
thelook ofrelief, ofsilent laughter thatdidnotseem tobedirected
athiswords—andthen, before sheanswered, hesmiled suddenly, as
ifhehadguessed theanswer, shesawsome particular, intensely
personat quality inhissmile, which wasalmost aquality ofinsolent
intimacy— incontrast tothecalmly impersonal, casual manner with
which hewent on.“Youknow that this isthemonth whenweall
trade theachievements ofourrealprofessions. Richard Halley isto

thorswhodonotwrite fortheoutside world—and 1give lectures,

“Free lectures?”
“Certainly not. It'stendollars perperson forthecourse.”
“Iwant tohearyou.”
Heshook hishead. “No. You’ll beallowed toattend theconcerts,

whohave apractical purpose intakingmycourse: Dwight Sanders,
Lawrence Hammond, DickMcNamara, Owen Kellogg, afewothers.
I’veadded onebeginner thisyear: Quentin Daniels.”
‘"Really?” shesaid, almost with atouch ofjealousy. “How canhe
afford anything thatexpensive?”
“On credit. I’vegiven himatime-payment plan. He’sworth it.”
“Where doyoulecture?”
“Inthehangar, onDwight Sanders’ farm.”
“And where doyouwork during theyear'*”
“Inmylaboratory.”
Sheasked cautiously, “Where isyour laboratory? Here, inthe
valley?”
Heheldhereyes foramoment, letting herseethat hisglance was
amused and thatheknew herpurpose, thenanswered, “No.”
“You’ve lived intheoutside world forallofthese twelve Years?”
“Yes.”
“Doyou”— thethought seemed unbearable— “doyouholdsome
suchjobastheothers?”
“Oh yes.”Theamusement inhiseyesseemed stressed bysome
special meaning.
“Don't tellmethatyou’re asecond assistant bookkeeper!”
“No, I’mnot.”
“Then whatdoyoudo?”
“Ihold thekind o(jobthattheworld wishes metohold.”
“Where?”
Heshook hishead. “No, Miss Taggart. Ityoudecide toleave the
valley, this isoneofthethings thatyouarenottoknow.”
Hesmiled again with that insolently personal quality which now
seemed tosaythatheknew thethreat contained inhisanswer and
what itmeant toher,thenherosefrom thetable.
When hehadgone, she feltasifthemotion oftimewere an
oppressive weight inthestillness ofthehouse, likeastationary, half-
solidmass slithering slowly intosome faint elongation byatempo
that lefthernomeasure toknow whether minutes hadpassed or
hours. Shelayhalf-stretched inanarmchair oftheliving room, crum-
pled bythat heavy, indifferent lassitude which isnotthe will to
laziness, butthefrustration ofthewilltoasecret violence thatno
lesser action can satisfy.
That special pleasure shehad feltinwatching him eatthefood
shehadprepared—shethought, lying still,hereyes closed, hermind
moving, like time, through some realm ofveiled slowness- -ithad
been thepleasure ofknowing that.sh£hadprovided him with a
sensual enjoyment, thatoneform ofhisfoody’s satisfaction hadcome
from her. .. .There isreason, shethought, why awoman, would
wish tocook foraman . ..oh,notasaduty, notasachronic career,
only asarareand special rite insymbol of . . .butwhat have
theymade ofit,thepreachers ofwoman’s duty? . . .Thecastrated
performance ofasickening drudgery washeld tobeawoman’s
proper virtue—while thatwhich gave itmeaning andsanction was
710
held asashameful sin ...thework ofdealing with grease, steam
andslimy peelings inarecking kitchen washeld tobeaspiritual
matter, anactofcompliance withhermoral duty—while themeeting
oftwobodies inabedroom washeld tobeaphysical indulgence,
anactofsurrender toananimal instinct, withnoglory, meaning or
pride ofspirit tobeclaimed bytheanimals involved.
Sheleaped abruptly toher feet.Shedidnotwant tothink ofthe
outer world orofitsmoral code. Butsheknew that thatwasnot
thesubject ofherthoughts. And shedidnotwant tothink ofthe
subject hermindwasintent onpursuing, thesubject towhich itkept
returning against her will,bysome willofitsown. ...
Shepaced theroom, hating theugly, jerky, uncontrolled looseness
ofhermovements—tornbetween theneed tolethermotion break
thestillness, andtheknowledge that thiswasnottheform ofbreak
shewanted. Shelighted cigarettes, foraninstant’s illusion ofpur*
poseful action—anddiscarded them within another instant, feeling
theweary distaste ofasubstitute purpose. Shelooked attheroom
likearestless beggar, pleading with physical objects togivehera
motive, wishing shecould findsomething todean, tomend, topol-
ish-while knowing thatnotaskwasworth theeffort.When nothing
seems worth theeffort—saidsome stern voice inhermind—it’sa
screen tohide awish that’s worth toomuch; whatdoyouwant? .. .
Shesnapped amatch, viciously jerking theflame tothe tipofa
cigarette shenoticed hanging, unlighted, inthecorner ofher
mouth. . . .What doyouwant?—repeated thevoice thatsounded
severe asajudge. Iwanthimtocome back!—sheanswered, throwing
thewords, asasoundless cry, atsome accuser within her.almost as
onewould throw abone toapursuing beast, inthehope ofdis-
ttacting itfrompouncing upon the rest.
Iwanthimback— shesaid softly, inanswer totheaccusation that
there wasnoreason lorsogreat animpatience. . . Iwanthim
back—shesaid pleadingly, inanswer tothecoldreminder thather
answer didnotbalance thejudge’s scale. ... Iwanthimback!—she
cried defiantly, lighting nottodrop theonesuperfluous, protective
word inthatsentence.
She feltherhead drooping with exhaustion, asafter aprolonged
beating. The cigarette shesawbetween herfingers hadburned the
mere length ofhalfaninch. Sheground itoutand fellintothe
armchair again.
I'mnotevading it—shethought—I’mnotevading it,it’sjastthat
1canseenowaytoanyanswer. . ..Thatwhich youwant—saidthe
voice, while shestumbled through athickening fog—isyours forthe

andwould nothear her—lethimdamnmetomorrow. ... 1want
him . . .back. ...Sheheard noanswer, because herheadhad
fallen softly against thechair; shewasasleep.
When sheopened hereyes, shesawhimstanding three feetaway,
looking down ather,asifhehadbeen watching herforsome time.
Shesaw hisfaceand,with theclarity ofundivided perception, she
711
sawthemeaning oftheexpression onhisface: itwasthemeaning
shehadfought forhours. Shesaw itwithout astonishment, because
shehadnotyetregained herawareness ofanyreason why itshould
astonish her.
“This isthewayyoulook,” hesaid softly, “when you fallasleep
inyour office/' andsheknew that he,too,wasnotfullyaware of
letting herhear it:thewayhesaid ittoldherhow often hehad
thought ofitandforwhat reason. “You look asifyouwould awaken
inaworld where youhadnothing tohideortofear,” andsheknew
thatthe firstmovement ofherfacehadbeen asmile, sheknew it
inthemoment when itvanished, when shegrasped thattheywere
both awake. Headded quietly, with fullawareness, “But here, it’s
true.”
Her firstemotion oftherealm ofreality wasasense ofpower.
She satupwith aflowing, leisurely movement ofconfidence, feeling
theflowofthemotion frommuscle tomuscle through herbody. She
asked, and itwastheslowness, thesound ofcasual curiosity, the
tone oftaking theimplications forgranted, thatgave tohervoice
thefaintest sound ofdisdain, “How didyouknow what Ilook like
in . ..myoffice?”
“Itoldyouthat I'vewatched youforyears.”
“How wereyouable towatchmethatthoroughly? From where?”
“Iwillnotanswer younow,” hesaid, simply, without defiance.
The slightmovement ofhershoulder leaning back, thepause, then
thelower, huskier tone ofhervoice, leftahintofsmiling triumph
totrailbehind herwords: “When didyouseemeforthe firsttime?”
“Ten years ago,” heanswered, looking straight ather, letting her
seethathewasanswering thefull,unnamed meaning ofherquestion.
“Where?” Theword wasalmost acommand.
Hehesitated, thenshesawafaint smile thattouched only hislips,
nothiseyes, thekind ofsmile from which onecontemplates— with
longing, bitterness andpride—apossession purchased atanexcruci-
ating cost; hiseyesseemed directed, not ather,butatthe girlof
that time. “Underground, intheTaggart Terminal,” heanswered.
Shebecame suddenly conscious ofherposture: shehad lether
shoulder blades slidedown against thechair, carelessly, half-lying,
onelegstretched forward—andwithhersternly tailored, transparent
blouse, herwide peasant skirt hand-printed inviolent colors, her
thinstocking andhigh-heeled pump, shedidnotlook likearailroad
executive—theconsciousness ofitstruck her inanswer tohiseyes
thatseemed tobeseeing theunattainable —shelooked like that
which shewas: hisservant girl.Sheknew themoment when some
faintest stress ofthebrilliance inhisdark green eyesremoved the
veilofdistance, replacing thevision ofthepastbytheactofseeing
herimmediate person. Shemet hisey$s with that insolent glance
which isasmile without movement offacial muscles.
Heturned away, butashemoved across theroom hissteps were
aseloquent asthesound ofavoice. Slheknew thathewanted to
leave theroom, ashealways left it,he*had never stayed forlonger
thanabriefgood nightwhen hecamehome. Shewatched thecourse
ofhisstruggle, whether bymeans ofhissteps, begun inonedirection
712
andswerving inanother, orbymeans ofhercertainty thatherbody
hadbecome aninstrument forthedirect perception ofhis,likea
screen reflecting bothmovements andmotives—shecould not tell.
Sheknew only thathewhohadnever started orlostabattle against
himself, nowhadnopower toleave thisroom.
Hismanner seemed toshow nosignofstrain. Hetook offhis
coat, throwing itaside, remaining inshirt sleeves, and satdown,
facing her, atthewindow across theroom. Buthesatdown onthe
armofachair, asifhewere neither leaving norstaying.
She feltthelight-headed, theeasy, thealmost frivolous sensation
oftriumph intheknowledge thatshewasholding himassurely as
byaphysical touch; forthelength ofamoment, briefanddangerous
toendure, itwasamore satisfying form ofcontact.
Then she feltasudden, blinding shock, which washalfblow, half-
scream within her,andshegroped, stunned, for itscause—only to
realize thathehadleaned alittle toonesideand ithadbeenno
more than thesight ofanaccidental posture, ofthelong linerunning
from hisshoulder totheangle ofhiswaist, tohiships,down his
legs.Shelooked away, nottolethimseethatshewastrembling—
andshedropped allthoughts oftriumph andofwhose wasthe
power.
“I’ve seenyoumany times since.’* hesaid, quietly, steadily, buta
littlemore slowly than usual, asifhecould control everything except
hisneed tospeak.
“Where haveyouseenme?”
“Many places”
“Butyoumade certain toremain unseen?” Sheknew that hiswas
afaceshecould nothave failed tonotice.,
“Yes.”
“Why? Were youafiaid?"
“Yes.”
Hesaid itsimply, and ittook heramoment torealize thathewas
admitting heknew what thesight olhisperson would havemeant to
her.“Didyouknowwho lwas,when yousawmeforthe firsttime?”
“Oh yes.Myworstenemy butone.”
“What?” Shehad notexpected it;sheadded, more quietly.
“Who’s theworst one?”
“Dr.Robert Stadler”
“Did youhavemeclassified withhim?”
“No. He’smyconscious enemy. He’s themanwho sold hissoul.
Wedon’t intend toreclaim him.You—youwereoneofus. Iknew
it,longbefore 1sawyou, Iknew also thatyouwould bethe lastto
joinusandthehardest onetodeteat.”
“Who toldyouthat?”
“Francisco.”
She letamoment pass, then asked, “What didhesay?”
“He said thatofallthenames onour list,you'd betheonemost
difficult towin.Thatwaswhen Iheard ofyouforthe firsttime. It
wasFrancisco whoputyourname onour list.Hetoldmethatyou
were thesolehope and future ofTaggart Transcontinental, that
you’d stand against usforalong time, thatyou'd fight adesperate
713
battle foryour railroad—because youhadtoomuch endurance, cour-
ageandconsecration toyourwork.” Heglanced ather.“He told
menothing else.Hespoke ofyou asifhewere merely discussing
oneofourfuture strikers. Iknew thatyouandhehadbeen child-
hood friends, thatwas all.”
“When didyouseeme?”
“Two years later,”
“How?”
“Bychance. Itwas late atnight ...onapassenger platform of
theTaggart Terminal.” Sheknew that thiswasaform ofsurrender,
hedidnotwant tosay it,yethehadtospeak, sheheard both the
muted intensity andthepullofresistance inhisvoice—hehadto
speak, because hehad togive himself andher thisoneform of
contact. “You wore anevening gown.Youhadacape half-slipping
offyourbody—Isaw, atfirst, onlyyour bare shoulders, yourback
andyour profile—itlooked foramoment asifthecapewould slip
further andyouwould stand there naked. Then 1sawthatyouwore
alonggown, thecolor ofice, likethetunic ofaGrecian goddess,
butyouhadtheshort hairandtheimperious profile ofanAmerican
woman. Youlooked preposterously outofplaceonarailroad plat-
form—and itwasnotonarailroad platform that 1wasseeing you,
Iwasseeing asetting thathadnever haunted mebefore—butthen,
suddenly, 1knew thatyoudidbelong among the rails, thesootand
thegirders, that thatwastheproper setting foraflowing gown and
naked shoulders and aface asaiive asyours—arailroad platform,
notacurtained apartment—youlooked likeasymbol ofluxury and
youbelonged intheplace thatwas itssource —you seemed tobring
wealth, grace, extravagance andtheenjoyment oflifeback totheir
rightful owners, tothemenwho created railroads and factories—
youhadalook ofenergy andofitsreward, together, alook of
competence andluxury combined—and 1wasthe firstmanwhohad
ever stated inwhat manner these twowere inseparable—and 1
thought that ifouragegaveform toitsproper godsanderected a

statue. . ..Then Isawwhatyouwere doing—and Iknewwhoyou
were.Youwere giving orders tothree Terminal officials. Icould not
hearyour words, butyour voice sounded swift, clear-cut andconfi-
dent. 1knew thatyouwereDagny Taggart. Icame closer, close
enough toheartwosentences. ‘Who saidso?'asked oneofthemen.
‘Idid,’youanswered. Thatwas all Iheard. Thatwasenough.”
“And then?”
Heraised hiseyes slowly tohold hers across theroom, andthe
submerged intensity thatpulled hisvoice down, blurring itstone to
softness, gave itasound ofself-mockery thatwasdesperate and
almost gentle: “Then Iknew thatabandoning mymotor wasnotthe
hardest price Iwould have topayforthisstrike.”
Shewondered which anonymous shapow—among thepassengers
whohadhurried past her,asinsubstantial asthesteam oftheengines
andasignored—which shadow and fac<$hadbeen his;shewondered
how close shehadcome tohim forthelength ofthatunknown
moment. “Ob,why didn't youspeak tome,then orlater?”
714
“Doyouhappen toremember whatyouweredoing intheTermi-
nalthatnight?”
“Iremember vaguely anight when they calledmefromsome

nalmanager hadmadesome sortoferror thattiedupalltraffic inthe
tunnels. Theoldmanager hadquitunexpectedly theweek before.”
‘itwas Iwhomade himquit.”
“Isee ...”
Her voice trailed off, as ifabandoning sound, ashereyelids
dropped, abandoning sight. Ifhehadnotwithstood itthen—she
thought—ifhehadcome toclaim her,then orlater, what sortof
tragedy would theyhavehad toreach? . . .Sheremembered what
shehad feltwhen shehadcried thatshewould shoot thedestroyer

wished hehadcome toher,because thethought nottobeadmitted
intohermind, butflowing asadarkwarmth through herbody, was:
1would have shothim,butnotbefore—
She raised hereyelids—andsheknew that thatthought wasas
naked tohim inhereyes, as itwastoher inhis.Shesaw hisveiled
glance andthetautness ofhismouth, shesawhimreduced toagony,
she feltherself drowned bytheexultant wish tocause himpain, to
see it,towatch it,towatch itbeyond herownendurance and his,
then toreduce him tothehelplessness oipleasure.
Hegotup,helooked away, andshecould not tellwhether itwas
theslight liltofhishead orthetension ofhisfeatures thatmade his
face look oddly calm and clear, asifitwere stripped ofemotion
down tothenaked purity ofitsstructure.
"Every man thatyoui railroad needed and lost inthepast ten
years,” hesaid, “itwas lwhomade you losehim.” Hisvoice had
thesinglctoned Halnessandtheluminous simplicity ofanaccountant
whoreminds areckless purchaser that cost isanabsolute which
cannot beescaped, ihave pulled cveiy girder from under Taggart
Transcontinental and, ifyouchoose togoback, Iwillsee itcollapse

Heturned toleave theroom. Shestopped him. Itwashervoice,
more thanherwords, thatmade him stop* hervoice waslow, ithad
noquality ofemotion, onlyofasinking weight, and itssolecolorwas
some dragging undertone, likeaninner echo, resembling athreat; it
wasthevoice ofthepicaofaperson who stillretains aconcept of
honor, but islong pastcaring for it:
"You want toholdmehere, don't you?”
“More thananything else intheworld.”
“You could holdme.”
“Iknow it.”
Hisvoice hadsaid itwith thesame sound ashers.Hewaited, to
regain hisbreath. When hespoke, hisvoicewaslowand clear, with
some stressed quality ofawareness, which wasalmost thequality of
asmile ofunderstanding:
715
“It’syouracceptance ofthisplace that Iwant, Whatjjood would
itdome,tohave your physical presence without anymeaning?
That’s thekind offaked reality bywhich most people cheat them-
selves oftheir lives.Tmnotcapable ofit.’*Heturned togo.“And
neither areyou.Good night, Miss Taggart.”
Hewalked out, into hisbedroom, closing thedoor.
Shewaspasttherealm ofthought—asshelayinbed inthedark-
ness ofherroom, unable tothink ortosleep—andthemoaning
violence that filled hermindseemed only asensation ofhermuscles,
but itstoneand itstwisting shades were likeapleading cry,which

Richard Halley stopped playing, turned away from thepiano and
glanced atDagny. Hesawherdrop herfacewith theinvoluntary
movement ofhiding toostrong anemotion, herose, smiled andsaid
softly, “Thank you.’’
“Ohno . ..'*shewhispered, knowing thatthegratitude washeis
and that itwas futile toexpress it.Shewasthinking oftheyears

inhissmall cottage onaledge ofthevalley, when allthisprodigal
magnificence ofsound wasbeing shaped byhimasaflowing menu
ment toaconcept which equates thesdnse oflifewith thesease of

ahopeless quest forsome form ofenjoyment, with thescreeches of
716
amodern symphony running after her, asifspitbytheinfected
throat ofaloud-speaker coughing itsmalicious hatred ofexistence.
“But 1mean it,”saidRichard Halley, smiling. ‘Tm abusinessman

Sheraised herhead.Hestood inthemiddle ofhisliving room,
theywere alone, with thewindow open tothesummer night, tothe
dark treesonalongsweep ofledges descending toward theglitter
ofthevalley’s distant lights.
“Miss Taggart, howmany people arethere towhom mywork

“Not many.” sheanswered simply, neither asboast nor flattery,
hutasanimpersonal tribute totheexacting values involved.
“That isthepayment Idemand. Notmany canafford it. 1don’t
mean your enjoyment, Idon’t mean your emotion—emotions be
damned’- mean your understanding andthefactthatyour enjoy-
mentwas otthesame nature asmine, that itcame from thesame

went towrite it—1mean, notthefact thatyou felt,butthatyou felt
what /wished you tofeel, notthefactthatyouadmire mywork,
butthatyouadmire itforthethings /wished tobeadmired.” He
chuckled. “There's onlyonepassion inmost artists more violent than
their desire lotadmiration: their fear otidentifying thenature of

Idonottoolmyself aboutmywork ortheresponse Iseek— 1value

Anartist isatrader. Miss Taggart, thehardest andmost exacting of
alltraders. Nowdoyouunderstand me?”
“Yes,” shesaid incredulously, “1do,” incredulously because she
washearing herownsymbol ofmoral pride, chosen byaman she

“Ifyoudo.whydidyoulook quite sotragic just amoment ago?

“The yearswhen yourwork hasremained unheard.”

slowly intoearnestness, asunder thetideofsome unspoken contem-

Itwastrue—shethought, when shewalked through thestreets of
thevalley, looking with achild’s excitement attheshopwindows
sparkling inthesun—that thebusinesses herehadthepurposeful
selectiveness otart—andthat theart—shethought, when shesatin
thedarkness ofaclapboard concert hall, listening tothecontrolled
violence andthemathematical precision ofHalley’s music— hadthe
stern discipline ofbusiness.
Bothhadtheradiance ofengineering -shethought, when shesat
among rows ofbenches under theopen sky,watching KayLudlow
onthestage. Itwasanexperience shehadnotknown since child-
hood— theexperience ofbeing held forthree hours byaplay that
told astory shehadnotseen before, inlines shehadnotheard,
uttering atheme thathadnotbeen picked from thehand-me-downs
ofthecenturies. Itwastheforgotten delight ofbeing held inrapt
attention bytherents oftheingenious, theunexpected, thelogical,
thepurposeful, thenew-and ofseeing itembodied inaperformance
ofsuperlative artistry byawoman playing acharacter whose beauty
ofspirit matched herown physical perfection.
“That's whyI’mhere. MissTaggart,” saidKayLudlow, smiling in
answer tohercomment, alter theperformance. “Whatever quality
olhuman greatness 1have thetalent toportray—thatwasthequality
theouter world sought todegrade. They letmeplaynothing but
symbols ofdepravity, nothing but harlots, dissipation-chasers and
home-wreckers, always tobebeaten attheendbythe little girlnext
door, personifying thevirtue ofmediocrity. They usedmytalent—
lorthedefamation ofitself. Thatwaswhy Iquit.”
Not since childhood, thought Dagny, hadshe feltthatsense of
exhilaiatiun after witnessing theperformance ofaplay— thesense
that lifeheld things worth reaching, notthesense ofhaving studied
some aspect ofasewer there hadbeennoreason tosee.Asthe
audience tiledaway into thedarkness from thelighted rows of
benches, shenoticed EllisWyatt, Judge Narragansett, KenDanagger,
menwhohadoncebeen said todespise allforms ofart.
The lastimage shecaught, thatevening, wasthesight oftwo tall,
straight, slender figures walking away together down aHailamong
therocks, with thebeam ofaspotlight gashing onceonthegold of
their hair.They wereKayLudlow andRagnar Danneskjdld— and
shewondered whether shecould bear toreturn toaworld where
these were thetwodoomed todestruction.
Therecaptured sense ofherownchildhood keptcoming back to
herwhenever shemetthetwosonsoftheyoungwoman whoowned
thebakery shop. Sheoften sawthem wandeiing down the trails of
thevalley—two fearless beings, aged seven and four.Theyseemed
tolace lifeasshehadlaced it.They didnothave thelookshehad
seenmthechildren oftheouter world—alookoffear, half-secretive,
half-sneering, thelookofachild’s defense against anadult, thelook
ofabeing intheprocess ofdiscovering thatheishearing liesandof
learning tofeelhatred. Thetwoboyshadtheopen, joyous, friendly
confidence ofkittens whodonotexpect togethurt, theyhadan

innocently natural, non-ooastrut sense ortneirownvarne anaasin-
nocent atrust inanystranger’s ability torecognize it,theyhadthe
eager curiosity thatwould venture anywhere with thecertainty that

asif,should theyencounter malevolence, theywould reject itcon-
temptuously, notasdangerous,, butasstupid, theywould notaccept
itinbruised resignation asthelawofexistence.
“They represent myparticular career. Miss Taggart,” said the
young mother inanswer tohercomment, wrapping aloafoffresh
bread andsmiling atheracross thecounter. “They’re theprofession
I’vechosen topractice, which, inspite otalltheguffabout mother-
hood, onecan’t practice successfully intheouter world. Ibelieve
you’ve metmyhusband, he'stheteacher ofeconomics whoworks
aslinesman forDickMcNamara. Youknow, ofcourse, that there
canbenocollective commitments inthisvalley andthatfamilies or
relatives arenotallowed tocome here, unless eachperson takes the
striker’s oathbyhisownindependent conviction. 1came here, not
merely forthesake ofmyhusband’s profession, butforthesake of
myown. Icame here inorder tobring upmysons ashuman beings.
Iwould notsurrender them totheeducational systems devised to
stunt achild’s brain, toconvince him thatreason isimpotent, that
existence isanirrational chaos withwhich he’sunable todeal,and
thus reduce him toastate ofchronic terror. Youmarvel atthe
difference between mychildren andthose outside. Miss Taggart?
Yetthecause issosimple. Thecause isthat here, inGalt’s Gulch,
there’s noperson whowould notconsider itmonstrous ever tocon-
front achild withtheslightest suggestion oftheirrational.”
Shethought oftheteachers whom theschools oftheworld had
lost—when shelooked atthethree pupils ofDr,Akston, onthe
evening oftheir yearly reunion.
Theonlyother guest hehadinvited wasKayLudlow. The sixof
them salintheback yard ofhishouse, with thelight ofthesunset
ontheir faces, andthefloor ofthevalley condensing intoasoftblue
vapor farbelow.
Shelooked athispupils, atthethree pliant, agile figures half-
stretched oncanvas chairs inposes ofrelaxed contentment, dressed
inslacks, windbreakers andopen-collared shirts: John Galt, Fran-
cisco d’Anconia, Ragnar DanneskjOld.
“Don’t beastonished, Miss Taggart,” said Dr.Akston, smiling,
“and don’tmake themistake ofthinking thatthese three pupils of
mine aresome sort ofsuperhuman creatures. They’re something
much greater andmore astounding thaq that: they’re normal men—
athing theworld hasnever seen—and tljjeir feat isthattheymanaged
tosurvive assuch, itdoes takeanexceptional mindandastillmore
exceptional integrity toremain untoueped bythebrain-destroying
influences oftheworld's doctrines, thdaccumulated evilofcentu-
ries—toremain human,since thehumajjn istherational.”
She feltsomenew quality inDr.Alton’s attitude, some change
inthesternness ofhisusual reserve; heseemed toinclude her in
their circle, asifsheweremore thanaguest. Francisco acted asif
herpresence attheir reunion were natural andtobetaken gaily for
720
granted. Galt’s facegavenohintofanyreaction; hismanner was
thatofacourteous escort whohadbrought herhere atDr.Aks-
ton’s request.
Shenoticed thatDr.Akston’s eyeskeptcoming back toher,asif
with thequiet pride ofdisplaying hisstudents toanappreciative
observer. Hisconversation kept returning toasingle theme, inthe
manner ofafather whohasfound alistener interested inhismost
cherished subject:
“You should have seen them, when theywere incollege. Miss
Taggart. You couldn’t havefound three boys ‘conditioned’ tosuch
different backgrounds, but— conditioners bedamned!—theymust
have picked oneanother atfirst sight,among thethousands onthat
campus. Francisco, therichest heir intheworld—Ragnar, theEuro-
pean aristocrat— andJohn, theself-made man, self-made inevery
sense, outofnowhere, penniless, parentless, tie-less. Actually, hewas
thesonofagas-station mechanic atsome forsaken crossroads in
Ohio, andhehad lefthome attheageoftwelve tomake hisown
way—but I’vealways thought ofhim asifhehadcome into the
world likeMinerva, thegoddess ofwisdom, whosprang forth from
Jupiter’s head, fullygrown and fullyarmed. . . .Iremember theday
when Isawthethree ofthem forthe first time.They were sitting
attheback oftheclassroom— 1wasgiving aspecial course forpost-
graduate students, sodifficult acourse thatfewoutsiders ever ven-
tured toattend these particular lectures. Those three looked too
young even forfreshmen —they were sixteen atthetime, asflearned
later. Attheendofthat lecture, John gotuptoaskmeaquestion.
Itwasaquestion which, asateacher, 1would havebeenproud to
hearfrom astudent who’d taken sixyears ofphilosophy. Itwasa
question pertaining toPlato’s metaphysics, which Plato hadn’t had
thesense toaskofhimself. Iansweied— and Iasked John tocome
tomyoffice after thelecture. Hecame—allthree ofthemcame—I
sawthetwoothers inmyanteroom and letthem in. Italked tothem
foranhour—then Icancelled allmyappointments andtalked to
them fortherestoftheday.Alter which, Iarranged toletthem
take thatcourse andreceive their credits for it.They took thecourse.
Fhey gotthehighest grades intheclass. ...They were majoring in
twosubjects: physics andphilosophy. Their choice amazed everybody
butme:modem thinkers considered itunnecessary toperceive real-
ity,andmodern physicists considered itunnecessary tothink. Iknew
better; whatamazed mewas that these children knew it,too. ...
Robert Stadler washead oftheDepartment ofPhysics, as lwas
head oftheDepartment ofPhilosophy. Heand 1suspended allrules
and restrictions forthese three students, wespared them allthe
routine, unessential courses, weloaded them with nothing butthe
hardest tasks, andwccleared theirway tomajor inourtwosubjects
within their four years. They worked for it.And, during those four
years, theyworked fortheir living, besides. Francisco andRagnar
were receiving allowances from their parents, Johnhadnothing, but
allthree ofthem held part-time jobs tocam theirownexperience
andmoney, Francisco worked inacopper foundry, Johnworked in
arailroad roundhouse, andRagnar—no.Miss Taggart, Ragnar was

asclerk intheuniversity library. They hadtime foreverything they
wanted, butnotime forpeople orforanycommunal campus activi-
ties.They .. .Ragnar!” heinterrupted himself suddenly, sharply.
“Don’t sitontheground!”
Danneskjbld hadslipped down andwasnow sitting onthegrass,
with hishead leaning against KayLudlow’s knees.Herose obedi-
ently, chuckling. Dr.Akston smiled with atouch ofapology.
'it’sanoldhabit ofmine,” heexplained toDagny. “A‘condi-
tioned’ reflex, Iguess. Iused totellhim that inthose college years,
whenFdcatchhim sitting ontheground inmyback yard,oncold,
foggy evenings—hewasreckless thatway, hemademeworry, he
should haveknown itwasdangerous and—”
Hestopped abruptly; heread inDagny’s startled eyes thesame
thought ashisown: thethought ofthekind ofdangers theadult
Ragnar hadchosen toface. Dr.Akston shrugged, spreading his
hands inagesture ofhelpless self-mockery. KayLudlow smiled at
him inunderstanding.
”Myhouse stood justoutside thecampus,” hecontinued, sighing,
“onatallbluff overLake Erie.Wcspentmany evenings together,

offintoapeacefully unlimited distance. Ihad towork harder on
those nights than inanyclassroom, answering allthequestions they'd
askme,discussing thekind ofissues they’d raise. About midnight,
Iwould fixsome hotchocolate andforcethem todrink it—theone
thing Isuspected was thattheynever took time toeatproperly—
andthenwe’dgoontalking, while thelakevanished intosolid dark-
nessandtheskyseemed lighter than theearth. There were atew

turning darker andthelakewasgrowing paleandwewere within a
fewsentences ofdaylight. Ishould haveknown better, 1knew that
they weren’t getting enough sleep asitwas,but Iforgot itoccasion-
ally, 1lostmysense oftime—yousee,when theywere there, Ialways
feltasifitwere earlymorning andalong, inexhaustible daywere
stretching ahead before us.They never spoke ofwhat theywished
theymight dointhefuture, they never wondered whether some
mysterious omnipotence hadfavored them withsome unknowable
talent toachieve thethings theywanted—theyspoke ofwhat they
would do.Does affection tend tomake oneacoward? Iknow that
theonly times Ifeltfearwere occasional moments when 1listened
tothemandthought ofwhat theworld wasbecoming andwhat they
would have toencounter inthefuture; Fear? Yes-but itwasmore
than fear. Itwasthekind ofemotion2thatmakes mencapable ol

todestroy these children, thatthese th^ee sonsofmineweremarked

horror, pushed bythehand ofevery would-be decent manwhobe-
lieved thatneed isholier than ability, andpity isholier than justice.
Butthese were only occasional moments. Itwasnotmyconstant
feeling. Ilistened tomychildren and lknew thatnothing would
defeat them. Ilooked atthem, asthey satinmyback yard, and
beyond myhouse there were the tall,dark buildings ofwhat was
stillamonument tounenslaved thought— thePatrick Henry Univer-
sity—andfarther inthedistance there were thelights ofCleveland,
theorange glow ofsteel mills behind batteries ofsmokestacks, the
twinkling reddots ofradio towers, thelongwhite raysofairports
ontheblack edge ofthesky—and Ithought that inthename ofany
greatness thathadever existed andmoved thisworld, thegreatness
ofwhich theywere the lastdescendants, theywould win.... I
remember onenightwhen 1noticed thatJohnhadbeen silent fora

stillaliveenough tograsp atthese three students. ‘Grasp’ wasthe
word for it.Intelligence being theonly value heworshipped, he
clutched them asiftheywere aprivate treasure ofhisown.Hehad
always been avery lonely man. Ithink that inthewhole ofhis life,
Francisco andRagnar were hisonly love,andJohn was hisonly
passion. ItwasJohnwhom heregarded ashisparticular heir, ashis
future, ashisown immortality. John intended tobeaninventor,
which meant thathewastobeaphysicist; hewastotake hispost-

both ofus,histwointellectual fathers: anindustrialist. AndRagnar—
youdidn’t know what profession Ragnar hadchosen. MissTaggart?
No, itwasn't stunt pilot, orjungle explorer, ordeep-sea diver. Itwas
something much more courageous than these. Ragnar intended to
beaphilosopher. An abstract, theoretical, academic, cloistered,
ivory-tower philosopher. . . .Yes,Robert Stadlcr loved them.And

D’Anconia Copper No. 1wasasmall cutonthefaceofthemoun-
tain, thatlooked asifaknife hadmade atewangular slashes, leaving
shelves ofrock, redasawound, onthereddish-brown flank. The
sunbeatdown upon it.Dagny stood attheedge otapath, holding
ontoGalt's armonone sideand toFrancisco's ontheother, the
wind blowing against their faces andoutover thevalley, twothou-
sand feetbelow.
This—she thought, looking atthemine—wasthestory ofhuman
wealth written across themountains: atewpine treeshung over the
cut,contorted bythestorms thathadraged through thewilderness
forcenturies, sixmenworked ontheshelves, andaninordinate
amount ofcomplex machinery traced delicate lines against thesky;
themachinery didmost ofthework.
Shenoticed thatFrancisco wasdisplaying hisdomain toGalt as
much astoher, asmuch ormore. “You haven't seen itsince last
year, John. . . .John, wait tillyousee itayearfrom now. FI!be
through, outside, injustafewmonths -and then this willbemyfull-
time job.”
“Hell, no.John!” hesaid, laughing, inanswer toaquestion— but
shecaught suddenly theparticular quality ofhisglance whenever it
rested onGalt: itwasthequality shehadseen inhiseyeswhen he
hadstood inherroom, clutching theedge ofatable tooutlive an
unlivable moment; hehadlooked asithewere seeing someone be-
fore him; itwas Galt, shethought; itwas Galt's image thathad
carried himthrough.
Some partofher feltadimdread: theeffort which Francisco had
made inthatmoment toaccept herlossand hisrival, asthepayment
demanded ofhim torhisbattle, hadcosthimsomuch thathewas
nowunable tosuspect thetruth Dr.Akslon hadguessed. What will
itdotohimwhen helearns?—shewondered, and feltabitter voice
reminding herthatthere would, perhaps, never beanytruth ofthis
kind tolearn.
Some partofher feltadimtension asshewatched thewayGall
looked atFrancisco: itwasanopen, simple, unreserved glance ot
surrender toanunreserved feeling. .She felttheanxious wonder she
hadnever fullynamed ordismissed? wonder whether this feeling
would bring himdown totheuglinesfc ofrenunciation.
Butmost ofhermindseemed swept bysomeenormous sense ot
release, asifshewere laughing atalbdoubts. Herglance kept going
back over thepath theyhadtraveled togethere, over thetwo ex-
hausting miles ofatwisted trailthat rfcn, likeaprecarious corkscrew,
from the tipofherfeetdown toth*floor ofthevalley. Her eyes
kept studying it,hermind racing withsome purpose ofitsown.
Brush, pinesandaclinging carpet dfmosswent climbing from the
726
green slopes farbelow, upthegranite ledges. Themoss andthe
brush vanished gradually, butthepines went on,struggling upward
inthinning strands, tillonlyafewdotsofsingle treeswere left,rising
upthenaked rocktoward thewhite sunbursts oisnow inthecrevices
atthepeaks. Shelooked atthespectacle ofthemost ingenious min-
ingmachinery shehadever seen, then atthe trailwhere theplodding
hoots andswaying shapes ofmules provided themost ancient form
oftransportation.
“Francisco,’' sheasked, pointing, “who designed themachines?”
“They're justadaptations ofstandard equipment.”
“Who designed them‘>”

“You're wasting anunconscionable amount ofmanpower and

Shewaslooking down anddidnotnotice thesudden, eager shot

“Nonsense! It’smuch simpler than itlooks. There’s apass tothe

Shewaspointing east, shedidnotnotice theintensity withwhich
thetwomenwere watching herface.
“Just anairow-gauge track isallyou’ll need . .like the first

expected them tobethere, asifshewere giving orders onaconstruc-

“Letmegiveyouarough ideaofwhat Imean. Ifwedrive diago-

Shestopped. When shelooked upattheir faces, the"firehadgone
outofhers.Shecrumpled hersketch andflung itaside intothered
dustofthegravel. “Oh, what for?” shecried, thedespair breaking
outforthe firsttime.‘Tobuild three miles ofrailroad andabandon
atranscontinental system!”
Thetwomenwere looking ather,shesawnoreproach intheir
faces, only alook ofunderstanding which wasalmost compassion.
“I’m sorry,” shesaid quietly, dropping hereyes.
“Ifyouchange your mind,” said Francisco, ‘Til hireyouonthe
spot—orMidas willgiveyoualoan infiveminutes tofinance that
railroad, ifyouwant toown ityourself.”
Sheshook herhead. “Ican't . ..”shewhispered, “not yet . ..”
She raised hereyes, knowing that theyknew thenature ofher
despair and that itwas useless tohide herstruggle. ‘Tve tried it
once,” shesaid. “I’ve tried togive itup... Iknow what itwill

Ifonly Icould stayhereandneverknow what they’re doing tothe
railroad, andnever learnwhen itgoes!”
“You’ll have tohearabout it,5”saidGalt; itwasthatruthless tone,
peculiarly his,which sounded implacable bybeing simple, devoid of
anyemotional value, save thequality ofrespect for facts. “You’ll
hear thewhole course ofthelastagony ofTaggart Transcontinental.
You’ll hearabout every wreck. You’ll hearabout every discontinued
train. You’ll hearabout every abandoned line. You’ll hearabout the
collapse oftheTaggart Bridge. Nobody stays inthisvalley excepi
byafull,conscious choice based onafull,conscious knowledge of
every factinvolved inhisdecision. Nobody stays herebyfaking
reality inanymanner whatever.”
Shelooked athim, herhead lifted, knowing what chance hewas
rejecting. Shethought thatnoman oftheouter world would have
said thistoher atthismoment—shethought oftheworld's code
thatworshipped white liesasanactofmercy—she feltastabofa
revulsion against thatcode, suddenly seeing itsfullugliness forthe
firsttime—she feltanenormous pride forthetight, clean faceofthe
manbefore her—hesawtheshape ofhermouth drawn firm inself-
control, yetsoftened bysome tremulous emotion, while sheanswered
quietly, “Thank you.You're right.”
“You don’t have toanswer menow,” hesaid. “You'll tellme
twhen you’ve decided. There’s stillaweek left.”
“Yes,” shesaidcalmly, “justonemore week.”
Heturned, picked uphercrumpled vsketch, folded itneatly and

“Dagny,” saidFrancisco, “when youieigh your decision, consider
the firsttimeyou quit, ifyouwish, butConsider everything about it.
Inthisvalley, youwon’t have totorture yourself byshingling roofs
andbuilding paths thatleadnowhere.’!
“Tell me,” sheasked suddenly, “how didyou findoutwhere I
was, thattime?” *
Hesmiled, “ItwasJohnwho toldme.Thedestroyer, remember?
728
Youwondered why thedestroyer hadnotsentanyone after you.
Buthehad. Itwashewho sentmethere.”
“He sentyou?”
“Yes.”
“What didhesaytoyou?”
“Nothing much.Why?”
“What didhesay?Doyouremember theexact words?”
“Yes, Idoremember. Hesaid,ifyouwant your chance, take it.
You’ve earned it.’ Iremember, because—”Heturned toGalt with
theuntroubled frown ofaslight, casual puzzle. “John, 1never quite

“Doyoumind if1don’t answer younow?”
“No, but—”
Someone hailed himfrom theledges ofthemine, andhewent off
swiftly, asifthesubject required nofurther attention.
Shewasconscious ofthelongspan ofmoments shetook while
turning herhead toGalt. Sheknew thatshewould findhimlooking
ather.Shecould read nothing inhiseyes, except ahintofderision,
asifheknew what answer shewasseeking andthatshewould not
find itinhisface.
“You gavehimachance thatyouwanted?”
“Icould havenochance tillhe'dhadevery chance possible to

“How didyouknow what hehadearned?”
“Ihadbeen questioning himabout you fortenyears, every time
1could,mevery way,from every angle. No,hedidnot tellme— it
svasthewayhespoke ofyouthat did.Hedidn't want tospeak, but
hespoke looeagerly, eagerly andreluctantly together—andthen I
knew that ithadnotbeen just achildhood friendship. Iknew'how
much hehadgiven uplorthestrike andhowdesperately hehoped
hehadn’t given itupforever. I?Iwasmerely questioning himabout
oneofourmost important future strikers— as1questioned himabout
many others.”
The hintofderision remained inhiseyes; heknew thatshehad
wanted tohear this,butthat thiswasnottheanswer totheone
question shefeared.
Shelooked from hisface toFrancisco’s approaching figure, not
hiding from herself anylonger thathersudden, heavy, desolate anxi-
etywasthefear thatGalt might throw' thethree ofthem intothe
hopeless waste ofself-sacrifice.
Francisco approached, looking atherthoughtfully, asifweighing
some question ofhisown, butsome question thatgave asparkle of
reckless gaiety tohiseyes.
“Dagny, there’s onlyoneweek left,” hesaid. “Ifyoudecide to
goback, itwillbethe last, foralongtime.” There wasnoreproach
andnosadness inhisvoice, onlysome softened quality assole evi*
dencc ofemotion. “Ifyou leavenow—ohyes, you’ll stillcome
back—but itwon’t besoon.And I—inafewmonths, I’llcome to
liveherepermanently, soifyougo, lwon’t seeyouagain, perhaps
foryears. I’dlikeyoutospend this lastweek withme. I’dlikeyou
729
tomove tomyhouse. Asmyguest, nothing else, fornoreason,
except that I'dlikeyou to."
Hesaid itsimply, asifnothing were orcould behidden among
thethree ofthem. Shesawnosignofastonishment inGalt’s face.
She feltsome swift tightening inherchest, something hard, reckless
andalmost vicious thathadthequality ofadark excitement driving
herblindly into action.
“But I'manemployee," shesaid, withanodd smile, looking at
Galt, “Ihave ajobtofinish."
“Iwon't holdyou toit,"said Galt, andshe feltanger atthe
tone oihisvoice, atone thatgranted hernohidden significance and
answered nothing butthe literal meaning ofherwords. “You can
quit thejobanytimeyouwish. It’suptoyou"
“No, itisn't. I’maprisoner here. Don’t youremember0I'mto
take orders. Ihavenopreferences tofollow, nowishes toexpress,
nodecisions tomake. Iwant thedecision tobeyours.”
“You want ittobemine?"
“Yes!”
“You’ve expressed awish."
Themockery ofhisvoice was initsseriousness—andshethrew at
him defiantly, notsmiling, asifdaring him tocontinue pretending
thathedidnotunderstand “All right That's what Iwish!"
Hesmiled, asatachild’s complex scheming which hehadlong
since seen through. “Very well." Buthedidnotsmile, ashesaid,
turning toFrancisco, “Then —no."
Thedefiance toward anadversary whowasthesternest otteach-
ers,was allthatFrancisco hadread inherface.Heshrugged, regret
fully, butgaily. “You're probably right. Ifyoucan’t prevent herIrorn
going back -nobody can."
Shewasnothearing Francisco's words. Shewasstunned hvthe
magnitude oftherelief that hitheratthesound ofGalt's answer, a
relief that toldherthemagnitude ofthefear itswept away. She
knew, only after itwasover, whathadhung forheronhisdecision,
sheknew thathadhisanswer been different, itwould have destroyed
thevalley inhereyes.
vShewanted tolaugh, shewanted toembrace them bothandlaugh
withthem incelebration, itdidnotseem tomatter whether she
would stayhere orreturn totheworld, aweek was likeanendless
span oftime, either course seemed flooded byanunchanging sun-
light—andnostruggle washard, shethought, ifthiswasthenature
ofexistence. The relief didnotcome from theknowledge that he
would notrenounce her,norfrom afiyassurance thatshewould
win—thereliefcame from thecertainty thathewould always remain
whathewas.
“Idon’tknow whether I’llgoback fotheworld ornot," shesaid
soberly, buthervoice wastrembling withsubdued violence, which
waspure gaiety. ‘Tip sorry thatI’m stjllunable tomake adecision.
Tmcertain ofonlyone thing: that Iwfan’t beafraid todecide."
Francisco took thesudden brightness ofherfaceasproof that the
incident hadbeen ofnosignificance. ButGaltunderstood; heglanced
730
atherandtheglance was partamusement, partcontemptuous
reproach.
Hesaidnothing, until theywere alone, walking down the trail to
thevalley. Then heglanced atheragain, theamusement sharper in
hiseyes, and said,“You hadtoputmetoatest inorder tolearn
whether I’dfalltothelowest possible stage ofaltruism?”
Shedidnotanswer, butlooked athim inopen, undefensive
admission.
Hechuckled andlooked away, andafewsteps later saidslowly,
inthetone ofaquotation. “Nobody stays herebyfaking reality in
anymanner whatever.'
Part oftheintensity ofher relief—shethought, asshewalked
silently byInsside—wastheshock ofacontrast: shehadseen, with
thesudden, immediate vividness ofsensory perception, anexact pic-
tureofwhat thecode ofself-sacrifice would havemeant, ifenacted

leached and unfulfilled -she, turning forconsolation toasecond

her will toself-deceit wastheessential required forGalt’s self-
sacrifice, then living outheiyears inhopeless longing, accepting, as

plusthetenet thatlove isfutile andhappiness isnottobefound on
earth -Francisco, struggling intheelusive togofacounterfeit reality,
hislifeafraud staged bythetwowhowere dearest tohimandmost
trusted, struggling tograsp what wasmissing from hishappiness,
struggling down the brittle scaffold ofalieover theabyss ofthe
discovery thathewasnottheman sheloved, butonly aresented

inghisdanger andonly hissurrender tolethargic stupidity protecting
theshoddy structure ofhisjoy,struggling andgiving upandsettling
intothedreary routine oftheconviction thatfulfillment isimpossible
toman—thethree ofthem,whohadhad allthe giftsofexistence
spread outbefore them, ending upasembittered hulks,who cryin
despair that life isfrustration—thefrustration ofnotbeing able to
make unreality real.
But ihis— -2,hethought—wasmen smoral code intheouter word,
acode that toldthem toactonthepremise ofoneanother’s weak-
ness. deceit andstupidity, and thiswasthepattern oftheir lives, this
struggle through afogofthepretended andunacknowledged, this
belief that facts arenotsolid orfinal, thisstate where, denying any
form toreality, menstumble through life,unreal andunformed, and
diehaving never been born. Here—shethought, looking down
through green branches attheglittering roofs ofthevalley—one
dealt withmen asclearandfirm assunandrocks, andtheimmense
light-heartedness ofherreliefcame from theknowledge thatnobat-
tlewashard, nodecision wasdangerous where there wasnosoggy
uncertainty, noshapeless evasion toencounter.
“Did iteveroccur toyou.MissTaggart,” saidGalt, inthecasual
731
tone ofanabstract discussion, butasifhehadknown 'herthoughts,
“that there isnoconflict ofinterests among men, neither inbusiness
nor intrade nor intheir most personal desires—iftheyomit the

hadmore respect forhimand formethan totearwhat youhad

Shedidnotanswer, she feltasifawordwould overfill thefullness
ofthismoment, shemerely turned tohimwith alook ofacquies-
cence thatwasdisarmed, childishly humble andwould havebeen an
apology butlor itsshining joy.
Hesmiled—inamusement, inunderstanding, almost incomrade-
shipofthethings theyshared and insanction ofthethings she felt.
They went oninsilence, and itseemed toherthat thiswas a
summer dayoutofacarefree youth shehadnever lived, itwas just
awalk through thecountry bytwopeople whowere free forthe
pleasure ofmotion and sunlight, withnounsolved burdens left to

The groceries, which Lawrence Hammond was lining upather
order onthepolished counter ofhisstore, hadnever appeared to
herassuch shining objects—and, intent upon them, shewasonly
half-conscious ofsome disturbing element, ofsomething thatwas
wrong butthathermind wastoo fulltonotice. Shenoticed itonly
when shesawHammond pause, frown andstare upward, atthesky
beyond hisopen store front.
Intimewith hiswords: “Ithink somebody’s trying torepeat your
stunt. MissTaggart,” sherealized that itwasthesound ofanairplane
overhead andthat ithadbeen there forsome time, asound which
wasnottobeheard inthevalley after the firstofthismonth.
They rushed outtothe street. The small silver cross ofaplane
wascircling above theringofmountains, likeasparkling dragonfly
about tobrush thepeaks with itswings.
‘What doeshethink he’sdoing?” saidLawrence Hammond.
There were people atthedoors oftheshops andstanding still all
down thestreet, looking up.
“Is... isanyone expected?” sheasked andwasastonished bythe
anxiety ofherown voice.
“No,” saidHammond. “Everyone who’s gotanybusiness here is
here.”Hedidnotsound disturbed, butgrimly curious.
Theplane wasnow asmall dash, likeasilver cigarette, streaking
against thetlanks ofthemountains: ithaddropped lower.
“Looks like aprivate monoplane.” saidHammond, squinting
against thesun.“Not anarmy model.”
“Will therayscreen holdout?” sheasked tensely, inatone of
defensive resentment against theapproach ofanenemy.
Hechuckled. “Hold out?”
“Will heseeus9”
“That screen issafer thananunderground vault. Miss Taggart. As
>ouought toknow.”
Theplane rose,andforamoment itwasonlyabright speck, like
abitofpaper blown bythewind—ithovered uncertainly, then
dropped down again intoanother circling spiral.
“Whatmhell isheafter?” saidHammond.
Hereyes shotsuddenly tohisface.
“He’s looking forsomething,” saidHammond. “What?”
“Isthere atelescope somewhere?”
“Why—yes, attheairfield, but—”Howasabout toaskwhatwas
thematter with hervoice- butshewasrunning across theroad,
down thepath tothe airfield, notknowing thatshewasrunning,
driven byareason shehadnotimeandnocourage toname.
Shefound Dwight Sanders atthesmall telescope ofthecontrol
tower; hewaswatching theplane attentively, with apuzzled frown.
“Letmesee it!”shesnapped.
Sheclutched themetal tube, shepressed hereyetothetens,her
hand guiding thetube slowly tofollow theplane—thenhesawthat
herhand hadstopped, butherfingers didnotopenandherface
remained bentoverthetelescope, pressed tothelens, untilhelooked
closer andsawthatthelenswaspressed toherforehead.
“What’s thematter. MissTaggart?”
733
Sheraised herhead slowly,
“Is itanyone youknow, MissTaggart?”
Shedidnotanswer. Shehurried away, hersteps rushing with the
zigzagging aimlessness ofuncertainty —shedared notrun, butshe
hadtoescape, shehad tohide, shedidnotknow whether shewas
afraid tobeseenbythemenaround herorbytheplane above—
theplane whose silver wings bore thenumber thatbelonged to
Hank Rearden.
Shestopped when shestumbled over arockand fellandnoticed
thatshehadbeen running. Shewasonasmall ledge inthe cliffs
above theairfield, hidden from thesight ofthetown, open tothe
view ofthesky.She rose, herhands groping forsupport along a
granite wall, feeling thewarmth ofthesunontherockunder her
palms—shestood, herback pressed tothewall, unable tomove or
totakehereyes offtheplane.
Theplane was circling slowly, dipping down, then rising again,
struggling—shethought—asshehad struggled, todistinguish the
sight ofawreck inahopeless spread ofcrevices andboulders, an
elusive spread neither clearenough toabandon nortosurvey. He
wassearching lorthewreck ofherplane, hehadnotgiven up,and
whatever thethree weeks of ithadcosthim,whatever hefelt,the
onlyevidence hewould give totheworld and hisonlyanswer was
thissteady, insistent, monotonous drone ofamotor carrying afragile
craft overevery deadly footofaninaccessible chain olmountains.
Through thebrilliant purity ofthesummer air,theplane seemed
intimately close, shecould see itrockonprecarious currents and
bank under thethrusts ofwind. Shecould see,and itseemed impossi-
blethatsoclear asightwasclosed tohiseyes.Thewhole ofthe
valley laybelow him, flooded bysunlight, flaming with glass panes
andgreen lawns, screaming tobeseen—theendofhistortured quest,
thefulfillment ofmore than hiswishes, notthewreck ofherplane
andherbody, butherliving presence and hisfreedom—allthathe
wasseeking orhadeversought wasnowspread open before him.
open andwaiting, histobereached byastraight-line divethrough
thepure, clear air—hisandasking nothing ofhimbutthecapacity
tosee.“Hank!” shescreamed, waving herarms indesperate sig-
nal.“Hank!”
She fellback against therock, knowing thatshehadnoway to
reach him, thatshehadnopower togivehim sight, thatnopower
onearth could pierce thatscreen except hisownmind and vision.
Suddenly andforthe firsttime, she feltthescreen, notasthemost
intangible, butasthemost grimly absolute barrier intheworld.
Slumped against therock, shewatched, insilent resignation, the
hopeless circles oftheplane’s struggle and itsmotor’s uncomplaining
cryforhelp, acryshehadnoway to^answer. Theplane swooped
down abruptly, but itwasonly thestart?ofitsfinal rise, itcutaswift
diagonal across themountains andshot intotheopen sky.Then, as
ifcaught inthespread ofalakewithnpshores andnoexit, itwent
sinking slowly anddrowning outofsigftt.
Shethought, inbitter compassion, ofhowmuch hehad failed to
see.And 1?—shethought. Ifshe leftthevalley, thescreen would
734
dose forherastightly, Atlantis would descend under avault ofrays
more impregnable than thebottom oftheocean, andshe,too,would
belefttostruggle forthethings shehadnotknown how tosee,she,
too,would belefttofight amirage ofprimordial savagery, while
thereality ofallthatshedesired would never come again within
herreach.
Butthepulloftheouter world, thepull thatdrew hertofollow
theplane, wasnottheimage ofHank Rcarden—sheknew thatshe
could notreturn tohim,even ifshereturned totheworld— thepull
wasthevision ofHank Rearden’s courage andthecourage ofall
those stillfighting tostay alive.Hewould notgiveupthesearch for
herplane, when allothers hadlong since despaired, ashewould not
giveuphismills, ashewould notgiveupanygoalhehadchosen
ifasingle chance was left.Wasshecertain thatnochance remained
fortheworld ofTaggart Transcontinental? Wasshecertain thatthe
terms ofthebattle were such thatshecould notcare towin?They
were right, themenofAtlantis, theywere right tovanish ifthey
knew thatthey leftnovalue behind them—butuntilandunless she
sawthatnochance wasuntaken andnobattle unfought, shehadno
riglu toremain among them. Thiswasthequestion thathadlashed
herforweeks, buthadnotdriven hertoaglimpse oftheanswer.
Shelayawake through thehours ofthat night, quietly motionless,
following—likeanengineer and likeHank Rcarden-—aprocess of

faintly visible inpatches ofstarlight, hutthehelp thosemenhad
called intheir darkest hourwasnothers tocall.

‘Yesorno,MissTaggart?”
Shelooked atthefaces ofthefourmen inthesoft twilight of
Mulligan's living room: Galt,whose facehadtheserene, impersonal
attentiveness ofascientist—Francisco, whose facewasmade expres-
sionless bythehintofasmile, thekind ofsmile thatwould fiteither
answer—Hugh Akston wholooked compassionately gentle—Midas
Mulligan, whohadasked thequestion withnotouch ofrancor in
hisvoice. Somewhere twothousand miles away, atthissunset hour,
thepage ofacalendar wasspringing into lightover theroofs ofNew
York, saying: June 28—and itseemed tohersuddenly thatshewas
seeing it,asifitwere hanging over theheads ofthese men.
“Ihaveonemore day,” shesaid steadily, “Will you letmehave
it?Ithink I’vereached mydecision, but famnotfully certain ofit
and I’llneed allthecertainty possible tome.”
“Ofcourse,” saidMulligan. “You have, infact, untilmorning of
thedayaftertomorrow. We’ll wait.”
“We’ll wait after thataswell,” saidHugh Akston, “though inyour
absence, ifthatbenecessary.”
Shestood bythewindow, facing them, andshe feltamoment’s
satisfaction intheknowledge thatshestood straight, thatherhands
didnottremble, thathervoicesounded ascontrolled, uncomplaining
735
andunpitying astheirs; itgave heramoment’s feeling ofabond
tothem.
“Ifanypartofyour uncertainty,” saidGalt, “isaconflict between
your heartandyourmind—follow yourmind.”
“Consider thereasons which make uscertain thatweareright,”
saidHugh Akston, “butnotthefactthatwearccertain. Ifyouare
notconvinced, ignore ourcertainty. Don’t betempted tosubstitute
ourjudgment foryourown.”
“Don’t relyonourknowledge ofwhat’s best foryour future,”
saidMulligan. “Wcdoknow, but itcan’tbebest untilyouknow it.”
“Don’t consider our interests ordesires,” said Francisco. “You
havenoduty toanyone butyourself.”
Shesmiled, neither sadly nor gaily, thinking thatnone of itwas
thesortofadvice shewould have been given intheouler world.
Andknowing how desperately theywished tohelp herwhere no
helpwaspossible, she felt itwasherpart togivethem reassurance.
“1forcedmyway here,” shesaid quietly, “and Iwas tobear
responsibility fortheconsequences. I’mbearing it.”
Herreward wastoseeGalt smile: thesmile was like amilitary
decoration bestowed upon her.
Looking away, sheremembered suddenly JeffAllen, thetramp
aboard theComet, inthemoment when shehadadmired him for
attempting totellherthatheknew where hewasgoing, tospare
hertheburden ofhisaimlessness. Shesmiled faintly, thinking that
shehadnowexperienced itinboth roles andknew thatnoaction
could belower ormore futile than foroneperson tothrow upon
another theburden ofhisabdication ofchoice. She feltanoddcalm,
almost aconfident repose, sheknew that itwas tension, butthe
tension ofagreat clarity. Shecaught herself thinking; She’s function-
ingwell inanemergency. I'llbeallright withher—andrealized that
shewasthinking ofherself.
“Let itgotilldayaftertomorrow. MissTaggart,” saidMidas Mulli-
gan.“Tonight you’re stillhere.”
“Thank you,” shesaid.
Sheremained bythewindow, while theywentondiscussing the
valley’s business; itwastheir closing conference ofthemonth. They
had justfinished dinner—andshethought ofher firstdinner inthis
house amonth ago;shewaswearing, asshehadthenworn, thegray
suitthatbelonged inheroffice, notthepeasant skirt thathadbeen
soeasy towear inthesun.I’m stillhere tonight, shethought, hei
hand pressed possessively tothewindow sill.
Thesunhadnotyetvanished beyond themountains, butthesky
wasaneven, deep, deceptively clear blue thatblended with theblue
ofinvisible clouds intoasingle spread, hiding thesun;only theedges
oftheclouds were outlined byathinthread offlame, and itlooked
likeaglowing, twisted netofneon tubing, shethought . ..likea
chart ofwinding rivers ...like ..,like!themapofarailroad traced
inwhite fireonthesky.
Sheheard Mulligan giving Galt theflames ofthosewhowere not
returning totheouter world.“Wehave jobs for allofthem,” said
Mulligan. “In fact, there’s only tenortwelve menwho’re going back
736
thisyear— mostly tofinish off,convert whatever theyownandcome
herepermanently. Ithink thiswasour lastvacation month, because
before another year isoverwell allbeliving inthisvalley/'
“Good/* said Galt,
“Well have to,from theway things aregoing outside/’
“Yes.”
“Francisco,” saidMulligan, “you’ll come back inafewmonths?”
“InNovember atthelatest/’ said Francisco. “I’llsendyouword
byshort wave, when I’mready tocome back—willyou turn the
furnace oninmyhouse?”
“Iwill,” saidHugh Akston. “And I’llhaveyoursupper ready for
youwhen youarrive.”
“John, Itake itforgranted,” saidMulligan, “that you’re notre-
turning toNewYork thistime.”
Galt took amoment toglance athim, thenanswered evenly, “I
have notdecided ityet.”
Shenoticed theshocked swiftness withwhich Francisco andMulli-
ganbentforward tostare athim—andtheslowness withwhichHugh
Akston’s glance moved tohisface; Akston didnotseem tohe
astonished.
“You’re notthinking ofgoing back tothat hellforanother year,
areyou?” saidMulligan.
“1am.”
“But—goodGod, John!—what for?”
“I’ll tellyou,when I’vedecided.”
“But there’s nothing leftthere foryoutodo.Wegoteverybody
weknew oforcanhope toknow ot.Our list iscompleted, except
forHank Rearden— and we’ll gethimbefore theyear isover—and
MissTaggart, ifshesochooses That’s allYour job isdone. There’s
nothing tolook for,outthere—except thefinal crash, when theroof
comes down ontheir heads.”
“Iknow it.”
“John, yours istheonehead Idon’t want tobethere w'hen it
happens.”
“You’ve never hadtoworry about me.”
“But don’t yourealize what stage they’re coming to?They’re only
onestepaway fromopen violence—hell,they’ve taken thestepand
sealed anddeclared itlong ago!—butinonemoremoment they'll
seethe fullreality ofwhat they’ve taken, exploding intheirdamned
faces— plain, open, blind, arbitrary, bloodshedding violence, running
amuck, hitting anything andanyone atrandom. That’s what Idon’t
want toseeyou inthemidst of.”
“Icantakecareofmyself,”
“John, there’s noreason foryoutotaketherisk,” saidFrancisco.
“What risk?”
“The looters areworried about themenwho’ve disappeared.
They’re suspecting something. You, ofallpeople* shouldn’t stay
there anylonger. There’s always achance thattheymight discover
justwhoandwhatyouare.”
'There’s some chance. Notmuch.”
737
“But there’s noreason whatever totake it.There's nothing left
thatRagnar and Ican’t finish.”
Hugh Akston waswatching them silently, leaning hack inhischair;
hisfacehadthatlook ofintensity, neither quite bitterness norquite
asmile, withwhich amanwatches aprogression that interests him,
butthat lags afewsteps behind hisvision,
“If Igoback,” said Galt, “itwon’t beforouiwork. Itwillbeto
wintheonly thing Iwant lrom theworld formyself, now that the
work isdone. I’vetaken nothing from theworld and I'vewanted
nothing. Butthere’s onething which it’s stillholding andwhich is
mineandwhich Iwon’t let ithave. No, 1don’t intend tobreakmy
oath, Iwon’t dealwith thelooters, 1won’t beofanyvalue orhelp
toanyone outthere, neither tolooters norneutrals— norscabs. If I
go. itwon’t beforanyone’s sake butmine—and Idon’t think I'm
risking my life,but iflam—well. I’mnow Iree torisk it.”
Hewasnotlooking ather,butshehad toturnaway andstand
pressed against thewindow frame, because herhands were trem-
bling.
“But, John!” cried Mulligan, waving hisarm atthevalley, “if
anything happens toyou,whatwouldwe—” Hestopped abruptly
and guiltily.
Galt chuckled. “What were youabout tosay?” Mulligan waved
hishand sheepishly, inagesture ofdismissal. “Wcie youabout to
saythat ifanything happens tome. I’lldieastheworst failurem
theworld?”
“All right," saidMulligan guiltily, “Iwon't say it. Iwon't saythat
wecouldn’t getalong without you—wecan Iwon’t begyoutostay
here foroursake—Ididn't think I'dever revert tothat rotten old
plea, but,boy!— what atemptation itwas, Icanalmost seewhy
people do it. 1know thatwhatever itisyouwant, ityouwish torisk
your life, that’s allthere istoit—butI’mthinking only that it's
ohGod, John, it’ssuch avaluable life!”
Galt smiled. “1know itThat’s why 1don’t think I'mrisking it--
1think I’llwin.”
Francisco wasnow silent, hewaswatching Galt intently, with a
frown ofwonder, notasifhehadfound ananswer, butas iihehad
suddenly glimpsed aquestion
“Look, John,” saidMulligan, “since youhaven’t decided whether
you’ll go—youhaven’t decided ityet,haveyou?”
“No, notyet.”
“Since youhaven’t, would you letmeremind youofafewthings,
justforyoutoconsider?”
“Goahead.”
“It's thechance dangers thatI’mafraid of—the senseless, unpre-
dictable dangers ofaworld falling apart. Consider thephysical risks
ofcomplex machinery inthehands ofblind fools andfear-crazed
cowards. Justthink oftheir railreads-fyou’d betaking achance on
some such horror asthatWinston tifrmel incident every timeyou
stepped aboard atrain—and there willbemore incidents ofthat
kind,coming faster and faster, lliey ’llreach thestagewhere noday
willpasswithout amajor wreck.”
738
“iknow it.”
“And thesame willbehappening inevery other industry* wher-
evermachines areused— themachines which they thought could
replace ourminds. Plane crashes, oiltank explosions, blast-furnace
break-outs, high-tension wire electrocutions, subway cave-ins and
trestle collapses—they’ll seethem all.Theverymachines thathad
made their lifesosafe, willnowmake itacontinuous peril.”
“Jknow it.”
“Iknow thatyouknow it,buthaveyouconsidered itinevery
specific detail? Have youallowed yourself tovisualize it7Iwantyou
tosectheexact picture ofwhat itisthatyoupropose toenter—
before youdecide whether anything canjustify your entering it.You
know that thecities willbehitworst otall.The cities weremade
bytherailroads and willgowiththem.”
“That’s right.”
“When the railsarecut,thecityofNew'York willstarve intwo
days. That’s allthesupply offood it'sgot. It'sfedbyacontinent
three thousand miles long.How willthey carry food toNewYork?
Bydirective andoxcart? Hut first, before ithappens, they’ll go
through thewhole oftheagony -through theshrinking, theshort-
ages, thehunger riots, thestampeding violence inthemidst ofthe
growing stillness.”
‘They will.”
“They'll lose their airplanes first,then their automobiles, then their
trucks, then their horsecarts.”
“They will.”
“Their factories will stop, then their furnaces and their radios.
Then their electric lightsystem willgo."
“It will.'’
“There’s only aworn thread holding that continent together.
Ihere willbeonetram aday, thenone train aweek—then the
Taggart Bridge willcollapse and—”
“No, itwon’t!”
Itwashervoice andtheywhirled toher.Herfacewaswhite, but
calmer than ithadbeenwhen shehadanswered them last.
Slowly, Galt rose tohisfeetandinclined hishead, asinacceptance
ofaverdict. “You ha\emade your decision,” hesaid.
“Ihave.”
“Dagny,” saidHugh Akston, “I'm sorry.” Hespoke softly, with
eflort, asifhiswords were struggling and failing tofillthesilence
oftheroom. “1wish itwere possible nottoseethishappen, Iwould
have preferred anything—except toseeyoustayherebydefault of
thecourage ofyour convictions.”
Shespread herhands, paims out,herarms athersides, inagesture
otsimple frankness, and said, addressing them all,hermanner so
calm thatshecould afford toshow emotion, “Iwantyoutoknow
this: 1havewished itwere possible formetodieinonemore month,
sothat 1could spend itinthisvalley. This ishowmuch I’vewanted
toremain. Butsolong as 1choose togoonliving, Ican’t desert a
battle which Ithink ismine tofight,”
“Ofcourse,” saidMulligan respectfully, “ifyou stillthink it.”
739
“Ifyouwant toknow theonereason that’s taking mehack, I'll

greatness oftheworld, allthatwhich wasmine andyours, which

their minds. Solong asmen desire tolive, 1cannot losemybattle/'
“Do they?'’ saidHugh Akston softly.“Do they desire it?No.
don’t answer menow. Iknow thattheanswer wasthehardest thing
foranyofustograsp and toaccept. Justtake thatquestion back
with you. asthe lastpremise lefttoryoutocheck.”
“You’re leaving asourfriend,” saidMidas Mulligan, “and well
befighting everything you’ll do,because weknow you’re wrong, bul
it’snotyouthat we’ll bedamning.”
“You'll come back.” saidHugh Akston, "because yours isanerror
ofknowledge, notamoral failure, notanactolsurrender toevil,
butonly the lastactofbeing victim toyourown virtue. We’ll wait
foryou—and,Dagny, when youcome back, you willhave discovered
thatthere need never beany conflict among your desires, norso
tragic aclash ofvalues astheoneyou’ve borne sowell”
“Thank you,” shesaid, closing hereyes.
“Wemust discuss theconditions otyour departure,” saidGalt; he
spoke inthedispassionate manner ofanexecutive “First, youmust
give usyourword thatyou willnotdisclose oursecret oranypart
of it—neither ourcause norourexistence not thisvalley noryour
whereabouts forthepastmonth- -toanyone intheouter world, not
atanytimeorforanypurpose whatsoever.”
“Igiveyoumyword.”
“Second, youmust never attempt tofind thisvalley again. You
arenottocome here uninvited. Should youbreak the firstcondition,
itwillnotplace usinserious danger. Should youbreak thesecond—
itwill. Itisnotourpolicy ever tobeatthearbitrary mercy ofthe
good faith ofanother person, oratthemercy ofapromise that
cannot beenforced. Norcanweexpect you toplace ourinterests
above yourown. Since youbelieve thatyour course isright, theday
maycornewhen youmay find itnecessary toleadourenemies to
this valley.We shall, therefore, leave younomeans todo it.You
willbetaken outofthevalley byplane, blindfolded, andyou will
beflown adistance sufficient tomake itimpossible foryouever to
retrace thecourse.”
Sheinclined herhead.“You areright.”
“Your plane hasbeen repaired. Doyouwish toreclaim itby
signing adraftonyour account attheMulligan Bank?”
“No.”
“Then weshall hold it,until suchtime asyouchoose topaylor
it.Day aftertomorrow, IwilltakeyouInmyplane toapoint outside
thevalley andleave youwithin reach foffurther transportation.”
Sheinclined herhead. “Very well.”"
Ithadgrown dark,when they leftMidas Mulligan’s. The trailback
toGalt’s house ledacross thevalley, pastFrancisco’s cabin, andthe
740
three ofthemwalked home together, Afewsquares oflighted win-
dowshung scattered through thedarkness, andthe firststreams of
mistwere weaving slowly across thepanes, likeshadows castbya
distant sea.They walked insilence, butthesound oftheir steps,
blending intoasingle, steady beat,was likeaspeech tobegrasped
andnottobeuttered inanyother form.
After awhile, Francisco said, “Itchanges nothing, itonlymakes
thespan alittle longer, andthelaststretch isalways thehardest—
but it’sthelast.”
“Iwillhope so,”shesaid. Inamoment, sherepeated quietly, “The
last isthehardest.” Sheturned toGalt.“May Imake onerequest?”
“Yes.”
“Will you letmegotomorrow?”
“Ifyouwish.”
When Francisco spoke again, moments later, itwasasifhewere
addressing theunnamed wonder inhermind; hisvoice hadthetone
ofanswering aquestion: “Dagny, allthree ofusareinlove’"—she
jerked herhead tohim—“with thesame thing, nomatter what its
forms. Don't wonder whyyou feelnobreach among us.You’ll be
oneofus,solong asyou’ll remain inlove withyour railsandyour
engines—and they’ll leadyouback tous,nomatter howmany times
youloseyour way.Theonlymannever toberedeemed istheman
without passion.”
“Thank you.” shesaid softly.
“Forwhat?”
“For ...forthewayyousound.”
“Mow do Isound? Name it,Dagny.”
“You sound ...asifyou're happy.”
“1am— inexactly thesamewayyou arc.Don’t tellmewhatyou
teel. Iknow it.But,you see,themeasure ofthehellyou’re able to
endure isthemeasure olyour love.The hell 1couldn’t bear to
witness would betoseeyoubeing indifferent.”
Shenodded silently, unable toname asjoyanypartofthethings
she felt,yetfeeling thathewas right.
Clots ofmistwere drifting, likesmoke, across themoon, and in
thediffused glow shecould notdistinguish theexpressions oftheir
faces, asshewalked between them: theonlyexpressions toperceive
were thestraight silhouettes oftheir bodies, theunbroken sound of
their steps andherown feeling thatshewished towalkonand
on,afeeling shecould notdefine, except that itwasneither doubt
noipain.
When theyapproached hiscabin, Francisco stopped, thegesture
ofhishand embracing them both ashepointed tohisdoor. “Will
youcome in—since it’stobeour lastnight together forsome time?
Let’shave adrink tothefuture ofwhich allthree ofusarecertain.”
“Arewe?” sheasked.
“Yes,” said Gall,“we are.”
Shelooked attheir faceswhen Francisco switched onthelight in
hishouse. Shecould notdefine their expressions, itwasnothappi-
nessoranyemotion pertaining tojoy, their faces were tautand
solemn, but itwasaglowing solemnity—shethought—ifthiswere
741
possible, andtheoddglow she feltwithin her,toldherthatherown
facehadthesame look.
Francisco reached forthree glasses from acupboard, butslopped,
asatasudden thought. Heplaced one glassonthetable, then
reached forthetwosilver goblets ofSebastian d’Anconia andplaced
them beside it.
“Are yougoing straight toNewYork, Dagny?" heasked, inthe
calm, unstrained tone ofahost, bringing outabottle ofoldwine.
“Yes," sheanswered ascalmly.
“I’m flying toBuenos Aires day after tomorrow," hesaid, un-
corking thebottle. “I’m notsurewhether 111beback inNewYork
later, but ifIam, itwillbedangerous foryoutoseeme."
“Iwon’t careabout that," .shesaid, “unless you feel thatI’mnot
entitled toseeyouanylonger."
“True, Dagny. You're not.Not inNewYork"
Hewaspouring thewineandheglanced upatGalt. “John, when
willyoudecide whether you’re going back orstaying here7”
Galt looked straight athim. then said slowly, inthetone ofa
manwhoknows alltheconsequences ofhiswords, “Ihave decided,
Francisco. I’mgoing back."
Francisco’s hand stopped. Foralongmoment, hewasseeing noth-
ing,butGalt’s face. Then hiseyesmoved tohers.Heputthebottle
down andhedidnotstepback, bin itwasas ilhisglance drew back
toawider range, toinclude them both.
“But ofcourse," hesaid.
Helooked as ilhohadmoved stillfarther andwerenow seeing
thewhole spread oftheir years: hisvoice hadaneven, uninflected
sound, aquality thatmatched thesi/e olthevision.
“Iknew ittwelve years ago," hesaid.‘1knew itbefore youcould
haveknown, and it’s Iwhoshould have seen thatyouwould see
That night, when youcalled ustoNew York, Ithought of itthen

too. Itcould nothavebeen otherwise. Itisas ithad andought-
tobe. Itwas setthen, twelve years ago."Helooked atGalt and
chuckled softly. “And yousaythat it’s /who’ve taken thehaidest
beating?"
Heturned with tooswift amovement -then, tooslowly, as itin
deliberate emphasis, hecompleted thetask olpouring thewine, till-
ingthethree vessels onthetable.Hepicked upthetwo silver gob-
lets,looked down atthem forthepause ofaninstant, thenextended
one toDagny, theother toGalt.
“fake it,"hesaid.“You’ve earned it—and itwasn’t chance."
Galttook thegoblet from hishand, t>ut itwasas iftheacceptance
wasdone bytheir eyes asthey lookecj ateach other.
“Iwould have given anything tolei itbeotherwise." said Galt,
“except thatwhich isbeyond giving.";
Sheheldhergoblet, shelooked atfrancisco andshe lethim, see
hereyes glance atGalt. “Yes," shesaidmthetone ofananswer
“But Ihave notearned it—andwhat you’ve paid, I’mpaying itnow.
742
and Idon’tknow whether HIeverearnenough toholddear title,
but ifhell istheprice—andthemeasure—then letmebethegreedi-
estofthethree ofus/’
Asthey drank, asshestood, hereyesdosed, feeling theliquid
motion ofthewine inside herthroat, sheknew thatlor allthree of
them thiswasthemost tortured—andthemost exultant—moment
theyhadever reached.
Shedidnotspeak toGalt, astheywalked down the laststretch
ofthe trail tohishouse. Shedidnotturnherhead tohim, feeling
thateven aglance would betoodangerous. She felt, intheir silence,
both thecalm ofatotalunderstanding andthetension oftheknowl-
edge thattheywere nottoname thethings theyunderstood.
Butshefaced him,when theywere inhisliving room, with full
confidence andasifinsudden certainty ofaright—thecertainty that
shewould notbreak and that itwasnow safe tospeak. Shesaid
evenly, neither aspleanorastriumph, merely asthestatement ofa
fact,“You aregoing back totheouter world because 1willbethere.”
“Yes.”
“Idonotwant youtogo.”
“You havenochoice about it.”
“You aregoing formysake.”
“No, formine.”
“Will youallowmetoseeyouthere?”
‘No.”
“Iamnottosecyou7”
“No.”
“1amnottoknow where youareorwhatyoudo?"
“You’re not”
“Will youbewatching me,asyoudidbefore^”
“More so.”
“Isvourpuipose toprotect me?”
“No”
“What isit,then?”
“Tobethere onthedaywhen youdecide tojoin us,”
Shelooked athimattentively, permitting herself noother reaction,
butasifgroping torananswer tothe firstpoint shehadnotfully
understood.
“All therestofuswillbegone,” heexplained. “Itwillbecome
toodangerous toremain. Iwillremain asyour lastkey,before the
door ofthisvalley closes altogether.”
“Oh!” Shechoked itoffbefore itbecame amoan. Then, regaining
themanner ofimpersonal detachment, sheasked, “Suppose Iwere
totellyouthatmydecision isfinalandthat Iamnever tojoinyou?”
“Itwould bealie.”
“Suppose 1werenow todecide that Iwish tomake itfinaland
tostand by it,nomatter what thefuture?”
“Nomatter whal future evidence youobserve andwhat convic-
tionsyouform?”
“Yes.”
“That would beworse than aHe,”
“You arecertain that Ihavemade thewrong decision?”
743
“Iam.”
“Doyou believe thatonemust beresponsible forone’sown
errors?”
“1do.”
“Then why aren’t youlettingmebear theconsequences ofmine?”
“Iamandyou will.”
“If Ifind,when itistoolate, that 1want toreturn tothisvalley--
whyshould youhave tobear the risk ofkeeping thatdooropen
tome?”
“Idon't have to. Iwouldn’t do itifIhadnoselfish endtogain.”
“What selfish end?”
“1wantyouhere.”
Sheclosed hereyesandinclined herhead inopen admission of
defeat—defeat intheargument and inherattempt tofacecalmly
the fullmeaning ofthatwhich shewasleaving.
Then sheraised herhead and, asifshehadabsorbed hiskind of
frankness, shelooked athim, hiding neither hersuffering norher
longing norhercalm, knowing that allthree were inherglance.
Hisfacewasasithadbeen inthesunlight ofthemoment when
shehadseen itforthe first time- alace ofmerciless serenity and
unflinching perceptiveness, without painorfearorguilt.Shethought
thatwere itpossible forhertostand looking athim, atthestraight
lines ofhiseyebrows over thedark green eyes, atthecurve olthe
shadow underscoring theshape ofhismouth, atthepoured-meial
planes ofhisskin intheopen collar ofhisshirtandthecasually
immovable posture ofhislegs—shewould wish tospend therest ol
her lifeonthisspotand inthismanner. And inthenext instant she
knew that ifherwishwere granted, thecontemplation would lose
allmeaning, because shewould have betrayed allthethings that
gave itvalue.
Then, notasmemory, butasanexperience ofthepresent, she lelt
herself reliving themoment when shehadstood atthewindow ot
herroom inNewYork, looking atafogbound city, attheunattain-
ableshape ofAtlantis sinking outofreach— andsheknew thatshe
wasnowseeing theanswer tothatmoment She felt,notthewords
shehadthen addressed tothecity, butthatuntranslated sensation
from which thewords hadcome: You,whom 1have always loved
andnever found, youwhom Iexpected toseeattheendofthe rails
beyond thehorizon—
Aloud, shesaid, “Iwantyoutoknow this. Istarted my lifewith
asingle absolute: thattheworld wasmine toshape intheimage ot
myhighest values andnever tobegiven uptoalesser standard, no
matter howlong orhard thestruggle”—youwhose presence lhad

Hehadstood without moving, hehadlistened withnochange in
hisface, only hiseyeshadlooked atherasifhewere hearing every
word, even thewords shehadnotpronounced. Heanswered, with
thesame look, asifthelookwere holding some circuit notyetto
bebroken, hisvoice catching some tone ofhers, asifinsignal of
thesame code, avoice withnosignofemotion except inthespacing
ofthewords:
“Ifyou fail, asmenhave failed intheir quest foravision that

Then, turning hishead alittle, hisvoice asclear, buthiseyes
breaking the circuit, heasked, “What timedoyouwish toleave

“Oh ...!Asearly asitwillbeconvenient foryou.”
“Then have breakfast ready atseven andwe’ll take offateight.”
“1will.”

“The lastofyourwages forthemonth,” hesaid.
Her fingers snapped dosed over thecointootightly, hutshean-

“Good night, Miss Taggart.”
“Good night.”

peasant skirt, ablouse, anapron, afewpieces ofunderwear—folded
neatly inadrawer ofthechest inherroom. Shelooked atthem for

Shedidnotknow when thewheels lefttheground orwhen the

They didnotspeak. Once, shesaidsuddenly, “Mr. Galt.”
“Yes?”
“No. Nothing, 1justwanted loknovy whether youwere stillthere”
“Iwillalways bethere.”’
Shedidnotknow forhowmany rdiles thememory ofthesound

Shedidnotknow whether adayh^dpassed oranhour, whert she

She feltthe joltofthewheels against theground asanoddly

She felttherunning streak ofjerky motion, then thejarofthe

Chapter 111ANTI-GREED
"Whatam 1doing here?” asked Dr.Robert Stadler. “Why was l
asked tocome here? Idemand anexplanation. I'mm»iaccustomed
t0being dragged halfway across acontinent without rhyme, reason
°rnotice.”
747
Dr.Floyd Ferris smiled. “Which makes meappreciate itallthe
more thatyoudidcome, Dr.Stadler.” Itwasimpossible totell
whether hisvoice hadatone ofgratitude—orofgloating.
Thesunwasbeating down uponthemandDr.Stadler feltastreak
ofperspiration oozing along histemple. Hecould notholdanangrily,
embarrassingly private discussion inthemiddle ofacrowd streaming
to fillthebenches ofthegrandstand around them—thediscussion
which hehad triedand failed toobtain forthe lastthree days. It
occurred tohim that thatwasprecisely thereason why hismeeting
with Dr.Ferris hadbeen delayed tothismoment; buthebrushed
thethought aside, just ashebrushed some insect buzzing toreach
hiswettemple.
“Why was 1unable togetintouch with you?’' heasked. Thefraudu-
lentweapon ofsarcasm nowseemed tosound lesseffective than ever,
but itwasDr.Stadler’s onlyweapon: “Why didyoufind itnecessary
tosendmemessages onofficial stationery worded inastyle proper,
Fmsure, forArmy'1—orders, hewasabout tosay,butdidn’t—“com-
munications. butcertainly notforscientific correspondence?1’
“It isagovernment matter,” saidDr.Ferns gently.
“Doyourealize that Iwasmuch toobusyandthat thismeant an
interruption ofmywork?”
“Oh yes,” saidDr.Ferris noncommittally.
“Doyou realize that Icould have refused tocome?”
“Butyoudidn’t,” saidDr.Ferris softly.
“Why was Igiven noexplanation? Why didn't youcome forme in
person, instead ofsending those incredible young hooligans with their
mysterious gibberish thatsounded hall-science, half-pulp-magazine?"
“Iwastoobusy,” saidDr.Ferns blandly.
“Then would youmind tellingmewhat you’re doing inthemiddle
ofaplain inIowa—andwhat I’mdoing here, forthatmatter?” He
waved contemptuously atthedusty horizon ofanempty prairie and
atthethree wooden grandstands. The stands were newly erected,
andthewood, too,seemed toperspire; hecould seedrops ofresin
sparkling inthesun.
“We areabout towitness anhistorical event. Dr.Stadler. An
occasion which willbecome amilestone ontheroadofscience, civil]
zation, social welfare and political adaptability.” Dr. Ferris’ voice
hadthetone ofapublic relations man’s memorized handout. “The
turning point ofanew era.”
“What event? Whatnewera?”
“Asyou willobserve, only themost distinguished citizens, the
cream ofourintellectual elite, havebeenchosen forthespecial privi-
legeofwitnessing thisoccasion. Wecpuld notomityourname, could
we?—andwefeel certain, ofcoursfe, thatwecancount onyour
loyalty andcooperation.”
f
Hecould notcatch Dr.Ferris’ eyefThegrandstands were rapidly
filling with people, andDr.Ferris jkept interrupting himself con-
stantly towave tonondescript newcomers, whom Dr.Stadler had
never seen before, butwhowere personages, ashecould tellbythe
particular shade ofgaily informal deference inFerris' waving. They
748
allseemed toknow Dr.Ferris andtoseekhimout, asifhewere
themaster ofceremonies —orthestar—oftheoccasion.
“Ifyouwould kindly bespecific foramoment,' ”saidDr.Stadler,
“and tellmewhat—”
“Hi,Spud!” called Dr. Ferris, waving toaportly, white-haired
manwho filled thefull-dress uniform ofageneral.
Dr.Stadler raised hisvoice: “Isaid, ifyouwould kindly concen-
trate longenough toexplain tomewhat inhell isgoing on—"
“But it’sveiy simple. It’sthe finaltriumph of . .You’ll have to
excuse meaminute. Dr.Stadler/' said Dr.Ferris hastily, tearing
forward, likeanovertrained lackey atthesound ofabell, inthe
direction ofwhat looked likeagroup ofaging rowdies; heturned
hack longenough toaddtwowords which heseemed reverently to
consider asafullexplanation: “The press!”
Dr.Stadler satdown onthewooden bench, feeling unaccountably
reluctant tobrush against anything around him.The three grand-
stands were spaced atintervals masemi-curve, likethetiers ofa
small, private circus, withroom forsome three hundred people; they
seemed built lortheviewing ofsome spectacle—butthey faced the
emptiness ofafiatprairie stretching offtothehorizon, withnothing
msight butthedark blotch ofatarmhouse miles awa>
There were radio microphones infront ofonestand, which seemed
icscrvcd forthepress. Iherewasacontraption resembling aportable
switchboard infront ofthestand reserved furofficials; afewlevers
onpolished metal sparkled inthesunonthefaceoftheswitchboaid.
Inanimprovised parking lotbehind thestands, theglitter ofluxuri-
ousnewcarsseemed abiightly reassuring sight. But itwasthebuild-
ingthatstood onaknollsome thousand feetaway thatgave Dr.
Stadler avague sense ofuneasiness. Itwasasmall, squat structure
ofunknown purpose, with massive stone walls, nowindows except
afew slitsprotected bystout iron bars,andalargedome, grotesquely
tooheavy lortherest, thatseemed topress thestructure down into
the soil.Afewoutlets protruded from thebase ofthedome, in
loose, irregular shapes, resembling badly poured clay funnels; they
didnotseem tobelong toanindustrial ageortoanyknown usage
Thebuilding hadanairofsilent malevolence, likeapuffed, venom-
ousmushroom; itwasobviously modern, but itssloppy, rounded,
ineptly unspecific linesmade itlook like aprimitive structure un-
earthed intheheart ofthejungle, devoted tosome secret rites of
savagery.
Dr.Stadler sighed with irritation; hewas tired ofsecrets. “Confi-
dential" and“'Fop Confidential" hadbeen thewords stamped on
theinvitation which haddemanded thathetravel toIowaonatwo-
daynotice and foranunspecified purpose. Twoyoung men.who
called themselves physicists, hadappeared attheInstitute toescort
hint; hiscalls toFerris’ office inWashington hadremained unan-
swered. Theyoung menhadtalked- -through anexhausting tripby
government plane, then aclammy ride inagovernment car—about
science, emergencies, social equilibriums andtheneed ofsecrecy, till
heknew lessthanhehadknown atthestart; henoticed only that
twowords kept recut ring intheir jabber, which hadalsoappeared
749
inthetextoftheinvitation, twowords thathadanominous sounc
when involving anunknown issue: thedemands f6rhis‘‘loyalty’
and"cooperation.”
Theyoung menhaddeposited himonabench inthefront rou
ofthegrandstand andhadvanished, likethefolding gearofamecha
nism, leaving hint tothesudden presence ofDr,Ferris inperson
Now, watching thescene around him, watching Dr. Ferris’ vague
excited, loosely casual gestures inthemidst ofagroup ofnewsmen
hehadanimpression ofbewildering confusion, ofsenseless, chaotic
inefficiency—andofasmooth machine working toproduce theexaci
degree ofthatimpression needed attheexactmoment.
He feltasingle, sudden flash ofpanic, inwhich, asinaflash ol
lightning, hepermitted himself toknow thathefeltadespeiale de-
siretoescape. Butheslammed hismind shut against it.Heknew
thatthedarkest secret oftheoccasion—more crucial, more untouch
able,more deadly thanwhatever washidden inthemushroom build
ing—wasthatwhich hadmade himagree tocome.
Hewould never have tolearn hisown motive, hethought; he
thought it,notbymeans ofwoids, butbymeans ofthebrief, viciou;'
spasm ofanemotion thatresembled irritation and feltlikeacid.The
words thatstood inhismind, astheyhadstoodwhen hehadagreed
tocome were like avoodoo formula which one recites when itn
needed andbeyond which onemust notlook:What ranyoudowhen
youhave todeal withpeople?
Henoticed that thestand reserved forthosewhom Ferris hae
called theintellectual elitewas larger than thestand prepared foi
government officials. Hecaught himself feeling aswift little sneai
ofpleasure atthethought thathehadbeen placed intheIron
row.Heturned toglance atthetiersbehind him.Thesensation he
experienced was likeasmall, gray shock: thatrandom, faded, shop
worn assembly wasnot hisconception ofanintellectual elite. Hi
sawdefensively belligerent menand tastelessly dressed women—hi
sawmean, rancorous, suspicious faces thatbore theonemark incam
patible with astandard bearer oftheintellect: themark ofuncer
tainty. Hecould findnofaceheknew, nofacetorecognize asfamou!
andnone likely ever toachieve such recognition. Hewondered b>
what standard these people hadbeen selected.
Then henoticed agangling figure inthesecond row, thefigure o
anelderly man with along, stack face thatseemed faintly familial
tohim,though hecould recall nothing about it,except avaguemem
ory, asofaphotograph seen insome unsavory publication. Hi
leaned toward awoman andasked, pointing, "Could you tellme ihi
name ofthatgentleman?” Thewon^an answered inawhisper o
awed respect, "That isDr.Simon ^ritchett!” Dr.Stadler turnci
away, wishing noonewould see hiifi, wishing noonewould evci
learn thathehadbeen amember ofjthat group.
Heraised hiseyesandsawthatFeiyis wasleading thewhole pres?
gang toward him.Hesaw Ferris sweeping hisarm athim, inthi
manner ofatourist guide, and declaring, when theywere dost
enough tobeheard, "Butwhyshould youwaste your timeonme
750
when (here isthesource oftoday’s achievement, themanwhomade
itallpossible—Dr.Robert Stadler!”
Kseemed tohimforaninstant thathesawanincongruous look
ontheworn, cynical faces ofthenewsmen, alook thatwasnotquite
respect, expectation orhope, butmore likeanecho ofthese, likea
faint reflection ofthelook theymight haveworn intheir youth on
hearing thename ofRobeit Stadler. Inthat instant, hefeltanim-
pulsewhich hewould notacknowledge: theimpulse totellthem that
heknew nothing about today's event, that hispower counted for
lessthan theirs, thathehadbeen brought here asapawn insome
confidence game, almost as ...asaprisoner.
Instead, heheard himself answering their questions inthesmug,
condescending toneofamanwhoshares allthesecrets ofthehighest
authorities- “Yes, theStale Science Institute isproud ofitsrecord
ofpublic service. ...The State Science Institute isnotthetoolof
anyprivate interests orpersonal greed, ifisdevoted tothewelfare
ofmankind, tothegood ofhumanity asawhole—”spouting, like a
dictaphone, thesickening generalities hehadhcaid from Dr.Ferris.
Hewould notpermit himself toknow thatwhat hefeltwas self-
loathing; heidentified theemotion, butnot itsobject; itwasloathing
forthemenaround him, hethought; itwastheywhowere forcing
him togothrough thisshameful performance. What canyoudo—
hethought—when youhave todealwithpeople?
lhenewsmen weremaking brief notes ofhisanswers. Their faces
nowhadthelook ofautomatons acting outtheroutine ofpretending
thattheywere hearing news intheempty utterances ofanother
automaton.
“Dr. Stadler," asked oneofthem, pointing atthebuilding onthe
knoll, “is ittruethatyouconsider ProjectXthegreatest achievement
oftheState Science Institute''”
There was adead drop ofsilence.
“Project . . .X ..?”saidDrStadler.
Heknew thatsomething wasominously wrong tnthetone ofhis
voice, because hesawtheheads ofthenewsmen goup,asatthe
sound ofanalarm; hesawthem wailing, their pencils poised.
Forone instant, while hefeltthemuscles ofhisfacecracking into
thefraud ofasmile, hefeltaformless, analmost supernatural terror,
asifliesensed again thesilent working ofsome smooth machine, as
ifhewere caught in it,part of itanddoing itsirrevocable will.
Project X?"hesaid softly, inthemysterious tone ofaconspirator.
“Well, gentlemen, thevalue—andthemotive— ofanyachievement
oftheState Science Institute arenottobedoubted, since itisa
nonprofit venture— need Isaymore?”
Heraised hishead andnoticed thatDr.Ferris hadstood onthe
edgeofthegroup through thewhole oftheinterview. Hewondered
whether heimagined thatthelookonDr.Ferris’ lacenowseemed
•csstense—andmore impertinent.
Tworesplendent carscame shooting atfullspeed intotheparking
•otandstopped with aflourish ofscreeching brakes. Thenewsmen
deserted him inthemiddle ofasentence andwent running tomeet
•hegroup alighting from thecars.
75i
Dr.Stadlcr turned toFerris. "What isProject X?”+
heasked
sternly.
Dr.Ferris smiled inamanner ofinnocence andinsolence together.
“Anon-profit venture,” heanswered—andwent running offtomeet
thenewcomers.
From therespectful whispers ofthecrowd, Dr.Stadler learned
thatthe littleman inawilted linen suit,wholooked likeashyster,
striding briskly inthecenter ofthenewgroup, wasMr.Thompson,
theHead oftheState. Mr.Thompson was smiling, frowning and
barking answers tothenewsmen. Dr.Ferris wasweaving through
thegroup, with thegrace ofacatrubbing against sundry legs.
Thegroup came closer andhesaw Ferris steering them inhis
direction. "Mr.Thompson,” saidDr.Ferris sonorously, asthey ap-
proached, "may 1present Dr.Robert Stadler?”
Dr.Stadler sawthe little shyster’s eyesstudying him forthefrac-
tionofasecond: theeyeshadatouch ofsuperstitious awe, asatthe
sight ofaphenomenon from amystical realm forever incomprehensi-
bletoMr.Thompson— andtheyhadthepiercing, calculating shrewd-
nessofaward heeler who feels certain thatnothing isimmune from
hisstandards, aglance likethevisual equivalent ofthewords; What's
your angle?
"It’sanhonor. Doctor, anhonor. I'msure,” saidMr.Thompson
briskly, shaking hishand.
Helearned thatthe tall,stoop-shouldered manwith acrew haircut
wasMr.Wesley Mouch. Hedidnotcatch thenames oftheothers,
whose hands heshook. Asthegroup proceeded toward theofficials'
grandstand, hewas leftwith theburning sensation ofadiscovery he
dared notface: thediscovery thathehad feltanxiously pleased by
the little shyster's nodofapproval.
Aparty ofyoung attendants, wholooked likemovie theater ush-
ers,appeared fromsomewhere with handcarts ofglittering objects,
which theyproceeded todistribute totheassembly. Theobjects were
field glasses. Dr.Ferris took hisplace atthemicrophone ofapublic-
address system bythe officials’ stand. Atasignal from Wesley
Mouch, hisvoiceboomed suddenly over theprairie, anunctuous,
fraudulently solemn voice magnified bythemicrophone inventor's
ingenuity intothesound andpower ofagiant:
"Ladies andgentlemen .. .!”
Thecrowd wasstruck into silence, allheads jerking unanimously
toward thegraceful figure ofDr.Floyd Ferris.
"Ladies andgentlemen, youhavebeenchosen—inrecognition of
your distinguished public service and social loyalty—towitness the
unveiling ofascientific achievement ofsuchtremendous importance,
such staggering scope, suchepoch-making |K)ssibilities thatuptothis
moment ithasbeenknown only toaveryfewandonly asProject X.”
Dr.Stadler focused hisfield glasses onflhe only thing insight-
ontheblotch ofthedistant farm.)
Hesawthat itwasthedeserted ruinofafarmhouse, which hadob-
viously beenabandoned years ago.Thedightof theskyshowed through
thenaked ribsoftheroof,andjagged bits*ofglassframed thedark-
nessofempty windows. Hesawasagging barn, therusted tower of
752
awater wheel, andtheremnant ofatractor lying upturned with its
treads inthe air.
Dr.Ferris was talking about thecrusaders ofscience andabout
theyears ofselfless devotion, unremitting toilandpersevering re-
search thathadgone intoProject X.
Itwasodd—thought Dr.Stadler, studying theruins ofthefarm—
thatthere should beaherd ofgoats inthemidst ofsuch desolation.
There were sixorseven ofthem, some drowsing, some munching
lethargically atwhatever grass they could findamong thesun-
scorched weeds.
“Project X,”Dr.Ferris wassaying, “was devoted tosome special
research inthefieldofsound. Thescience ofsound hasastonishing
aspects, which laymen would scarcely suspect. ...”
Some fifty feetaway from thefarmhouse, Dr.Stadler sawastruc-
ture, obviously newandofnopossible purpose whatever: itlooked
likeafewspans ofasteel trestle, rising intoempty space, supporting
nothing, leading nowhere.
Dr.Ferris wasnow talking about thenature ofsound vibrations.
Dr.Stadler aimed hisfield glasses atthehorizon beyond thefarm,
butthere wasnothing elsetobeseen fordozens ofmiles. Thesud-
den, straining motion ofoneofthegoats brought hiseyesback to
theherd.Henoticed thatthegoats were chained tostakes driven
atintervals intotheground.
. .And itwasdiscovered,” said Dr. Ferris, “that there arc
certain Irequendcs ofsound vibration which nostructure, organic or
inorganic, canwithstand. ...”
DrStadler noticed asilvery spotbouncing over theweeds among
theherd. Itwasakidthathadnotbeen chained: itkept leaping and
weaving about itsmother.
“...Thesound ray iscontrolled byapanel inside thegiant under-
ground laboratory,” saidDr.Ferris, pointing atthebuilding onthe
knoll. “That panel isknown tousaffectionately asthe‘Xylophone'—
because onemust bedarn careful tostrike theright keys, or,rather,
topulltheright levers. Foi thisspecial occasion, anextension Xylo-
phone, connected totheone inside, hasbeen erected here”— he
pointed totheswitchboard infront ofthe officials' stand—“sothat
youmaywitness theentire operation andseethesimplicity ofthe
whole procedure. ..”
Dr.Stadler found pleasure inwatching thekid.asoothing, reassur-
ingkind ofpleasure. The little creature seemed barely aweek old,
itlooked likeaballofwhite furwith graceful long legs, itkept
bounding inamanner ofdeliberate, gaily ferocious awkwardness, all
fouiofitslegsheld stiffand straight. Itseemed tobeleaping atthe
sunrays, atthesummer air,atthejoyofdiscovering itsown exis-
tence.
“...Thesound ray isinvisible, inaudible and fully controllable in
respect totarget, direction andrange. Itsfirstpublic test,which you
areabout towitness, hasbeen settocover asmall sector, amere
twomiles, inperfect safety, with allspace cleared fortwenty miles
beyond. Thepresent generating equipment inourlaboratory iscapa-
bleofproducing rays tocover—through theoutlets which youmay
753
observe under thedome—theentire countryside within 'aradius of
ahundred miles, acircle with aperiphery extending from theshore
oftheMississippi, roughly from thebridge oftheTaggart Transconti-
nental Railroad, toDesMoines andFortDodge, Iowa, toAustin,
Minnesota, toWoodman, Wisconsin, toRock Island, Illinois. This is
only amodest beginning. Wepossess thetechnical knowledge to
build generators with arange oftwoandthree hundred miles— but
duetothefactthatwcwere unable toobtain intime asufficient
quantity ofahighly heat-resistant metal, such asRearden Metal, we
hadtobesatisfied withourpresent equipment andradius ofcontrol.
Inhonor ofourgreat executive, Mr.Thompson, under whose farsighted
administration theState Science Institute wasgranted thefunds without
which ProjectXwould nothavebeen possible, thisgreat invention will
henceforth beknown astheThompson Harmonizer!”
Thecrowd applauded. Mr.Thompson satmotionless, with hisface
held self-consciously stiff. Dr.Stadlcr feltcertain that thissmall-time
shyster hadhadaslittle todowith theProject asanyofthemovie-
usher attendants, thathepossessed neither themind northe initia-
tivenoreven thesufficient degree ofmalice tocause anewgopher
trap tobebrought intotheworld, that he,too,wasonly thepawn
ofasilent machine—amachine thathadnocenter, noleader, no
direction, amachine thathadnotbeen setmmotion byDr.Ferris
orWesley Mouch, oranyofthecowed creatures inthegrandstands,
oranyofthecreatures behind thescenes— -animpersonal, unthink-
ing,unembodied machine, ofwhich nuncwasthedriver and allwere
thepawns, each tothedegree ofhisevil. Dr.Stadlei gripped the
edge ofthebench: hefeltadesire toleap tohisfeetandrun.
. .Astothefunction andthepurpose ofthesound ray, 1shall
saynothing. Ishall let itspeak for itself.You willnowsee itwork.
When Dr.Blodgett pulls thelevers oftheXylophone, Isuggest that

haslongbeenconceded byallprogressive thinkers thatthere areno
entities, only actions—andnovalues, onlyconsequences. Now, ladies
andgentlemen, you willseetheaction andtheconsequences ofthe
Thompson Harmonizer.”
Dr.Ferris bowed, walked slowly away from themicrophone and
came totake hisseatonthebench beside Dr.Stadler.
Ayoungish, fattish kind ofman took hisstand bytheswitch-
board—andraised hiseyes expectantly toward Mr.Thompson. Mr.
Thompson looked blankly bewildered foraninstant, asifsomething
hadslipped hismind, untilWesley Mouch leaned overandwhispered
someword into hisear.“Contact!” saidMr.Thompson loudly.
Dr.Stadler could notbear towatch lh£graceful, undulating, ef-
feminate motion ofDr.Blodgett’s hand asitpulled the firstlever of
theswitchboard, thenthenext.Heraised nisfield glasses andlooked
atthefarmhouse.
Intheinstant when hefocused hislen^, agoatwaspulling atits
chain, reaching placidly foratall,drythistle. Inthenext instant, the
goat rose intothe air,upturned, itslegsStretching upward and jer-
king, then fellintoagray pilemade ofseven goats inconvulsions.
754
Bythetime Dr.Stadler believed it,thepilewasmotionless, except
foronebeast’s legsticking outofthemass, stiffasarodandshaking
asinastrong wind.Thefarmhouse tore into strips ofclapboard and
wentdown, followed byageyser ofthebricks ofitschimney. The
tractor vanished into apancake. 'Hiewater tower cracked and its
shreds hittheground while itswheel was stilldescribing alongcurve
through the air,asifotitsown leisurely volition. The steelbeams
andgirders ofthesolidnew trestle collapsed likeastructure of
matchsticks under thebreath ofasigh. Itwassoswift, souncon-
tested, sosimple, thatDr.Stadler feltnohorror, hefeltnothing, it
was notthereality hehadknown, itwastherealm ofachild’s
nightmare where material objects could bedissolved bymeans ofa
single malevolent wish.
Hemoved the field glasses from hiseyes.Hewaslooking atan
empty prairie. There wasnotarm, there wasnothing inthedistance
except adarkish strip thatlooked liketheshadow ofacloud.
Asingle, high, thinscream rosefrom thetiersbehind him, assome
woman fainted. Hewondered whysheshould scream solong after
thefact—andthenherealized thatthetime elapsed since thetouch

Heraised hisheld glasses again, almost asifhewere suddenly
hoping that thecloud shadow would beallhewould see.Butthe
material objects were still there; theywere amount otrefuse. He
moved hisglasses over thewreckage, inamoment, herealized that

When helowered theglasses andturned, hefound Dr.Ferris
looking athim.Hefeltcertain thatthrough thewhole ofthetest, it
wasnotthetarget, itwas hislace that Ferris hadwatched, asifto
seewhether he,Robert Stadler, could withstand theray.
“Ihat’s allthere istoit,”the laltish Dr.Blodgett announced
through themicrophone, mtheingratiating sales toneofadepartment-
store floorwalker. “There isnonailorrivetremaining intheframe
ofthestructures andthere isnoblood vessel leftunbroken inthe
bodies oftheanimals.”
Thecrowd was rustling with jerkymovements andhigh-pitched
whispers People were looking atoneanother, rising uncertainly and
dropping down again, restlessly demanding anything butthispause.
There wasasound ofsubmerged hysteria inthewhispers. They
seemed tobewaiting tobetoldwhat tothink.
Dr.Stadler sawawoman being escorted down thesteps from the
back row, herhead bent, ahandkerchief pressed tohermouth: she
wassicktoherstomach.
Heturned away andsaw thatDr.Ferris was stillwatching him.
Dr.Stadler leaned back alittle, hisface austere and scornful, the
faceofthenation’s greatest scientist, andasked.“Who invented that
ghastly thing?”
“You did,”
Dr.Stadler looked athim, notmoving.
“It ismerely apractical appliance,” said Dr,Ferns pleasantly*
“based upon your theoretical discoveries. Uwasderived from your
755
invaluable research intothenature ofcosmic raysandofthespatial
transmission ofenergy.”
“Who worked ontheProject?”
“Afew third-raters, asyouwould callthem. Really, there was
very little difficulty. None ofthem could havebegun toconceive of
the firststeptoward theconcept ofyour energy-transmission for-
mula, butgiven that—therestWaseasy.”
“What isthepractical purpose ofthisinvention? What arethe
‘epoch-making possibilities”?”
“Oh, butdon't yousee? Itisaninvaluable instrument ofpublic
security. Noenemy would attack thepossessor ofsuch aweapon. It
will setthecountry freefrom thefearofaggression andpermit it
toplan itsfuture inundisturbed safety.” Hisvoice hadanoddcare-
lessness. anote ofoffhand improvisation, asifhewere neither ex-
pecting norattempting tobebelieved. “Itwillrelieve social frictions.
Itwillpromote peace, stability and— aswehave indicated—harmony.
Itwilleliminate alldanger ofwar/’
“What war?What aggression? With thewhole world starving and
allthose People's vStates barely subsisting onhandouts from this
country—where doyousecanydanger ofwar ?Doyouexpect those
ragged savages toattack you?”
Dr.Ferris looked straight into hiseyes. “Internal enemies canbe
asgreat adanger tothepeople asexternal ones.” heanswered.
“Perhaps greater.” This time hisvoice sounded asifheexpected
andwascertain tobeunderstood. “Social systems aresoprecarious.
Butthink ofwhat stability could beachieved byafew scientific
installations atstrategic key points. Itwould guarantee astate of
permanent peace—don't youthink so?”
Dr.Stadler didnotmove oranswer; astheseconds clicked past
and hisface stillheld anunchanged expression, itbegan tolook
paralyzed. Hiseyeshadthestare ofamanwhosuddenly sees that
which hehadknown, hadknown from the first,hadspent years
trying nottosee,andwho isnowengaged inacontest between the
sightand hispower todeny itsexistence. “1don’tknow what you’re
talking about!” hesnapped atlast.
Dr.Ferris smiled. “No private businessman orgreedy industrialist
would have financed Project X,”hesaid softly, inthetone ofanidle,
informal discussion. “Hecouldn’t have afforded it.It’sanenormous
investment, withnoprospect ofmaterial gain.What profit could he
expect from it?There arenoprofits henceforth tobederived from
thatfarm.” Hepointed atthedark strip inthedistance. “But, as
youhave sowellobserved. Project Xhadtobeanon-profit venture.
Contrary toabusiness firm, theState Science Institute hadnotrou-
bleinobtaining funds fortheProject. Yi>uhave notheard ofthe
Institute having anyfinancial difficulties thepasttwoyears, have
you?And itused tobesuch aproblem -(-getting them tovote the
funds necessary fortheadvancement offscience. They always de-
manded gadgets fortheir cash, asyou usefd tosay.Well, herewas a
gadget which some people inpower cou!d| fully appreciate. They got
theothers tovote forititwasn’t difficult. Infact, agreatmany of
those others feltsafe invoting money foraproject thatwassecret—
756
they fellcertain itwasimportant, since theywere notconsidered
important enough tobeletinon it.There were, ofcourse, afew
skeptics anddoubters. Buttheygave inwhen theywere reminded
thatthehead oftheState Science Institute wasDr.Robert Stadler—
whose judgment and integrity theycould notdoubt.”
Or.Stadler waslooking down athisfingernails.
Thesudden screech ofthemicrophone jerked thecrowd intoan
instantaneous attentiveness; people seemed tobeasecond’s worth
ofsdf-control away from panic.Anannounce!, with avoice likea
machine gun spitting smiles, barked cheerily thattheywerenow to
witness theradio broadcast thatwould break thenews ofthegreat
discovery tothewhole nation. Then, with aglance athiswatch, his
script andthesignaling arm ofWesley Mouch. heveiled into the
spaikling snake-head ofthemicrophone —intotheliving rooms, the
offices, thestudies, thenurseries ofthecountry. ‘Ladies andgentle-
men! Project X!”
Dr.Ferris leaned toward Dr.Stadler- through thestaccato hoof-
beats oftheannouncer’s voice galloping across thecontinent with a
description ofthenewinvention— andsaid inthetone ofacasual
remark. “It isvitally important that there benocriticism ofthe
Project inthecountry atthisprecarious time,” thenadded semi-
accidentally, asasemi-joke, “that there benocriticism ofanything
atanytime.'
*
*andthenation’s political, cultural, intellectual andmoral lead
ers,” theannouncer was yelling into themicrophone, “who have
witnessed thisgreat event, asyour lepresentatives and inyourname,
willnow tellyou their views of itinperson!”
Mr.Ihompson wasthe first tomount thewooden steps tothe
platform ofthemicrophone liesnapped hiswaythrough abrief
speech, hailing anew eraanddeclaring —inthebelligerent tone of
achallenge tounidentified enemies— that science belonged tothe
people andthateverymanontheface oftheglobe hadaright to
ashare oftheadvantages created bvtechnological progress.
Wesley Mouch came next.Hespoke about social planning andthe
necessity ofunanimous rallying insupport oftheplanners. Hespoke
about discipline, unity, austerity andthepatriotic duty ofbearing
temporary hardships. “We have mobilized thebest brains ofthe
country towork toryour welfare. This great invention wastheprod-
uctofthegenms ofamanwhose devotion tothecause ofhumanity
isnottobequestioned, amanacknowledged byallasthegreatest
mind ofthecentury—Dr.Robert Stadler!”
“What?"gasped Dr.Stadler, whirling toward Ferris.
Dr.Ferris looked athimwith aglance ofpatient mildness.
“He didn’t askmypermission tosaythat!” Dr.Stadler half-
snapped, half-whispered.
Dr.Ferris spread outhishands inagesture ofreproachful help-
lessness. “Now you see.Dr.Stadler, how unfortunate itisifyou
allow yourself tobedisturbed bypolitical matters, which youhave
always considered unworthy ofyour attention andknowledge. You
see, itisnotMr.Mouch ’sfunction toaskpermissions.”
The figure now slouching against theskyonthespeakers’ plat-
757
form, coiling itself about themicrophone, talking inthebored, con-
temptuous tone ofanoff-color story, wasDr.Simon Pritchett. He
wasdeclaring that thenew invention wasaninstrument ofsocial
welfare, which guaranteed general prosperity, and thatanyone who
doubted thisself-evident factwasanenemy ofsociety, tobetreated
accordingly. “This invention, theproduct ofDr.Robert Sladler, the
pre-eminent lover offreedom— *'
Dr.Ferris opened abriefcase, produced some pages olneatly
typed copyandturned toDr.Stadler. ‘You aretobetheclimax of
thebroadcast,” hesaid.“You willspeak last, attheendofthehour.”
Heextended thepages. “Here's thespeech you’ll make.” Hiseyes
said the rest: they said that hischoice ofwords hadnotbeen
accidental.
Dr.Stadler took thepages, butheldthem between thetipsoftwo
straight fingers, asonemight hold ascrap ofwaste paper about to
betossed aside. “Ihaven’t asked youtoappoint yourself asmyghost
writer,” hesaid.Thesarcasm ofthevoice gave Ferris hisclue: this
wasnotamoment forsarcasm.
“Icouldn't have allowed your invaluable time tobetaken upby
thewriting ofradio speeches,” said Dr.Fern's. “1feltcertain that
youwould appreciate it.”Hesaid itinatoneofspurious politeness
intended toberecognized asspurious, thetoneoftossing toabeggar
thealms offace-saving.
DrStadlcr’s answer disturbed him: Dr.Stadler didnotchoose to
answer ortoglance down atthemanuscript.
“Lack offaith.” abeefy speaker wassnarling antheplatform, in
thetone ofastreet brawl, “lack offaith istheonly thingwegotto
fear! Ifwehave faith intheplans ofourleaders, why, theplans will
work and we’ll allhave prosperity andeaseand plenty. It’sthe fel-
lowswhogoaround doubting anddestroying ourmorale, it'sthey
who’re keeping usinshortages andmisery. Butwe're notgoing to
letthemdo itmuch longer, we’re here toprotect thepeople— and
ifanyofthose doubting smarties come around, believe youme,we’ll
take careofthem!”
“Itwould beunfortunate,” said Dr.Ferris inasoft voice, “to
arouse popular resentment against theState Science Institute atan
explosive time likethepresent. There’s agreat dealofdissatisfaction
andunrest inthecountry—and ilpeople should misunderstand the
nature ofthenewinvention, they’re liable tovent their rageon all
scientists. Scientists have never been popular with themasses.”
“Peace,” atall,willowy woman wassighing intothemicrophone,
“this invention isagreat, newinstrument ofpeace. Itwillprotect
usfrom theaggressive designs ofselfish enemies, itwillallow usto
breathe freely andtolearn toloveourfellow men.” Shehadabony
face w'ithamouth embittered atcocktail parties, andwore aflowing
palebluegown, suggesting theconcert garment ofaharpist. “Itmay
wellbeconsidered asthatmiracle whichlwas thought impossible in
history—thedream oftheages—the linitl synthesis ofscience and
love!”
Dr.Stadler looked atthefaces inthegrandstands. They were
sitting quietly now, theywere listening, battheir eyeshadanebbing
758
look oftwilight, alook offear intheprocess ofbeing accepted as
permanent, thelook ofrawwounds beingdimmed bythe veilof
infection. They knew, asheknew it,thattheywere thetargets of
theshapeless funnels protruding from themushroom building’s
dome—andhewondered inwhatmanner theywerenowextinguish-
ingtheirminds andescaping thatknowledge; heknew thatthewords
theywere eager toabsorb andbelieve were thechains slipping in
toholdthem, likethegoats, securely within therange ofthose fun-
nels.They were eager tobelieve; hesawthetightening lines oftheir
lips,hesawtheoccasional glances ofsuspicion theythrew attheir
neighbors— asifthehorror thatthreatened themwasnotthesound
ray,butthemenwhowould make them acknowledge itashorror.
Their eyeswere veiling over, buttheremnant look ofawound was
acryforhelp.
"Why doyouthink theythink?" saidDr.Ferris softly. "Reason
isthescientist’s onlyweapon-- andreason hasnopower overmen,
has it?Atatime likeours, with thecountry falling apart, with the
mob driven byblind desperation totheedge ofopen riotsandvio-
lence-order must bemaintained byanymeans available. What can
wedowhenwrehave todeal withpeople?"
Di.Stadicr didnotanswer.
Afat,jellied woman, withaninadequate brassiere under adark,
peispiration-stained dress, was saying into themicrophone —Dr.
Stadicr could notbelieve itatfirst—thatthenewinvention wasto
begreeted with particular gratitude bythemothers ofthecountry.
Dr.Stadlei turned away; watching him, Ferris could seenothing
butthenoble lineolthehighforehead andthedeep cutofbitterness
atthecorner ofthemouth.
Suddenly, without context orwarning. Robert Stadler whirled to
face him. Itwas like aspurt ofblood from asudden crack ina
wound thathadalmost closed: Stadlei 'sfacewasopen, open inpain,
mhorror, insincerity, as it,forthatmoment, bothheand Ferris
werehuman beings, while hemoaned with incredulous despair:
‘inacivili/cd century. Ferris, inacivilized century!"
Dr.Ferris took histime toproduce andprolong asoftchuckle. "1
don'tknow what you're talking about." heanswered inthetone of
aquotation.
Dr.Stadler lowered hiseyes.
When Ferris spoke again, hisvoice hadthefaintest edge ofatone
which Stadler could notdefine, except that itdidnotbelong inany
civilized discussion: "Itwould beunfortunate ifanything were to
happen tojeopardize theState Science Institute. Itwould bemast
unfortunate iftheInstitute were tobeclosed —or ifanyoneofus
were tobeforced toleave it.Where would wego? Scientists are
aninordinate luxury these days—andthere aren’t many people or
establishments leftwho’re able toafford necessities, letalone luxu-
ries.There arenodoors leftopen tous.Wewouldn’t bewelcome
intheresearch department ofanindustrial concern, such as—letus
say—Rearden Steel. Resides, ifweshould happen tomake enemies,
thesame enemies would befeared byanyperson tempted toemploy
our talents.Aman likeRearden would have fought forus.Would
759
aman tikeOrren Boyle? But this ispurely theoretical speculation,
because, asamatter ofpractical fact, allprivate establishments of
scientific research have beendosed bylaw—byDirective 10-289,
issued, asyoumight not realize, byMrWesley Mouch. Areyou
.thinking, perhaps, ofuniversities? They areinthesame position.
They can't afford tomake enemies. Whowould speak upforus? I
believe thatsome suchman asHugh Akston would havecome to
ourdefense—buttothink ofthat istobeguilty ofananachronism.
Hebelonged toadifferent age.Theconditions setupinoursocial
andeconomic reality have long sincemade hiscontinued existence
impossible. And ldon't think thatDr,Simon Pritchett, orthegener-
ation reared under hisguidance, would beableorwilling todefend
us.Ihavenever believed intheefficacy ofidealists—haveyou?—and
this isnoageforimpractical idealism. Ifanyone wished tooppose a
government policy, howwould hemake himself heard? Through
these gentlemen ofthepress, Dr.Stadler? Through thismicrophone?
Isthere anindependent newspaper left inthecountry? Anuncon-
trolled radio station? Aprivate piece ofproperty, forthatmatter—
orapersonal opinion?” Thetone ofthevoice wasobvious now: it
wasthetone ofathug.“Apersonal opinion istheoneluxury that
nobody canafford today.”
Dr.Stadler's lipsmoved stiffly, asstiffly asthemuscles ofthe
goats. “You arespeaking toRobert Stadler.”
“Ihave notforgotten that. Itisprecisely because 1havenotforgot-
ten itthat Iamspeaking, ‘Robert Stadler’ isanillustrious name,
which 1would hate loseedestroyed. Butwhat isanillustrious name
nowadays? Inwhose eyes?” Hisarmswept over thegrandstands.
“Intheeyes ofpeople such asyouseearound you? Ifthey will
*believe, when sotold, thataninstrument ofdeath isatoolofpros-
perity—would they notbelieve itiftheywere told thatRobert
Stadler isatraitor andanenemy oftheState? Would youthen rely
onthefact that this isnottrue? Areyouthinking oftruth, Dr.
Stadler? Questions oftruthdonotenter into social issues. Principles
have noinfluence onpublic affairs. Reason hasnopower over
human beings. Logic isimpotent. Morality issuperfluous. Donot
answer menow, Dr.Stadler. You willanswer meover themicro-
phone. You’re thenextspeaker.”
Looking offatthedark strip ofthefarm inthedistance. Dr.
Stadler knew thatwhat hefeltwas terror, buthewould notpermit
himself toknow itsnature. He,whohadbeen able tostudy the
particles andsubparticles ofcosmic space, would notpermit himself
toexamine hisfeeling andtoknow that itwasmade ofthree parts:
onepartwasterror ofavision thatseemed tostand before hiseyes,
thevision oftheinscription cut, inhishoiior, over thedoor ofthe
Institute: “Tothefearless mind, totheinviclatc truth”—another part
was plain, brute, animal fearofphysical destruction, ahumiliating
fearwhich, inthecivilized world ofhisyojuth, hehadnotexpected
ever toexperience—andthethirdwasthdterror oftheknowledge
thatbybetraying the first,one delivers dneself intotherealm of
thesecond.
Hewalked toward thespeaker's scaffold, hissteps firmandslow,
760
hishead lifted, themanuscript ofthespeech heldcrumpled inhis
fingers. Itlooked like awalk tomount either apedestal oraguillo-
tine.Asthewhole ofaman’s lifeflashes before him inhisdying
moment, sohewalked tothesound oftheannouncer’s voice reading
tothecountry the listofRobert Stadler’s achievements andcareer.
Afaint convulsion ranover Robert Stadler's face atthewords:
“—former head oftheDepartment ofPhysics ofthePatrick Henry
University.” Heknew, distantly, notasiftheknowledge were within
him, butasifitwere within some person hewasleaving behind,
that thecrowd wasabout towitness anactofdestruction more
terrible than thedestruction ofthefarm.
Hehadmounted the firstthree steps ofthescaffold, when ayoung
newsman toreforward, rantohimand,from below, seized therailing
tostop him.“Dr. Stadler!” hecried inadesperate whisper. “Tell
them thetruth! Tellthem thatyouhadnothing todowith it!Tell
them what sortofinfernal machine itisandforwhat purpose it’s
intended tobeused! Tell thecountry what sortofpeople aretrying
torule it!Nobody candoubt yourword! Tellthem thetruth! Save
us!You’re theonlyonewhocan!”
Dr.Stadler looked down athim.Hewasyoung: hismovements
andvoice hadthat swift, sharp clarity which belongs tocompetence;
among hisaged, corrupt, favor-ridden andpull-created colleagues,
hehadmanaged toachieve therank ofelite ofthepolitical press,
bymeans and intheroleofalast, irresistible spark ofability. His
eyeshadthelook ofaneager, unfrightened intelligence; theywere
thekind ofeyesDrStadler hadseen looking upathimfrom the
benches ofclassrooms. Henoticed that thisboy's eyeswere hazel;
theyhadatinge ofgreen.
Dr.Stadler turned hisheadandsawthat Ferris hadcome rushing
tohisside, likeaservant orajailer. “Idonotexpect tobeinsulted
bydisloyal young punks with treasonable motives.” said Dr.Stadler
loudly.
Dr.Ferris whirled upon theyoung manandsnapped, hisfaceout
ofcontrol, distorted byrage attheunexpected andunplanned, “Give

Theskyhadthestagnant breath ofafurnace andthestreets of
NewYork were likepipes running, notwith airand light, butwith
melted dust.Dagny stood onastreet corner, where theairport bus
had lefther,looking atthecity inpassive astonishment. The build-
ingsseemed worn byweeks ofsummer heat, butthepeople seemed
wornbycenturies ofanguish. Shestood watching them, disarmed by
anenormous sense ofunreality.
That sense ofunreality hadbeen heronly feeling since theearly
hours ofthemorning—since themoment when, attheendofan
761
empty highway, shehadwalked intoanunknown town andstopped
the firstpasser-by toaskwhere shewas,
“Watsonville,” heanswered. “What state, please?” sheasked. The
manglanced ather, said,“Nebraska," andwalked hastily away. She
smiled mirthlessly, knowing thathewondered where shehadcome
fromandthatnoexplanation hecould imagine would beasfantastic
asthetruth. Yet itwasWatsonville thatseemed fantastic toher,as
shewalked through itsstreets totherailroad station. Shehad lost
thehabit ofobserving despair asthenormal anddominant aspect
ofhuman existence, sonormal astobecome unnoticed— andthe
sight ofitstruck her inallofitssenseless futility. Shewasseeing
thebrand ofpainandfearonthefaces ofpeople, andthelook of
evasion that refuses toknow it—theyseemed tobegoing through
themotions ofsomeenormous pretense, acting outaritual toward
offreality, letting theearth remain unseen andtheir lives unlived,
indread ofsomething namelessly forbidden— yettheforbidden was
thesimple actoflooking atthenature oftheir painandquestioning
their duty tobear it.Shewasseeing itsoclearly thatshekeptwant-
ingtoapproach strangers, toshake them, tolaugh intheir facesand
tocry,“Snap outofit!”
There wasnoreason forpeople tobeasunhappy asthat, she
thought, noreason whatever . . .andthen sheremembered that
reason wastheonepower theyhadbanished from their existence
Sheboarded aTaggart train forthenearest aiifield; shedidnot
identify herself toanyone: itseemed irrelevant. She satatthewin-
dow o!acoach, like astranger whohastolearn theincomprehensi-
blelanguage ofthose around her.Shepicked upadiscarded
newspaper; shemanaged, with ellort, tounderstand whatwas writ-
ten,butnotwhy itshould everhavebeen written: itailseemed so
childishly senseless. Shestared inastonishment ataparagiaph ina
syndicated column fromNew York, which stated overemphatically
thatMr.James Taggart wished ittobeknown that hissister had
died inanairplane ctash, anyunpatriotic rumors tothecontrary
notwithstanding. Slowly, sheremembered Directive 10-289 and real-
ized thatJimwasembarrassed bythepublic suspicion thatshehad
vanished asadeserter.
Thewording oftheparagraph suggested thatherdisappearance
hadbeen aprominent public issue, notyetdropped. There wete
other suggestions of it:amention ofMiss Taggart’s tragic death, in
astory about thegrowing number ofplane crashes—and,onthe
back page, anad,offering a$100,000 reward totheperson who
would findthewreckage ofherplane, signed byHenry Reardon.
The lastgave herastabofurgency; thetestseemed meaningless.
Then, slowly, sherealized thatherreturn v^as apublic event which
would betaken asbignews. She feltalethargic weariness atthe
prospect ofadramatic homecoming, offacing Jimandthepress, of
witnessing theexcitement. Shewished the^would get itover with
inherabsence.
Attheairfield, shesawasmall-town reporter interviewing some
departing officials. Shewaited tillhehad finished, then sheap-
proached him,extended hercredentials andsaid quietly, tothegap-
762
ingstare ofhiseyes,‘TmDagny Taggart. Would youmake itknown,
please, thatI'maliveandthat I’llheinNewYork thisafternoon?’'
Theplane wasabout totake oftandsheescaped thenecessity of
answering questions.
Shewatched theprairies, the rivers, thetowns slipping past at
anuntouchable distance below—andshenoted that thesense of
detachment one leclswhen looking attheearth from aplane was
thesame sense she feltwhen looking atpeople: only herdistance
from people seemed longer.
Thepassengers were listening tosome radio broadcast, which ap-
peared tobeimportant; judging bytheir earnest attentiveness. She
caught brief snatches otfraudulent voices talking about some sort
oinewinvention thatwastobringsome undefined benefits tosome
undefined public’s welfare. Thewords were obviously chosen tocon-
veynospecific meaning whatever; shewondered howonecould pre-
tend thatonewashearing aspeech; yetthatwaswhat thepassengers
were doing: They were going through theperformance ofachild
who, notyetable toread, holds abookopen andspells outanything
hewishes tospell, pretending that itiscontained mtheincomprehen-
sible black lines Butthechild, shethought, knows thatheisplaying
agame; these people pretend tothemselves thatthey arenotpre-
tending; theyknow noother state ofexistence.
Thesense ofunreality remained asheronly feeling, when she
landed, when sheescaped acrowd ofreporters without being seen--
byavoiding thetaxistands andleaping into theairport bus—when
sherodeonthebus,then stood onastreet coiner, looking atNew
York She feltasifshewere seeing anabandoned city.
She feltnosense ofhomecoming, when sheentered herapartment;
theplaceseemed tobeaconvenient machine thatshecould usefor
some purpose ofnosignificance whatever.
Butshe feltaquickened touch ofenergy, likethe firstbreak ina
log— -atouch ofmeaning -when shepicked upthetelephone re-
ceiver andcalled Rearden's office inPennsylvania.
“Oh, MissTaggart . .MissTaggart!" said, inajoyous moan, the
voice ofthesevere, unemotional Miss Ives.
“Hello. Miss Ives, Ihaven’t startled you.have I?Youknew that

“Oh yes! Iheard itontheradio thismorning."
“IsMr.Renden inhisoffice0"

"What hotel isit?"
"The Eldorado Hotel, inLosGatos."
"Thank you.Miss Ives." Shewasabout tohang up.
"Oh, Miss Taggart!"
763
"Yes?”
“What was itthathappened toyou?Where wereyou?”
“I ,..HIteJIyouwhen Iseeyou.I'm inNewYork now.When
Mr.Rcarden calls, tellhimplease that I'llbeinmyoffice.”
“Yes, Miss Taggart.”
Shehung up,butherhandremained onthereceiver, clinging to
her firstcontact with amatter thathadimportance. Shelooked at
herapartment and atthecity inthewindow, feeling reluctant to
sinkagain intothedead fogofthemeaningless.
Sheraised thereceiver andcalled LosGatos.
“Eldorado Hotel,” said awoman's drowsily resentful voice,
“Would youtake amessage forMr.Henry Rearden? Askhim,
when hecomes in,to—”
“Just aminute, please,” drawled thevoice, intheimpatient tone
thatresents anyeffort asanimposition.
Sheheard theclicking ofswitches, some buzzing, some breaks of
silence andthen aman’s clear, firm voice answering: “Hello?” It
wasHank Rearden
She stared atthereceiver asatthemuzzle ofagun. feeling
trapped, unable tobreathe.
“Hello?” herepeated.
“Hank isthatyou?”
Sheheard alowsound, more asighthan agasp, andthen the
long,empty crackling ofthewire
“Hank!” There wasnoanswer. “Hank!” shescreamed interror.
Shethought sheheard theeffort ofabreath— then sheheard a
whisper, which wasnotaquestion, but astatement saying every-
thing: “Dagny.”
“Hank. I’msorry—oh,darling. I'msorry!—didn’t youknow?”
“Where areyou,Dagny?”
“Arc you allright9”
“Ofcourse.”J
“Didn’t youknow that Iwasbackand ..andalive?”

“InNew York. Didn't youhearabout itontheradio?”
“No. I’vejustcome in.”
“Didn’t they giveyouamessage tocallMiss Ives?”
“No.”
“Arc you allright?”
“Now?” sheheard hissoft,lowchuckle. Shewashearing thesound
ofunreleased laughter, thesound ofyouth* growing inhisvoice with
every word.“When didyoucome back?”;
“This morning.”
“Dagny, where wereyou?”,
Shedidnotanswer atonce.“Myplane (trashed,” shesaid.“Inthe

Thelaughter went outofhisvoice. “Asbadasthat?”

“Then whycouldn’t yousendword?”
“There wereno . ..nomeans ofcommunication.”

“Dagny, wereyou indanger?”
Thehalf-smiling, half-bitter tone olhervoice wasalmost regret,

“Were youheldprisoner?”
“No—notreally.”
“Then youcould have returned sooner, butdidn’t?”
“That’s true—butthat’s all 1can tellyou.”
“Where were you,Dagny?”

“Ofcourse 1won’t askanyquestions. Just tellme:areyousafe

“Safe? Yes.”

Shestood looking atthesilent receiver. Forthe firsttime since
herreturn, she fellpain, aviolent pain,but itmade heralive, because
itwasworth feeling.
Shetelephoned hersecretary atTaggart Transcontinental, tosay
briefly thatshewould beintheoffice inhalfanhour.
Thestatue ofNathaniel Taggart wasreal—when shestood facing
itintheconcouise ottheTerminal. Itseemed toherthattheywere
alone inavast, echoing temple, with fogcoils offormless ghosts
weaving andvanishing around them. Shestood still,looking upat

thestatue, asforabnetmoment ofdedication. I’mback-»~were the

“Hello.” saidEddie softly, with amuted smile, astoadistant

Theman turned toglance ather.Hehad ayellow complexion,
curly hair, ahard facemade ofsoftmuscles, andtherevolting hand-
someness belonging totheesthetic standards ofbarroom corners; his
blurred brown eyeshadtheempty flatness ofglass.
“Miss Taggart,” said Eddie, inaresonant tone ofseverity, the
tone ofslapping theman into themanners ofadrawing room he
hadnever entered, “may 1present Mr,Meigs>”

“You’ll donothing ofthekind!” shegasped, tooincredulous to
beangry.
Eddie didnotanswer.
Meigs glanced atherwithwhatwould havebeen astonishment if
hiseyeswere capable ofregistering areaction “Send theorders,”
hesaid toEddie, withnoemphasis, andwalked out.
Eddie wasjotting notations onapiece ofpaper.
“Areyoucrazy?” sheasked.
Heraised hiseyes toher,asthough exhausted byhours ofbeating.
“We’ll have to,Pagny,” hesaid, hisvoice dead.
“What isthat?” sheasked, pointing attheouter door thathad
closed onMr.Meigs.
“The Director ofUnification.”
"What?”
“The Washington representative, incharge oftheRailroad Unifi-
cation Plan.”
“What’s that?”

Shesmiled, gently andconfidently, inunderstanding, indismissal
ofallproblems, and said, extending herhand, “All right, Eddie,
Hello.”
Hetook herhandandpressed ittohislips,athing hehadnever
done before, hismanner neither daring norapologetic, butsimply
andopenly personal.
“Itwasaplane crash,” shesaid, “and, Eddie, sothatyouwon’t

“Ihat’s right”

“Yes.”
“Grapefruit?*'
That’s right.”
“Why?”
“Dagny, 'why' isawordnobody usesanylonger.”
After amoment, sheasked, “Have youanyguess about the
reason?”
“Guess? Idon’t have toguess. 1know.'’
“All light, what isit?"
“'Hie grapefruit special istortheSmather brothers. TheSmather
brothers bought afruit ranch inArizona ayear ago,from aman

thepunch board business theyear before. They bought theranch by
means ofaloanfromWashington under aproject forthereclamation
ofdistressed areas, such asArizona. TheSmather brothers have
friends inWashington.”
“Well?”
“Dagny, everybody knows it.Everybody knows how train sched-
uleshavebeen runinthepast three weeks, andwhysome districts

andthat thepublic welfare ofthecityofNewYork requires the
immediate delivery ofalarge quantity ofgrapefruit.” Hepaused,
thenadded, ‘The Director ofUnification issolejudge ofthepublic
welfare andhassole authority over theallocation ofanymotive
power and rolling stock onanyrailroad anywhere intheUnited
States.”
There wasamoment ofsilence. “Isee,” shesaid. Inanother mo-
ment, sheasked, “What hasbeendone about theWinston tunnel?”
“Oh, thatwasabandoned threeweeks ago.They never unearthed
thetrains. Theequipment gave out.”
“What hasbeendone about rebuilding theoldlinearound the
tunnel?”
“That wasshelved.”
“Then arewerunning anytranscontinental traffic?”
Hegave heranoddglance. “Oh yes,” hesaid bitterly.
“Through thedetour oftheKansas Western?”
“No.”
“Eddie, what hasbeen happening here inthepastmonth?”
Hesmiled as ithiswords were anuglyconfession “We’ve been

Shesawtheouter dooropenandJanies Taggart come in,accom-

“No. Iwant tohepresent.”

“No, lhaven’t quit.”

“That’s notwhat 1mean!”
“Well, whatdoyoumean?”
“1mean—”Hestopped, hiseyes avoiding hers. “1mean—”He
sat,searching forwords, cracking hisknuckles.
Jimwasgoing topieces, shethought; thejerky impatience, the
shrillness, theaura ofpanic were new:crude outbreaks ofatoneof
ineffectual menace hadreplaced hispose ofcautious smoothness.
“1mean—” Hewassearching forwords toname hismeaning
without naming it,shethought, tomake herunderstand thatwhich
hedidnotwant tobeunderstood. “1mean, thepublic—”
“Iknow what youmean.” she said.“No, Jim, I’mnotgoing to
reassure thepublic about thestale ofourindustry.”
“Now you’re—”
“The public hadbetter beasunreassured asithasthewits tobe.
Nowproceed tobusiness,”
“I—”
“Proceed tobusiness, Jim.”
Heglanced atMr.Meigs. Mr.Meigs satsilently, hislegscrossed,
smoking acigarette. Hewore ajacket which was not,butlooked
like,amilitary uniform. The flesh ofhisneck bulged over thecollar,
andtheflesh ofhisbody strained against thenarrow waistline in-
tended todisguise it.Hewore aringwith alarge yellow diamond
thatflashed when hemoved hisstubby fingers.
“You’ve metMr.Meigs,” saidTaggart, “I’m soglad thatthetwo
ofyou willgetalong well together.” Hemade anexpectant half-
pause, butreceived noanswer from either. “Mr.Meigs istherepre-

tunities tocooperate withhim."
“What istheRailroad Unification Plan?"
“It isa...anewnational setup thatwent into effect threeweeks
ago,which you willappreciate andapprove ofand findextremely
practical." Shemarveled atthe futility ofhismethod: hewasacting
asif.bynaming heropinion inadvance, hewould make heTunable
toalter it."It isanemergency setup which hassaved thecountry’s
transportation system."
"What istheplan?"
“You realize, ofcourse, theinsuimountable difficulties ofanysort
ofconstruction jobduring thisperiod ofemergency Itis—temporar-
ily—impossible tolavnew track Therefore, thecountry's topprob-
lem istopreserve thetransportation industry asawhole .topreserve

"What istheplan9"
"Asapolicy ofnational survival, therailroads ofthecountry have
been unified intoasingle team, pooling their resources. Alloftheir
gross revenue isturned over totheRailroad PoolBoard inWashing-
ton,which actsastrustee fortheindustry asawhole, anddivides
thetotalincome among thevarious railroads, according toa . .a
moremodern principle ofdistribution'*
"What principle?"
“Now don’t worry, property rights havebeen fullypreserved and
protected, they've merely been given anew form. Hvery railroad
retains independent responsibility for itsown operations, itstrain
schedules andthemaintenance ofitstrack andequipment. As its
contribution tothenational pool, every railroad permits anyother,
when conditions sorequire, touse itstrack and facilities without
charge. Attheendoftheyear, thePoolBoard distributes thetotal
gross income, andevery individual railroad ispaid, notonthehap-
hazard, old-fashioned basis ofthenumber oftrains runorthetonnage
offreight carried, butonthebasis olitsneed—that is,thepreserva-
tionofitstrack being itsmam need, every individual railroad ispaid
according tothemileage ofthetrack which itowns andmaintains."
Sheheard thewords; sheunderstood themeaning; shewasunable
tomake itreal—togrant therespect ofanger, concern, opposition
toanightmare piece ofinsanity thatrested onnothing butpeople’s
willingness topretend tobelieve that itwassane She feltanumbed
emptiness—andthesense ofbeing thrown farbelow therealm where
moral indignation ispertinent
“Whose track areweusing forourtranscontinental traffic?" she
asked, hervoice flatanddry.
“Why, ourown, ofcourse," saidTagg«u nastily, “that is,from
NewYork toBedford, Illinois. Werunou£trains outofBedford on
thetrack oftheAtlantic Southern."
“ToSanFrancisco?"
“Well, it’smuch faster than that long detour you tried to
establish."

“We runourtrains without charge fortheuseofthetrack?”
“Besides, your detour couldn’t have lasted, theKansas Western
railwasshot,andbesides—”
“Without charge fortheuseoftheAtlantic Southern track?”
“Well, we’re notcharging them fortheuseofourMississippi
bridge, either.”
Alter amoment, sheasked, “Have youlooked atamap?”
“Sure,” saidMeigs unexpectedly. “Youownthehugest track mile-
ageotanyrailroad inthecountry. Soyou’ve gotnothing toworry
about.”
Eddie Willers burst outlaughing.
Meigs glanced athimblankly. “What's thematter withyou?" he
asked,
“Nothing,” saidEddie wearily, “nothing."
“Mr. Meigs,” shesaid, “ifyoulook atamap, you willseethat
two-thirds ofthecostofmaintaining atrack forourtranscontinental
traffic isgiven tousfreeand ispaidbyourcompetitor.”
“Why, sure,” hesaid, buthiseyesnarrowed, watching hersuspi-
ciously. as ilhewere wondering what motive prompted hertoso
explicit astatement.
“While we’re paid forowning miles ofuseless trackwhich carries
notraffic,” shesaid.
Meigs understood- -and leaned back asifhehad lost allfurther
interest inthediscussion
“That's nottrue!” snapped Taggart “We rerunning agreatnum-
beroflix«il trains toserve theregion ofourformer transcontinental
line-through Iowa, Nebraska andColorado —and,ontheother side
otthetunnel, through California, Nevada andUtah.”
“We’re running twolocals aday,' saidEddie Willers, inthedry.
blankly innocent tone ofabusiness report. “Fewer, some places.”
“What determines (henumber oftrains which anygiven railroad
isobligated torun?” sheasked.
“The public welfare,” saidTaggart.
“The PoolBoard,” saidEddie.
“How many trains havebeen discontinued inthecountry inthe
pastthree weeks?”
“Asamatter offact.” said Taggart eagerly, “the plan hashelped
toharmonize theindustry and toeliminate cutthroat competition,”
“Ithaseliminated thirty percentofthetrains runinthecountry*”
saidEddie. “The onlycompetition left isintheapplications tothe
Board lorpermission tocancel trains. The railroad tosurvive w\|l
betheonethatmanages torunnotrains atall.”
“Has anybody calculated howlong theAtlantic Southern isex-
pected tobeable toremain inbusiness?”
“That’s noskin offyour—”started Meigs.
“Please,Cuffy!” cried Taggart.
“The president oftheAtlantic Southern,” saidEddie impassively,
“hascommitted suicide.”
“That hadnothing todowith this!” yelled Taggart. “Itwasover
apersonal matter!”
Sheremained silent. She sat,looking attheir faces. There was still
771
anclement ofwonder inthenumbed indifference ofhermind: Jim
hadalways managed toswitch theweight ofhisfailures upon the
strongest plants around himand tosurvive bydestroying them to
payforhiserrors, ashehaddone withDanConway, ashehad
done withtheindustries ofColorado; butthisdidnothaveeven the
rationality otalooter— thispouncing upon thedrained carcass ofa
weaker, ahalf-bankrupt competitor foramoment's delay, with noth-
ingbutacracking bone between thepouncer andtheabyss.
Theimpulse ofthehabit ofreason almost pushed hertospeak,
toargue, todemonstrate theself-evident— butshelooked attheir
faces andshesaw thattheyknew it.Insome terms different from
hers, insome inconceivable manner ofconsciousness, theyknew all
thatshecould tellthem, itwasuseless toprove tothem theirrational
horror oftheir course andofitsconsequences, bothMeigs and Tag-
gartknew it—andthesecret oltheir consciousness wasthemeans
bywhich theyescaped thefinality oftheir knowledge.
“Isee,” shesaid quietly.
“Well, whatwould yourather havehadmedo?” screamed Tag-
gart.“Give upourtranscontinental traffic? Gobankrupt? Turn the
railroad tnto amiserable EastCoast local?” Hertwowords seemed
tohave hithimworse thananyindignant objection; heseemed to
beshaking with terror atthatwhich thequiet “Isee”hadacknowl-
edged seeing. “Icouldn’t help it!Wehadtohave atranscontinental
track! There wasnowaytogetaround thetunnel!Wehadnomoney
topayforanyextra costs! Something had tobedone!Wehad to
have atrack*”
Meigs waslooking athim with aglance otpart-astonishment,
part-disgust.
“Iamnotarguing, Jim,” shesaid dryly.
“We couldn’t permit arailroad likeTaggart Transcontinental to
crash! Itwould havebeen anational catastrophe! Wehadtothink
ofallthecities andindustries andshippers andpassengers andem-
ployees andstockholders whose livesdepend onus! ftwasn’t just

theRailroad Unification Plan ispractical! Thebest-informed—”
“Jim,” shesaid, “ifyouhaveanyfurther business todiscuss with
me—discuss it.”
“You’ve never considered thesocial angle ofanything,” hesaid,
inasullen, retreating voice.
Shenoticed that thisform ofpretense wasasunreal toMr,Meigs
asitwastoher,though foranantipodal reason. Hewaslooking at
Jimwithbored contempt. Jimappeared tohersuddenly asaman
whohad tried tofindamiddle course between twopoles—Meigs
andherself—andwhowasnowseeing th^t hiscourse wasnarrowing
andthathewastobeground between twostraight walls.
“Mr. Meigs,” sheasked, prompted byhtouch ofbitterly arriused
curiosity, “what isyoureconomic plan fqrdayaftertomorrow?”
Shesawhisbleary brown eyes focusupon herwithout expression.
“YouYe impractical,” hesaid.
”It*s perfectly useless totheorize about thefuture,” snapped Tag-

gart,"when wehave totake careoftheemergency ofthemoment.
Inthelongrun—"
"Inthelong run, we’ll allbedead," saidMeigs.
Then, abruptly, heshot tohisfeet. "Illrunalong, Jim," hesaid.
“I’ve gotnotime towaste onconversations." Headded, "You talk
toherabout thatmatter ofdoing something tostop allthose train
wrecks— ifshe’s the little girlwho’s such awizard atrailroading." It
wassaid inoffensively; hewasamanwhowould notknowwhen he
wasgiving offense ortaking it.
“I’llsecyou later, Ouffy." saidTaggart, asMeigs walked outwith
noparting glance atanyofthem.
Taggart looked ather,expectantly and fearfully, asifdreading her
comment, yetdesperately hoping tohearsome woid, anyword.
"Well?” sheasked.
"What doyoumean?"
"Have youanything else todiscuss?"
"Well, I . .Hesounded disappointed. "Yes!" hecried, inthe

said, “Mrs. Reardon toseeyou,Miss Taggart.”
“Mr.Rearden?” sheasked incredulously, unable tobelieve cither.
“No. Mrs.Rearden.”
She letamoment pass, then said, “Please askhertocome in.”
There wassome peculiar touch ofemphasis inLillian Rearden’s
bearing when sheentered andwalked toward thedesk. Shewore a
tailored suit,with aloose, bright bowhanging casualty sidewise for
anote ofelegant incongruity, andasmall hat tilted atanangle
considered smart byvirtue ofbeing considered amusing; herface
wasashade toosmooth, hersteps ashade tooslow,andshewalked
almost asifshewere swinging herhips,
“How doyoudo.MissTaggart,” shesaid inala/tly gracious voice,
adrawing-room voice which seemed tostrike, inthat office, thesame
style ofincongruity asher suitandherbow.
Dagny inclined herhead gravely.
Lillian glanced about theoffice, herglance hadthesame style of
amusement asherhat:anamusement purporting toexpress maturity
bytheconviction that lifecould benothing butridiculous.
“Please sitdown,” saidDagnv.
Lillian satdown, relaxing intoaconfident, gracefully casual pos-
ture.When sheturned herface toDagny, theamusement was still
there, but itsshading wasnow different, itseemed tosuggest that
they shared asecret, which would make herpresence hereseem
preposterous totheworld, but sellevidently logical tothetwoof
them. Shestressed itbyremaining silent.
“What can 1doforyou7”
"Icame totellyou,” said Lillian pleasantly, "that you willappear
onBertram Scudder’s bioadcast tonight.”
Shedetected noastonishment inDagnys lace,noshock, only the
glance ofanengineer studying amotor thatmakes anincgular
sound. “Iassume,” saidDagny, “that youare fullyaware ofthe
form ofyour sentence.”
“Oh yes!” said Lillian.
“Then proceed tosupport it.”
“Ibegyourpardon?”
“Proceed totellme.”
Lillian gave abrief little laugh, itsfonued brevity betraying that
thiswasnotquite theattitude shehadexpected. “1amsure thatno
lengthy explanation willbenecessary,” she said.“You know why

“Iamnotoneofthose few, asyet,” saidDagny.
Lillian smiled. “Well, yes, 1must explain alittle further. You real-

“Ididn't know that,” saidDagny sharply.
“Oh, ofcourse, youhave beenaway formost ofthe lasttwo

press, ontheradio, inpublic speeches—thatevenHank Rcardcn

signed hisMetal over tothenation. EvenHank Rearden That dis-
courages agreatmany recalcitrants andhelps tokeepthem inline.”
Sheleaned backandasked inthetone ofacasual aside,“Have you
everasked himwhyhesigned?”
Dagny didnotanswer: shedidnotseem tohear that itwasa
question: she sat stillandherlacewasexpressionless, buthereyes

nmv intent upon nothing buthearing Lillian totheend.
“No. Ididn’t think youknew' it. Ididn’t think thathewould

signposts and sliding comfortably down theanticipated course “Yet
youmust learn thereason thatmade himsign— -because itisthe
same reason that willmake youappear onBertram Scudder’s broad-
casttonight.”
Shepaused, wishing tobeurged. Dagny waited.
“It isareason,” said Lillian, “which should pleaseyou— asfaras

Lillian’s voice hadkeptgrowing reluctantly sharper, likeadrill-
head thatkeptbreaking bybeing unable tofindthelineofthefault
inthestone. Dagny was stilllooking ather,buttheintensity had
vanished fromDagny ’seyesandposture. Lillian wondered whyshe
feltas ilDagny ’sfacewere hitbyaspotlight. Shecould detect no
particular expression, itwassimply aface innatural repose- -and the
clarity seemed tocome from itsstructure, from theprecision ofits
sharp planes, thefirmness ofthemouth, thesteadiness oftheeyes.
Shecould notdecipher theexpression oftheeyes, itseemed incon-
gruous, ifresembled thecalm, notofawoman, butofascholar,
ithad that peculiar, luminous quality which isthetearlessness ot
satisfied knowledge.
‘itwas I,"said Lillian softly, “who informed thebureaucrats about
myhusband’s adultery.”
Dagny noticed the first flicker otfeelingmLillian’s lifeless eyes:
itresembled pleasure, butsodistantly that itlooked like sunlight
reflected from thedead surface ofthemoon tothestagnant water
ofaswamp; ilflickered foraninstant andwent.
“Itwas 1,”said Lillian, “who took Reardcn Metal away from

Itwasnotwithin thepower ofDagny ’sconsciousness ever toun-
derstand thatpleaortoknow what response Lillian hadhoped to

sudden shrillness ofLillian's voice. “Have youunderstood me?"
“Yes.”
“Then youknow what Idemand andwhy you'll obey me.You

There wasabeam ofwhite light beating down upon theglittering
metal ofamicrophone— inthecenter ofaglass cage imprisoning
herwithBertram Scudder. Thesparks ofglitter were greenish-blue;
themicrophone wasmade ofRearden Metal.
Above them, beyond asheet ofglass, shecould distinguish abooth

“—thelastdescendant ofanillustrious name inourindustrial his-
tory, thewoman executive possible only inAmerica, theOperating
Vice-President ofagreat railroad—MissDagny Taggart!”
Then she feltthetouch ofRearden Metal, asherhand closed over
thestem ofthemicrophone, and itwassuddenly easy, notwith the
drugged ease ofindifference, butwith thebright, dear, living ease
ofaction.
"Icame here totellyouabout thesocial program, thepolitical
system andthemoral philosophy under which youarenow living.”
There wassocalm, sonatural, sototal acertainly inthesound of
hervoice that themere sound seemed tocarry animmense per-
suasiveness.
"You haveheard itsaid that Ibehove that thissystem hasdeprav-

Bertram Scudder wasstaring ather; thiswasnotthespeech he
hadexpected andhefelt, indunpanic, that itwasnotproper tolet
itcontinue, butshewas thespecial guestwhom theWashington
rulers hadordered him totreat cautiously; hecould notbecertain
whether hewasnowsupposed tointerrupt herornot: besides, he
enjoyed hearing this sortofstory. Intheaudience booth, James
Taggart and Lillian Rearden salfrozen, likeanimals paralyzed by
theheadlight ofatrain rushing down upon them; theywere theonly
ones present whoknew theconnection between thewords theywere
hearing andthetheme ofthebroadcast; itwastoolateforthem to

ofChick Morrison’s staff stood ready tocutthebroadcast offthe

speech hewashearing, noelement hecould construe asdangerous
tohismasters Hewasaccustomed tohearing speeches extorted by
unknown pressure from unwilling victims, andheconcluded that this
wasthecase ofareactionary forced toconfess ascandal and that,
therefore, thespeech had,perhaps, some political value; besides, he
wascurious tohear it
“Iamproud thathehadchosen metogivehimpleasure andthat

Intheinstant when Scudder’s hand swept outtoknock themicro-
phone over, afaint clickcame from itsthroat as itclashed tothe
floor, signifying that theintellectual cophad cutthebroadcast off
the air.
Shelaughed—butthere wasnoonetoseeherand tohear the
nature ofherlaughter. Thefigures rushing intotheglass enclosure
were screaming atoneanothei. Chick Morrison wasyelling unprint-
ablecurses atBertram Scudder—Bertram Scudder wasshouting that

theprogram announcer wascrying, pointing atthemicrophone. “Mr.

answered him.They were notlighting overwhat todo,butover

Nobody said aword toDagny orglanced inherdirection. Nobody
stopped her,when shewalked out.
Shestepped into the firsttaxicab insight, giving theaddress of

brief, tense coughs ofstatic: itwastuned toBertram Scudder's

She layback against theseat, feeling nothing butthedesolation
oftheknowledge thatthesweep ofhe*action had,perhaps, swept
away themanwhomight never wish t<|seeheragain. She felt, for
the firsttime, theimmensity ofthehopelessness offinding him—il

sound ofhisvoice saying toher:“Nobody stays herebyfaking reality

“Ladies andgentlemen." thevoice ofBertram Scudder’s an-
nouncer crackled suddenly outofthe static, “due totechnical diffi-
culties overwhich wehavenocontrol, thisstation willremain off
the air,pending thenecessary readjustments." The taxidriver gave
abrief, contemptuous chuckle—andsnapped theradio off.
When shestepped outandhanded himabill,heextended the

Chapter IVANTI-LIFE
lames Taggart reached intothepocket ofhisdinner jacket, pulled
outthe firstwad otpaper hefound, which wasahundred-dollar bill,
anddropped itintothebeggar’s hand.
Henoticed that thebeggar pocketed themoneymamanner as
indifferent ashisown. “Thanks, bud.” said thebeggar contemptu-
ously, andwalked away
James Taggart remained still inthemiddle otthesidewalk, won-
dering what gavehim asense ofshock anddread. Itwasnotthe
man’s insolence—hehadnotsought anygratitude, hehadnotbeen
moved bypity, hisgesture hadbeen automatic andmeaningless. It
was thatthebeggar acted asifhewould havebeen indifferent had
heleceived ahundred dollars oradime or,failing tofindanyhelp
whatever, hehadseen himself dying ofstarvation within thisnight.
laggaTt shuddered andwalked brusquely on,theshudder serving to
cutofftherealization thatthebeggar's mood matched hisown.
The walls ofthestreet aiound himhadthestressed, unnatural
clarity ofasummer twilight, while anorange haze filled thechannels
ofintersections andveiled thetiers otroofs, leaving himonashrink-
ingremnant ofground. Thecalendar intheskyseemed tostand
insistently outotthehaze, yellow like apage ofoldparchment,
saying: August 5.
No—hethought, inanswers tothings hehadnotnamed—itwas
nottrue,hefelt line, that'swhyhewanted todosomething tonight.
Hecould notadmit tohimself that hispeculiar restlessness came
from adesire toexperience pleasure; hecould notadmit that the
particulai pleasure hewanted was that otcelebration, because he
could notadmit what itwasthathewanted tocelebrate.
Thishadbeen adayofintense activity, spent onwords floating
asvaguely ascotton* yetachieving apurpose asprecisely asanadd-
ingmachine, summing uptohisfullsatisfaction. But hispurpose and
thenature ofhissatisfaction hadtobekept ascarefully hidden from
himself astheyhadbeen from others; and hissudden craving for
pleasure wasadangerous breach.
Thedayhadstarted with asmall luncheon inthehotel suite ofa
visiting Argentinian legislator, where afewpeople ofvarious nation-
alities hadtalked atleisurely length about theclimate ofArgentina,
itssoil, itsresources, theneeds ofitspeople, thevalue ofadynamic,
progressive attitude toward thefuture—andhadmentioned, asthe
briefest topic ofconversation, thatArgentina would bedeclared a
People’s State within twoweeks.
791
Ithadbeen followed byafewcocktails atthehome ofOrren
Boyle, with onlyoneunobtrusive gentleman from Argentina sitting
silently inacorner, while twoexecutives fromWashington andafew
friends ofunspecified positions hadtalked about national resources,
metallurgy, mineralogy, neighborly duties andthewelfare ofthe
globe—andhadmentioned that aloanoffour billion dollars would
begranted within three weeks tothePeople’s State ofArgentina
andthePeople’s State ofChile.
Ithadbeen followed byasmall cocktail party inaprivate room
ofthebarbuilt likeacellar ontheroofofaskyscraper, aninformal
party given byhim,James Taggart, forthedirectors ofarecently
formed company. TheInterneighborly Amity andDevelopment Cor-
poration. ofwhich Orren Boyle waspresident andaslender, graceful,
overactive manfrom Chile was treasurer, amanwhose name was
Sefior Mario Martinez, butwhom Taggart wastempled, bysome
resemblance ofspirit, tocall Seftor Cuffy Meigs. Here theyhad
talked about golf, horse races, boat races, automobiles andwomen.
Ithadnotbeen necessary tomention, since they allknew it,that
theInterneighborly Amity andDevelopment Corporation hadan
exclusive contract tooperate, onatwenty-year “managerial lease,”
alltheindustrial properties ofthePeople's States oftheSouthern
Hemisphere.
The lastevent ofthedayhadbeen alarge dinner reception atthe
home ofSeftor Rodrigo Gonzales, adiplomatic representative of
Chile.Noonehadheard ofSefior Gon/ales ayear ago.buthehad
become famous fortheparties hehadgiven inthepast sixmonths,
ever since hisarrivalmNew York. Hisguests described him asa
progressive businessman. Hehad lost hisproperty— itwas said—
when Chile, becoming aPeople's State, hadnationalized allproper-
ties,except those belonging tocitizens ofbackward, non-Peoplo’s
countries, such asArgentina; buthehadadopted anenlightening
attitude andhadjoined thenewregime, placing himself intheservice
ofhiscountry. Hishome inNewYork occupied anentire lloor of
anexclusive residential hotel Hehad afat,blank faceandtheeyes
ofakiller. Watching him attonight's reception, Taggart hadcon-
cluded thatthemanwasimpervious toanysorfoffeeling, helooked
asifaknife could slash, unnoticed, through hispendulous layers of
flesh— except thatthere wasalewd, almost sexual relish inthewav
herubbed hisfeetagainst therich pileofhisPersian rugs, orpatted
thepolished armofhischair, orfolded hislipsabout acigar. His
wife, theSefiora Gonzales, was asmall, attractive woman, notas
beautiful assheassumed, butenjoying thereputation ofabeauty by
means ofaviolent nervous energy andanoddmanner ofloose,
warm, cynical self-assertiveness thatsee&ied topromise anything and
toabsolve anyone. Itwasknown thath^rparticular brand oftrading
washerhusband’s chief asset, inanage^when onetraded, notgoods,
butfavors— and,watching heramong t%cguests, Taggart hadfound
amusement inwondering what dealsha4beenmade, what directives
issued, what industries destroyed inexchange forafewchance nights,
which most ofthosemenhadhadnoreason toseek and, perhaps,
could nolonger remember. Theparty hadbored him, therehadbeen
792
only halfadozen persons forwhose sakehehadputinanappear-
ance, and ithadnotbeen necessary tospeak tothat half-dozen,
merely tobeseenandtoexchange afewglances. Dinner hadbeen
about tobeserved; when hehadheard what hehadcome tohear:
Seflor Gonzales hadmentioned—thesmoke ofhiscigarweaving over
thehalf-dozen menwhohad drifted toward hisarmchair- -that by
agreement with thefuture People’s State ofArgentina, theproperties
ofd’Anconia Copper would benationalized bythePeople’s State of
Chile, inlessthan amonth, onSeptember 2.
Ithad allgone asTaggart hadexpected; theunexpected hadcome
when, onhearing those words, hehad feltanirresistible urge to
escape. Hehad feltincapable ofenduring theboredom otthedinner,
asifsome other form ofactivity wereneeded togreet theachieve-
ment ofthis night.Hehadwalked outinto thesummer twilight of
thestreets, feeling asifhewere bothpursuing andpursued: pursuing
apleasure which nothing could givehim, incelebration otafeeling
which hedared notname—pursued bythedread ofdiscovering what
motive hadmoved himthrough theplanning oftonight’s achieve-
ment andwhat aspect of itnowgavehim thisfeverish sense of
gratification.
Hereminded himself thathewould sell hisd’Anconia Copper
stock, which hadnever rallied fully after itscrash otlastyear,and
hewould purchase shares oftheInlerneighboily Amity andDevelop-
ment Corporation, asagreed with hisfriends, which would bring him
afortune. Butthethought brought himnothing butboredom; this
wasnotthething hewanted tocelebrate.
Hetried toforce himself toenjoy it:money, hethought, hadbeen
hismotive, money, nothing worse. Wasn’t that anormal motive? A
validone? Wasn’t thatwhat they allwere after, theWyatts, the
Reardens, thed’Anconias? .. ,Hejerked hishead tostop it;hefelt
asifhisthoughts were slipping down adangerous blind alley, the
endofwhich hemust never permit himself tosee.
No—hethought bleakly, inreluctant admission—money meant
nothing tohimany longer. Hehadthrown dollars about bythe
hundreds—atthatparly hehadgiven today—forunfinished drinks,
foruneaten delicacies, forunprovoked tipsandunexpected whims,
toralong-distance phone calltoArgentina because oneoftheguests
hadwanted tocheck theexact version ofasmutty story hehad
started telling, forthespur ofanymoment, fortheclammy stupor
ofknowing that itwaseasier topaythan tothink.
“You've gotnothing toworry about, under thatRailroad Unifica-
tionPlan,” Orren Boyle hadgiggled tohimdrunkenlv. Under the
Railroad Unification Plan, alocal railroad hadgone bankrupt in
North Dakota, abandoning theregion tothefateofablighted area,
thelocal banker hadcommitted suicide, first killing hiswifeand
children—a freight trainhadbeen taken offtheschedule inTennes-
see,leaving alocal tactory without transportation ataday’s notice,
thefactory owner’s sonhadquitcollege andwasnowmjail,awaiting
execution foramurder committed with agang ofratders—a way
station hadbeen closed inKansas, andthestation agent,whohad
wanted tobeascientist, hadgiven uphisstudies andbecome a
793
dishwasher— that he,James Taggart, might sitinaprivate barroom
andpayforthealcohol pouring down Orren Boyle’s throat, forthe
waiter whosponged Boyle’s garments when hespilled hisdrink over
hischest, forthecarpet burned bythecigarettes ofanex-pimp from
Chilewhodidnotwant totakethetrouble ofreaching foranashtray
across adistance ofthree feet.
Itwasnottheknowledge olhisindifference tomoney thatnow
gavehimashudder ofdread. Itwastheknowledge thathewould
beequally indifferent, were hereduced tothestate ofthebeggar.
There hadbeen atimewhen hehad feltsome measure ofguilt—in
noclearer aform than atouch ofirritation—atthethought thathe
shared thesinofgreed, which hespent histimedenouncing. Now
hewas hitbythe chill realization that, infact,hehadnever been a
hypocrite- mfull truth, hehadnever cared formoney Hus left
another hole gaping open before him, leading intoanother blind
alley which hecould notriskseeing.
Ijustwant todosomething tonight!—hecried soundlessly to
someone atlarge, inprotest and indemanding anger— inprotest
against whatever itwas that keptlorcmg these thoughts into his
mind—inanger atauniverse where some malevolent power would
notpermit him tofindenjoyment without theneed toknow what
hewanted orwhy.
What doyouwant? --some enemy voice kept asking, andhe
walked faster, trying toescape it.Itseemed tohim that hisbrain
wasamaze where ablind alleyopened atevery turn, leading into
afogthathidanabyss. Itseemed tohim thathewasrunning, while
thesmall island ofsafety wasshrinking andnothing butthose alleys
would soon beleft Itwas liketheremnant ofclarity inthestieet
around him, with thehaze rolling into fillallexits.Why did ithave
toshrink?—hethought inpanic. Thiswasthewayhehadlived allhis
life—keeping hiseyes stubbornly, safely ontheimmediate pavement
before him, craftily avoiding thesight olhisroad, ofcorners, of
distances, ofpinnacles. Hehadnever intended going anywhere, he
hadwanted tobefreeofprogression, freeoftheyoke ofastraight
line,hehadnever wanted hisyears toadduptoanysum—what
hadsummed them up?—whyhadhereached some unchosen destina-
tionwhere onecould nolonger stand stillorretreat? ‘‘Look where
you’re going, brother!” snarled some voice, while anelbow pushed
himback—andherealized thathehadcollided withsome large, ill-
smelling figure andthathehadbeen running.
Heslowed hissteps andadmitted into hismind arecognition of
thestreets hehadchosen inhisrandom escape. Hehadnotwanted
toknow thathewasgoinghome tohi^wife. That, too,wasafog-
bound alley, butthere wasnoother lefttohim.
Heknew—themoment hesawCherryl’s silent, poised figure as
sherose athisentrance intoherroom—Jhat thiswasmore dangerous
thanhehadallowed himself toknow and thathewould notfind
what hewanted. Butdanger, tohim,was asignal toshut offhis
sight, suspend hisjudgment andpursue anunaltered course, onthe
unstated premise thatthedanger would remain unreal bythesover-
794
eignpower ofhiswish nottosee it—likeafoghorn within him,
blowing, nottosound awarning, buttosummon thefog.
"Why. yes, Ididhave animportant business banquet toattend,
but Ichanged mymind, Ifeltlikehaving dinner withyoutonight,”
hesaid inthetone ofacompliment —butaquiet "fsee”wasthe

"What deal,Jim?"
"What doyoumean, what deal?Why areyoususpicious? Why
doyouhave tostart prying atonce?"
"I’m sorry. Ididn't know itwasconfidential You don't have to

"It'snotconfidential." Hewaited, butsheremained silent. "Well?

“Why, no."Shesaid itsimply, asiftoplease him.
“Soyou’re notinterested atall?"
"But Ithought youdidn’t want todiscuss it."
“Oh, don’t besotricky!" hesnapped. "It's abigbusiness deal.

anything those boys everdreamed of.They spend their lives grub-

hesnapped hisfingers—“just like that. It’sthebiggest single stunt

"Stunt, Jim?"
“Deal!"
“And youdid it?Yourself?"

“Champagne?"
“Can’t wedosomething special tonight? Can’twehave asortof

“We canhavechampagne, yes,Jim,ofcourse.”

“Whose property?"
“Why . . .thepeople's. This isnotanold-fashioned grab lor

“Itdepends.”
“Ithink I’llendupasoneoftherichest men intheworld,” he

“No.”

“Idon’t want anything, Jim.”
“But you’ve got to'You’ve gottowant something, damn you!”
Shelooked athim, faintly startled, butotherwise indifferent.
“Oh, allright. I’msorry,” hesaid; heseemed astonished byhis
ownoutbreak. “Ijustwanted toplease you.” headded sullenly, “but

“I'm trying tofindout,” shesaid slowly.
“Doyou still think, asyouused to,thatHank Rcarden isa

“Yes, Jim, 1do.”
“Well. I’vegothimbeaten. I’mgreater thananvofthem, greater
thanRearden andgreater than thatother lover ofmysister’s, who—-”
Hestopped, asifhehad slidtoo fai.
“Jim”sheasked evenly, “what's going tohappen onSeptember
second?”
Heglanced upathei.from under hisforehead—acold glance,
with hismuscles creased intoasemi-smile, asdincynical breach of
some hallowed restraint: “They’re going tonationalize d’Ancon ia
Copper.” hesaid.
Heheard thelong, harsh rollofamotor, asaplane went by

piece oficesettled melting, inthesilver bowl ofhisfruitcup— before
sheanswered. She said,“Hewasyour fiicnd. wasn’t he?”
“Oh, shutup'”
Heremained silent, notlooking atherWhen hiseyescame back
toherface, shewas stillwatching him aridshespoke first,hervoice
oddly stern:“What youi sister didinherradio broadcast wasgreat.”
“Yes, Jknow. 1know, you’ve been saying that foramonth,”
“You’ve never answered me.”
“What isthere toans . .?”
“Just asyour friends inWashington have never answered her.”
797
Heremained silent. “Jim,Pmnotdropping thesubject.*’ Hedidnot
answer. “Your friends inWashington never uttered aword about it.
They didnotdeny thethings shesaid, theydidnotexplain, theydid
nn»trytojustify themselves. They acted asifshehadnever spoken.
Ithink they’re hoping thatpeople willforget it.Some people will.
Buttherestofusknow what shesaidand thatyour friends were
afraid tofight her.”
“That’s nottrue!Theproper action wastaken andtheincident is
closed and 1don’t seewhyyoukeep bringing itup.”
“What action?”
“Bertram Scudder wastaken oftthe air,asaprogram notinthe
public interest atthepresent time.”
“Does thatanswer her?”
“Itdosed theissueandthere's nothing more tobesaidabout it.”
“About agovernment thatworks byblackmail andextortion?”
“You can’t saythat nothing wasdone. It’sbeen publicly an-
nounced thatScudder’s programs were disruptive, destructive and
untrustworthy.”
“Jim, fwant tounderstand this.Scudder wasn’t onherside— he
wasonyours.Hedidn’t even arrange thatbroadcast. Hewasacting
onorders from Washington, wasn’t he?”
“1thought youdidn't likeBertram Scudder.”
“Ididn’t and Idon’t, but—”
“Then whatdoyoucare?”
“But hewasinnocent, asfarasyour friends were concerned,
wasn’t he?”
“1wishyouwouldn't bother with polities. You talk likeafool”
“Hewasinnocent, wasn’t he?”
“Sowhat?”
Shelooked athim, hereyes incredulously wide. “Then they just
made himthescapegoat, didn’t they?”
“Oh, don’t sitthere looking likeEddie Willers!”
“Do I? IlikeEddie Willers. He's honest.”
“He’s adamn half-wit whodoesn’t have thefaintest ideaofhow'
todealwith practical reality!”
“Butyoudo,don’t you,Jim?”
“You bet Ido!”
“Then couldn’t youhave helped Scudder?”
“/?”Heburst into helpless, angry laughter. “Oh,whydon’t you
grow up? Ididmybest togetScudder thrown tothelions! Some-
body hadtobe.Don’t youknow that itwasmyneck, ifsome other
hadn’t beenfound?”
“Your neck?Why notDagny’s, itsficwaswrong? Because she
wasn’t?”r
“Dagny isanentirely different category! Ithad tobeScuddei
orme.”
“Why?”
“And it’smuch better fornational pdlicy tolet itbeScudder. This
way, it’snotnecessary toargue about \tfhat shesaid—and ifanybody
brings itup,westarthowling that itw£ssaidonScudder’s program

“Why notDagny? Because herspeech could notbediscredited?”
“Ifyou’re sodamn sorry forBertram Scudder, youshould have
seenhim tryhisdamndest tomake them breakmyneck! He'sbeen
doing that foryears—howdoyouthink he’gottowhere hewas,
except byclimbing oncarcasses? Hethought hewaspretty powerful,
too—youshould have seenhowthebigbusiness tycoons used tobe
afraid ofhim! Buthegothimself outmaneuvered, this time. This
time* hebelonged tothewrong faction.”
Dimly, thtough thepleasant stupor ofrelaxing, ofsprawling back
inhischair and smiling, heknew that thiswas theenjoyment he
wanted, tobehimself lobehimself— hethought, inthedrugged,
precarious state offloating past thedeadliest ofhisblind alleys, the
onethat ledtothequestion ofwhat washimself.
“You see,hebelonged totheTinky Holloway faction. Itwas
prelty much ofaseesaw forawhile, between theTinky Holloway
faction andtheCluck Morrison faction. ButwewonTinky made a
dealandagreed toscuttle hispalBertram inexchange forafew
things heneeded from us.You should have heard Bertram howl!
Buthewasadeadduckand lieknew it”
Hestarted onarolling chuckle, butchoked itoff,asthehaze
cleai oilandhesaw luswife's face. "'Jim.” shewhispered, “isthat
thesort of ..victories you’re winning?”
“Oh, forChrist's sake!” hescreamed, smashing his fistdown on
thetable.“Where haveyoubeen allthese years? What sortofworld
doyouthink you're living in?” Hisblow hadupset hiswater glass
andthewater went spreading indark stains over thelace ofthe
tablecloth.
“I'm trying tofindout,” shewhispered Hershoulders were sag-
gingandherfacelooked suddenly worn, anodd,aged look that
seemed haggard and lost.
“1couldn’t help it!”heburst outmthesilence. “I’m nottoblame!
Ihave tolake things as 1findthem! It’snot lwho've made this
world!”
Hewasshocked toseethat shesmiled— asmile ofsofiercely
bitter acontempt that itseemed incredible onhergently patient
face; shewasnotlooking athim. but atsome image ofherown.
“That's whatmyfather used losaywhen hegotdrunk atthecorner
saloon instead oflooking forwork,”
“How dareyou trycomparing meto—-” hestarted, butdidnot
finish, because shewasnotlistening.
Herwords, when shelooked athimagain, astonished himascom-
pletely irrelevant “The dateofthatnationalization, September sec-
ond,” sheasked, hervoice wistful, “was ityouwhopicked it?”
“No. Ihadnothing todowith it.It’sthedate ofsome special
session oftheir legislature. Why?”
“It’s thedateofour firstwedding anniversary.”
“Oh? Oh, that’s right!” Hesmiled, relieved atthechange toa
799
safesubjeet “We’ll havebeen married ayear.My, itdoesn’t seem
thatlong!”
“Itseems much longer,” shesaid tonelessly.
Shewaslooking offagain, andhefeltinsudden uneasiness that
thesubject wasnotsafe atall;hewished shewould notlook asif
shewere seeing thewhole course ofthatyearandoftheirmarriage
nottogetscared, buttoleant— shethought—thething todoisnot
togetscared, buttolearn .. .Thewords came from asentence she
hadrepeated toherself sooften that itfelt likeapillar polished
smooth bythehelpless weight ofherbody, thepillar thathadsup-
ported herthrough thepast year.She tried torepeat it,butshe fell
asifherhands were slipping onthepolish, asifthesentence would
notstave offterror anylonger—bccau.se shewasbeginning to
understand.
Ifyoudon’t know, thething todoisnottogetscared, butto
learn. ... Itwasmthebewildered loneliness ofthe firstweeks of
hermarriage thatshesaid ittoherself forthe firstlime. Shecould
notunderstand Jim's behavior, orhissullen anger, which looked like
weakness, orhisevasive, incomprehensible answers toherquestions,
which sounded likecowardice; such trails were notpossible inthe
James Taggart whom shehadmarried. She told herself thatshe
could notcondemn without understanding, thatsheknew nothing
about hisworld, that theextent ofherignorance wastheextent to
which shemisinterpreted hisactions. Shetook theblame, shetook
thebeating ofself-reproach —against some bleakly stubborn certainty
which toldherthatsomething waswrong andthatthething she felt
was fear.
“Imust learn everything thaiMrs.James Taggart isexpected to
know andtobe,”wasthewaysheexplained herpurpose toateacher
ofetiquette. She setouttolearn with thedevotion, thediscipline,
thedrive ofamilitary cadet orareligious novice. Itwastheonly
way, shethought, ofearning theheight which herhusband had
granted herontrust, ofliving uptohisvision ofher.which itwas
nowherduty toachieve. And, notwishing toconfess ittoherself
she feltalso that attheendofthelong taskshewould lccapture
hervision ofhim, thatknowledge would bring back tohertheman
shehadseenonthenight ofhisrailroad’s triumph.
Shecould notunderstand Jim's attitude when shetoldhimabout
herlessons. Heburst outlaughing; shewasunable tobelieve that
thelaughter hadasound ofmalicious contempt. “Wh#, Jim?Why?
What areyoulaughing at?”Hewould notexplain—almost as ilthe
factofhiscontempt were suttieient andrequired noreasons.
Shecould notsuspect himofmalice: hpwastoopatiently generous
about hermistakes. Heseemed eager* todisplay her inthebest
drawing rooms ofthecity,andhenevec uttered aword ofreproach
forherignorance, forherawkwardness^ forthose terrible moments
when asilent exchange otglances amofcg theguests andaburst of
blood tohercheekbones toldherthatshehadsaidthewrong thing
again.Heshowed noembarrassment, himerely watched herwith a
faint smile.When theycame home, aft^roneofthose evenings, his
800
mood seemed affectionately cheerful. Hewastrying tomake iteasier
forher,shethought— andgratitude drove hertostudy theharder.
Sheexpected herreward ontheevening when, bysome impercep-
tible transition, shefound herself enjoying aparty forthe firsttime,
She feltfree toact,notbyrules, but atherown pleasure, with
sudden confidence thattheruleshadfused intoanatural habit— she
knew thatshewasattracting attention, butnow, forthe firsttime, it
wasnottheattention ofridicule, butofadmiration— shewassought
after,onherown merit, shewasMrs. Taggait. shehadceased being
anobject ofcharity weighing Jimdown, painfully tolerated forhis
sake— shewaslaughing gaily andseeing thesmiles ofresponse, of
appreciation onthefaces around her—andshekept glancing athim
across theroom, radiantly, likeachild handing him areport card
with aperfect score, begging him tobeproud ofher.Jim satalone
inacorner, watching herwithanundecipherable glance.
Hewould notspeak toherontheirwayhome. “Idon’tknowwhy
1keep dragging myself tothose parties.” hesnapped suddenly, tear-
ingoffhisdress tieinthemiddle oftheir living room. ‘Tve never
satthrough such avulgar, boring waste oftime!” “Why. Jim,” she
said, stunned, “Ithought itwaswonderful.” “You would! You
seemed tobequite athome—quite asifitwereConey Island. Iwish
you'd learn tokeep your place andnottoembarrass meinpublic.”
“Iembarrassed you? Tonight?”“You did!”“How?” “Ifyoudon’t
understand it, Ican’t explain.” hesaid inthetoneofamystic who
implies thatalackofunderstanding istheconfession ofashameful
inferiority. “1don’t understand it,”shesaid firmly. Hewalked out
ofthemom, slamming thedoor.
She feltthat theinexplicable wasnotamere blank, thistime: it
hadatinge ofevil.From that night on,asmall, hard point offear
remained within her, likethespot ofadistant headlight advancing
upon herdown aninvisible track.
Knowledge didnotseem tobring heraclearer vision ofJim’s
world, buttomake themysteiy greater. Shecould notbelieve that
shewassupposed tofeelrespect forthedreary senselessness oftheart
shows which hisfriends attended, ofthenovels they read, ofthe
political magazines theydiscussed—theartshows, where shesawthe
kind ofdrawings shehadseen chalked onanypavement ofher
childhood’s slums—thenovels, thatpurported toprove the futility
ofscience, industry, civilization and love, using language thather
father would nothave used inhisdrunkenest moments— themaga-
zines, thatpropounded cowardly generalities, lessclear andmore
stale than thesermons forwhich shehadcondemned thepreacher
oftheslum mission asamealy-mouthed oldfraud. Sheaiuld not
believe that these things were theculture shehadsoreverently
looked uptoandsoeagerly waited todiscover. She feltasifshe
hadclimbed amountain toward ajagged shape thathadlooked like
acastle andhadfound ittobethecrumbling ruin ofagutted
warehouse.
“Jim,” shesaidonce, afteranevening spentamong themenwho
were called theintellectual leaders ofthecountry, “Dr.Simon Prit-
chett isaphony—amean, scared oldphony.” “Now, really,” he
801
answered, “doyouthink you’re qualified topassjudgment onphilos-
ophers?’4“I’m qualified topassjudgment onconmen. I’veseen
enough ofthem toknow onewhen Iseehim.”“Now this iswhy I
saythat you’ll never outgrow your background. Ifyouhad,you
would have learned toappreciate Dr.Pritchett’s philosophy." “What
philosophy?” “Ifyoudon’t understand it, lcan’t explain." Shewould
not lethimendtheconversation onthat favorite foimula ofhis.
“Jim.” shesaid, “he’s aphony, heandBalph Eubank andthatwhole
gang oftheirs— and 1think you’ve been taken inbythem.” Instead
oftheanger sheexpected, shesawabrief flash ofamusement inthe
liftofhiseyelids. “That’s whatyouthink,” heanswered.
She feltaninstant ofterror atthe firsttouch ofaconcept shehad
notknown tobepossible: What ifJimwasnottaken inbythem?
Shecould understand thephoniness ofDr.Pritchett, shethought —
itwasaracket thatgavehimanundeserved income; shecould even
admit thepossibility, bynow, thatJimmight beaphony inhisown
business; what shecould nothold inside hermind wastheconcept
ofJimasaphony inaracket from which hegained nothing, an
unpaid phony, anunvenal phony; thephoniness ofacardsharp ora
conmanseemed innocently wholesome bycomparison. Shecould
notconceive ofhismotive; she feltonly thattheheadlight moving
upon herhadgrown larger.
Shecould notremember bywhat steps, what accumulation ofpain,
first assmall scratches ofuneasiness, then asstabs ofbewilderment,
then asthechronic, nagging pulloffear, shehadbegun todoubt
Jim’s position ontherailroad. Itwashissudden, angry “soyoudon't
trustme9”snapped inanswer toher first, innocent questions that
made herrealize that shedidnot-—when thedoubt had notyet
formed inhermindandshehad fullyexpected that hisanswers would
reassure her.Shehadlearned, intheslums ofherchildhood, that
honest people were never touchy about thematter ofbeing trusted.
“Idon’t care totalkshop.” was hisanswer whenever shemen-
tioned therailroad. She tried toplead withhimonce. “Jim. you
know what Ithink ofyourwork andhowmuch Iadmire youfor
it.”“Oh, really? What isityoumarried, amanorarailroad presi-
dent?” “I ,..inever thought otseparating thetwo.” “Well, itisnot
very flattering tome.”Shelooked athim, baffled: shehadthought it
was. “I’d liketobelieve,” hesaid, “thatyoulovemeformyself, and
notformyrailroad.” “OhGod, Jim.” shegasped, “you didn't think
that 1—!”“No,” hesaid, with asadly generous smile, “Ididn’t think
thatyoumarried meformymoney ormyposition. /have never
doubted you.” Realizing, instunned copfusion and intortured fair-
ness, thatshemight have given himground tomisinterpret herfeel-
ing,thatshehadforgotten howmany bitter disappointments hemust
have suffered atthehands offortune-h|Linting women, shecould do
nothing butshake herheadandmoan,; “Oh, Jim, that’s notwhat I
meant!” Hechuckled softly, asatachihj, andslipped hisarmaround
her.“Doyouloveme?” heasked. “Ye%” shewhispered. “Then you
musthave faith inme.Love isfaith, youknow. Don’t youseethat
802
Ineed it? Idon’t trustanyone around me, lhave nothing butene-
mies, Iamvery lonely. Don't youknow that Ineed you’?”
Thething thatmade herpace herroom— hours later,mtortured
restlessness— wasthatshewished desperately tobelieve himanddid
notbelieve aword ofit,yetknew that itwas true.
Jtwas true,butnotinthemanner heimplied, notinanymanner
ormeaning shecould everhope tograsp. Itwastrue thatheneeded
her,butthenature ofhisneed kept slipping pastherevery effort to
define itShedidnotknow what hewanted other. Itwasnotflattery
thathewanted, shehadseenhimlistening totheobsequious compli-
ments ofliars, listening with alook olresentful inertness—almost
thelook ofadrug addict atadose inadequate torouse him.But
shehadseenhimtook atherasifhewere waiting forsome reviving

vetaburst otanger was hisanswer, whenever shenamed aleason
foradmiring him.Heseemed towant hertoconsider himgreat, but
never dare ascribe any specific content tohisgreatness.
Shedidnotunderstand thenight, inmid-April, when heretained
from atrip toWashington. “Hi, kid!” hesaid loudly, dropping a
sheaf oflilac intoherarms.“Happy days arehere again! Justsaw
those flowers andthought ofyou.Spring iscoming, baby!”
Hepoured himself adrink andpaced the100m, talking withloo
light, toobrash amanner ofgaiety. There wasafeverish sparkle in
hiseyes, and hisvoice seemed shredded bysome unnatural excite-
ment. Shebegan towonder whether hewaselated orcrushed.
“1know what itisthatthey’re planning!” hesaidsuddenly, with-
outtransition, andsheglanced upathim swiftly: sheknew7thesound
ofoneofhisinner explosions. ‘There's notadozen people inthe
whole country whoknow it,but Ido!Thetopboys arekeeping it

‘Affect —how, Jim?’’
“Itwill affect them!And they don'tknow what’s coming, but I
do.There they sittonight”—hewaved atthelighted windows ofthe
city—“making plans, counting thenmoney, hugging their children
ortheirdreams, andthey don’t know, but Ido,that allof itwillbe
struck, stopped, changed!”
“Changed—fortheworse orthebetter?”
“For thebcttcT, ofcourse,” heanswered impatiently, asifitwere
irrelevant; hisvoiceseemed tolose itsfireandtoslipintothefraudu-
lentsound ofduty. “It’s aplan tosave thecountry, tostopour
economic decline, tohold things still, toachieve stability and
security.”
“What plan?”
“Ican’t tellyou. It’ssecret. Top secret. Youhavenoideahow
many people would liketoknow it.There’s noindustrialist who
wouldn’t giveadozen ofhisbestfurnaces forjustonehintofwarn-
ing,which he’snotgoing toget!LikeHank Rearden, forinstance,
803
whom youadmire somuch.'* Hechuckled, looking offinto the
future.
“Jim.” sheasked, thesound offear inhervoice, telling himwhat
thesound ofhischuckle hadbeen like,“why doyouhateHank
Rearden?”
“Idon't hatehim!” Hewhirled toher,and hisface, incredibly,
looked anxious, almost frightened. “1nevci said 1hated him.Don't
worry, hellapprove oftheplan.Everybody will. It’sforeverybody’s
good.” Hesounded asifhewere pleading. She feltthedizzying
certainty thathewaslying, yetthatthepleawassincere—asifhehad
adesperate need toreassure her,butnotabout thethings hesaid.
Sheforced herself tosmile. “Yes, Jim,ofcourse,” sheanswered,
wondering what instinct inwhat impossible kind ofchaos hadmade
hersay itasifitwere herpart toreassure him.
Thelook shesawonhisfacewasalmost asmile andalmost of
gratitude. “Ihadtotellyouabout ittonight. Ihadtotellyou. I
wanted youtoknow whattremendous issues ldeal with.Youalways

tional scale, affecting everything, controlling everybody. Afewwords
onpaper, adirective—changing the lifeofevery person inevery
nook, cranny andpenthouse ofthiscountry!”
“Yes, Jim,” shesaid, wishing tobelieve thathewas, perhaps, a
man ofstature inthemysterious realm ofWashington.
“You'll see,” hesaid, pacing theroom.“You think they’re power-
ful—those giants ofindustry who ’resoclever withmotors and fur-
naces? They’ll bestopped! They’ll bestripped! They’ll bebrought

“Wehadtohave that plan! With everything falling topieces and

Hiseyeswere desperate; shedidnotknow whether hewasboast-

Hesnapped hisfingers. “Just likebreaking aspine!”
804
“You want tobreak spines?” shewhispered, trembling,
“lhaven’t saidthat!” hescreamed. “What’s thematter withyou?
Ihaven’t said it!”
“I’m sorry, Jim!” shegasped, shocked byherownwords andby

Sheheldonto him,moved bysomething that feltliketenderness

and itseemed toherthat thelook shesaw inhiseyeswas part-
gratification, part-contempt —almost asif.bysomeunknown kindof

Itwasuseless—shefound inthedays thatfollowed— totellheiself
that these things were beyond herunderstanding, that itwasher
duly tobelieve inhim, thatlovewas faith.Herdoubt keptgrowing-
doubt ofhisincomprehensible work and ofhisrelation tothe rail-
load. Shewondered why itkeptgrowing indirect proportion toher
self-admonitions that faithwastheduty sheowed him.Then, one
sleepless night, sherealized thathereffort tofulfill thatduty con-
sisted ofturning awaywhenever people discussed hisjob.ofrefusing
tolook atnewspaper mentions ofTaggart Transcontinental, ofslam-

Shestopped, aghast, struck bythequestion What isit.then— faith
versus truth?And realizing that partofherzeal tobelieve washer
teartoknow, shesetouttolearn thetruth, with acleanei, calmer
sense ofrightness than theeffort asdutiful sell-fraud hadever
given her.
Itdidnottake herlong tolearn Theevasiveness oltheTaggart
executives, when sheasked afewcasual questions, thestale generali-
tiesoltheir answers, thestrain oftheirmanner atthemention of
their boss, and their obvious reluctance todiscuss him—toldher
nothing concrete, butgave herafeeling equivalent toknowing the

President? Well, I’lltellyou* he'sthehoboonthegravy train." “The
boss? Mr.Taggart? Youmean M/av Taggart, don't you?"
ItwasTdche Willers who toldherthewhole truth. Sheheard that
hehadknown Jimsince childhood, andsheasked him tolunch with
her.When shelaced him atthetable, when shesawtheearnest,
questioning directness ofhiseyesandtheseverely literal simplicity
ofhiswoids, shedropped allattempts atcasual prodding, shetold
himwhat shewanted toknow andwhy, briefly, impersonally, not
appealing forhelp orforpity, only fortruth.Heanswered her in
thesame manner. Hetoldherthewhole story, quietly, impersonally,
805
pronouncing noverdict, expressing noopinion, never encroaching
onheremotions byanysignofconcern forthem, speaking withthe
shining austerity andtheawesome power offacts.Hetofdherwho
ranTaggart Transcontinental. Hetoldherthestory oftheJohn Galt
Line. She listened, andwhat she teltwasnotshock, butworse: the
lackofshock, asifshehadalways known it.“Thank you,Mr.Will-

Shewaited forJimtocome home, thatevening, andthething that

“Shut up,yourotten little bitch!”
Shelooked athimblankly, without reaction. Shelooked asifnoth-

Hemade thesound ofasob.“Cherryl, I’msorry. Ididn’t mean

Sheremained standing, leaning against thewall, asshehadstood

Hedropped down ontheedge ofacouch, inaposture ofhelpless
dejection. “How could 1have explained ittoyou?” hosaid inthe
toneofabandoning hope. “Ifs allsobigandsocomplex. How could

“Jim,whydidyoumarry me?"
Hechuckled sadly. “That's what everybody kept asking me. I
didn’t think you'd ever ask it.Why7Because Iloveyou.”
Shewondered athow strange itwas that thisword— which was
supposed tobethesimplest inthehuman language, theword under-
stood by all,theuni\ersal bondamong men—conveyed toherno
meaning whatever Shedidnotknow what itwas that itnamed in
hismind.
“Nobody's ever loved me.” hesaid.“There isn’tunvlovemthe

they care for istime schedules andfreight loads andmoney. Ican’t
liveamong those people. I'mvery lonely. I’\ealways longed tofind

“Jim,” shesaid, withanodd little note ofseverity inhervoice,
“what I'vestruggled for allthistime istounderstand you.”
Hedropped hishand inamotion ofbrushing herwords aside, not
offensively, butsadly, “Ithought youcould. You’re all Ihave. But
maybe understanding isjustnotpossible between human beings.”
“Why should itbeimpossible? Why don’t you tellmewhat itis

Shestood atthewall, without moving.
”1need you,” hewailed softly.‘Tm allalone. You’re notlikethe

Shestood without moving andthedirection ofherglance, lowered
tolookdown athim,wastheonlyform ofrecognition shegave him.
Thethings hesaidabout hissuffering were lies,shethought; butthe
suffering was real;hewas aman tornbysome continual anguish,
which heseemed unable totellher,butwhich, perhaps, shecould
learn tounderstand. She stillowed him thismuch—shethought, with
thegrayness ofasense ofduty—inpayment fortheposition hehad
given her,which, perhaps, was allhehadtogive, sheowed himan
effort tounderstand him.
Itwasstrange tofeel, inthedays that followed, thatshehad
become astranger toherself, astranger whohadnothing towant

But itmade nodifference toheranylonger. Theonewhowasshe.

“Love,” heanswered.
She feltherself sagging with hopelessness, inthefaceofthatan-

“You don't loveme,” hesaid accusingly. Shedidnotanswer.
“You don’t lovemeoryouwouldn’t asksuch aquestion.”
“1didloveyouonce,” shesaid dully, “but itwasn’t what you

But itwasn’t real,anyofit.”
Hislower lipswelled alittle inafaint, contemptuous thrust. “What

“Jim, what isitthatyouwant tobeloved for?”
“What acheap shopkeeper’s attitude!”
Shedidnotspeak; shelooked athim, hereyes stretched bya
silent question.
“Tobeloved fori" hesaid, hisvoice grating withmockery and

“Ofme?” heasked hopefully
“No. notexactly. Nottearofwhatyoucandotome.butofwhat

Hedropped hiseyelids with theswiftness ofslamming adoor—
butshecaught aflash ofhiseyesandtheflash, incredibly, wasterror.
“You’re notcapable oflove,youcheap little gold-digger!” hecried
suddenly, inatone stripped ofallcolor butthedesiie tohurt. “Yes,

Hereyesweredark with thedangerous intensity ofglimpsing her

“Oh, youdon't understand!"
“Yes, Jim, 1do.That’s what youwant—that’s what allofyou

“What doyouthink you're saying?" heasked inatone ofpetty

reflections ofcandles, thewhisper ofbubbles rising through twocrys-

They remained silent, tillthebutler badgone. Taggart satlooking

“Of course,*’ saidDagny gravely. “Come in.”
Shesensed some desperate emergency intheunnatural calm ol
Cherryl’s manner; shebecame certain of itwhen shelooked atthe

Cherryl remained standing.
“Icame topayadebt.” saidCherryl, hervoice solemn with the

“Justice, Cherryl."
Cherryl shuddered suddenly anddropped herhead,“OhGod!"

another shudder, asifthethings shehadtried tocontrol hadbroken

Through theopendoor ofhisstudy. James Taggart hadseenCher-

slammed hisdoorandslumped down onthedavenport, withpatches
ofspilled champagne stillsoaking thecloth ofhistrousers, asifhis
owndiscomfort were arevenge upon hiswifeandupon auniverst:
thatwould notprovide himwith thecelebration hehadwanted.
\fter awhile, heleaped tohisfeet, lore offhiscoalandthrew it
across theroom. Hereached loracigarette, butsnapped itinhalf
andflung itatapainting over thefireplace.
Henoticed avase ofVenetian glass-— amuseum piece, centuries
old,with anintricate system ofblueandgold arteries twisting
through itstransparent bodyHeseized itandHung itatthewall; it
hurst into arain ofglass asthin asashattered light bulb.
Hehadbought that vase forthesatisfaction ofthinking otall
theconnoisseurs whocould notafford it.Now heexperienced the
satisfaction olarevenge upon thecenturies which hadprized it—
andthesatisfaction ofthinking thatthere were millions ofdesperate
Iamities, anyoneofwhom could have lived forayearontheprice
olthat vase.
Hekicked offhisshoes, and fellbackonIhcdavenport, letting
hiss'oeking feetdangle Inmid-air.
Thesound otthedoorbell startled hinr itseemed tomatch his
mood. Itwasthekind ofbrusque, demanding, impatient snap of
^ound hewould haveproduced ithewere now-jabbing hisfinger at
someone’s doorbell.
Helistened lothebutler's steps, promising himself thepleasure
otrefusing admittance towhoever wasseeking it.Inamoment, he
heard theknock athisdoor andthebutler entered toannounce,
‘Mrs.Reardon toseeyou, sir.”
“What? . ..Oh , . .Well!Have hercome in!”
Heswung hisfeetdown tothefloor, butmade noother conces-
sion,andwaited with half asmile ofaleited curiosity, choosing not
toriseuntil amoment after Lillian hadentered theroom.
Shewore awine-colored dinner gown, animitation ofanEmpire
traveling suit,with aminiature double-breasted jacket gripping her
high waistline over thelongsweep ofthe skirt, andasmall hat
817
clinging tooneear,with afeather sweeping down tocurlunder her
chin.Sheentered with abrusque, unrhythmical motion, thetrain of
herdress andthefeather ofherhatswirling, then flapping against
herlegsandthroat, likepennants signaling nervousness.
“Lillian, mydear,am Itobeflattered, delighted orjust plain
flabbergasted?"
“Oh. don’tmake afussabout it! Ihadtoseeyou,and ithad to
beimmediately, that's all.”
Theimpatient tone, theperemptory movement withwhich shesat
down were aconfession ofweakness: bytherules oftheir unwritten
language, onedidnotassume ademanding manner unless onewere
seeking afavor andhadnovalue—nothreat—tobarter.
“Why didn’t youstay attheGun/ales reception?" sheasked, her
casual smile failing tohide thelone ofirritation. “1dropped inon
them after dinner, justtocatch holdofyou-*-but they saidyouhadn’t
been feeling wellandhadgonehome."
Hecrossed theroom andpicked upacigarette, forthepleasure
ofpadding inhisstocking feetpasttheformal elegance hercos-
tume. “Iwasbored," heanswered.
“Ican't stand them." shesaid, with alittleshudder, heglanced at
her inastonishment: thewords sounded involuntary and sincere. “I
can't stand Senor Gon/ales and thatwhore he's gothimself fora
wife. It’sdisgusting that they've become sofashionable, theyand
their parties. Idon't feel likegoing anywhere anylonger. It’snot
thesame style anymore, notthesame spiiit. 1haven’t runinto
Balph Eubank formonths, orDr.Pritchett, oranyoftheboys.And
allthosenew faces thatlook likebutcher’s assistants! After all.our
crowd were gentlemen."
“Yeah," hesaid reflectively. “Yeah, there’s some lunny kind ot
difference. It'slikeontherailroad, too: 1could getalong withHern
Weatherby, hewas civili/ed, butCuffy Meigs—that’s something else
again, that’s ..Hestopped abruptly
“It’s perfectly preposterous." shesaid, inthetone ofachallenge
tothespace atlarge. “They can’t getaway with it."
Shedidnotexplain “who" or“with what." Heknew what she
meant. Through amoment ofsilence, they*looked as iftheywere
clinging toeach other forreassurance.
Inthenextmoment, hewasthinking withpleasurable amusement
that Lillian wasbeginning toshow herage.Thedeepburgundy color
ofhergown wasunbecoming, itseemed todraw apurplish tinge outot
herskin, atinge thatgathered, like twilight, inthesmall gullies of
herface, softening herflesh toatexture oftired slackness, changing hci
lookofbright mockery into alookofstatic malice.
Hesawherstudying him,smiling andspying crisply, with thesmile
aslicense forinsult, “You areunwell, Aren’t you,Jim?You look
likeadisorganized stableboy.";
Hechuckled. "Icanafford it."
“Iknow it,darling. You’re oneofthemost powerful men inNew
York City." Sheadded, “It’s agood jokeonNewYork City."
“Itis.”
“Iconcede thatyou’re inaposition todoanything. That’s why 1
818
hadtoseeyou.” Sheadded asmall, gruntlike sound ofamusement,
todilute herstatement’s frankness,
“Good,” hesaid, hisvoice comfortable andnoncommittal.
“Ihadtocome here, because 1thought itbest, inthisparticular
matter, nottobeseen together inpublic.”
“That isalways wise.”
“Jseem toremember having been useful toyou inthepast.”
“Inthepast—yes.”
“1amsure that 1cancount onyou.”
“Ofcourse—only isn’t thatanold-fashioned, unphilosophical re-
mark?How canweeverbesureofanything?”
“Jim,” shesnapped suddenly, “you've gottohelpme!”
“My dear.Pm atyour disposal, Pddoanything tohelpyou,” he
answered, therules oftheir language requiring thatanyopen state-
ment beanswered byablatant lie.Lillian wasslipping, hethought—
andheexperienced thepleasure ofdealing with aninadequate
adversary.
Shewasneglecting, henoted, even theperfection ofherparticular
trademark: hergrooming Afewstrands were escaping from the
drilled waves ofherhair—heinails, matching hergown, were thedeep
shade ofcoagulated blood, which made iteasy tonorice thechipped
polish attheir tips—andagainst thebroad, smooth, creamy expanse
ofherskin inthelow,square cutofhergown, heobserved thetiny
glitter ofasafety pinholding thestiap ofherslip
“You’ve gottoprevent it!”shesaid, inthebelligerent toneofa
plea disguised asacommand. “You've gottoslop it!”
“Really? What?”
“My divorce.”
“Oh .!”Hisfeatures dropped intosudden earnestness.
“You know thathe'sgoing todivorce me.don’t you?”
“I’ve heard some rumors about it.”
“It's setfornextmonth. Andwhen 1say \et.that's justwhat l
mean. Oh, it’scosthimplenty- buthe'sbought thejudge, theclerks,
the bailiffs, their backers, their backers' backers, afew legislators,

likeaprivate thoroughfare, and there’s nosingle crossroad leftfor

“Isee.”
“You know, ofcourse, whatmade him start divorce proceedings?”
“Icanguess.”
“And ldid itasafavor toyou*" Hervoice wasgrowing anxiously
shrill. “Itoldyouabout your sister inorder toletyougetthatGift

“1swear fdon’tknowwho let itout!” hecried hastily. “Only a

“Oh, l*msurenobody did.He’d have thebrains toguess it,

“Yes, fsuppose so.Well, thenyouknew thatyouwere taking

Ididn’t think he’dgothat far. 1didn’t think he’dever divorce

Hechuckled suddenly, withaglance ofastonishing perceptiveness.
"You didn’t think that guilt isarope thatwears thin, didyou,
Lillian?”
Shelooked athim. startled, thenanswered stonily. “Idon’t think
itdoes.”
"Itdoes,mydear— -formensuch asyourhusband.”
"Idon’t wanthim todivorce me!” Itwas asudden scream."1
don’twant tolethimgofree! 1won’t permit it! Iwon’t letthewhole

admitted toomuch.
Hewaschuckling softly, nodding hishead with aslowmovement
thathadanairofintelligence, almost ofdignity, bysignifying a
complete understanding.
"1mean . ..after all,he’smyhusband,” shesaiddefensively
“Yes, Lillian, yes, 1know.”
"Doyouknow what he'splanning? He’s going togetthedecree
and he’sgoing tocutmeoffwithout apenny— nosettlement, no
alimony, nothing! He'sgoing tohave the lastword. Don't yousee?
Ifhegetsaway with it,then then theGift Ceitilicate wasno

“Yes,mydear, 1see.”
'And besides ...It’spreposterous that lshould have tothink ol
it.butwhatam1going toliveon7The littlemoney Ihadofmy
own isworth nothing nowadays. It’smainly stock inlactories ofmy
father’s time, thathave closed long ago.Whatam Igoing todo?”
“But, Lillian,” hesaid softly, “Ithought youhadnoconcern for
money orforanymaterial rewards.”
“You don't understand! I'mnottalking about money—I’mtalking
about poverty! Real, stinking, hall-bedroom poverty! That’s out ot
bounds forany civilized person! I-Itoohave toworry about lood
andrent7”
Hewaswatching herwith afaint smile; foronce, hissoft, aging
faceseemed tightened intoalookofwisdom, hewasdiscovering the
pleasure offullperception --inareality which hecould permit him-
selftoperceive.

Heshook hishead slowly, almost compassionately, like atiredm
professional atanoverzealous amateur. “Itcan’tbedone, Lillian/’
hesaid firmly. “I’d liketodo it—forthesame reason asyours—and
lthink youknow it.Butwhatever power Ihave isnotenough in
thiscase.”
Shewaslooking athim,hereyesdarkwithanodd, lifeless stillness;
when shespoke, themotion ofher lipswastwisted bysoevila
contempt thathedidnotdare identify itbeyond knowing that it
embraced them both; shesaid, “Iknow thatyou’d liketodoit”
Hefeltnodesire topretend; oddly, forthe firsttime, forthisone
chance, truthseemed much more pleasurable— truth, foronce, serv-
inghisparticular kind ofenjoyment. “Ithink youknow that itcan’t
hedone,” hesaid.“Nobody does favors nowadays, ifthere’s nothing
togain inreturn. And thestakes aregetting higher andhigher. The
gopher holes, asyou called them, aresocomplex, sotwisted and

nobody daresmove because hecan ttellwho’ll crack which wayor

“Youaskedmetoforce hertospeak onthatbroadcast!”
“1know, Lillian.We lost,both ofuis,thattimeAndwelose,both
otus,now.”
“Yes,” shesaid, with thesame darkness ofcontempt inhereyes,
“both ofus.”
Itwasthecontempt thatpleased him, itwasthestrange, heedless,
unfamiliar pleasure ofknowing that thiswoman sawhimashewas,
yetremained heldbyhispresence, remained andleaned back inher
chair, asifdeclaring herbondage.
“You’re awonderful person, Jim,” shesaid. Ithadthesound of
damnation. Yet itwasatribute, andshemeant itassuch, and his
pleasure came from theknowledge thattheywere inarealm where
damnation wasvalue.
“You know,” hesaidsuddenly, “you’re wrong about those butch-
er’sassistants, likeGonzales. They have their uses.Have youever
liked Francisco d’Anconia?”
“Ican’t stand him.”
“Well, doyouknow therealpurpose ofthatcocktail-swilling occa-
sionstaged bySeftor Gonzales tonight? Itwas tocelebrate the
agreement tonationalize d’Anconia Copper inabout amonth.”
Shelooked athim foramoment, thecomer ofher lips lifting
slowly intoasmile.“Hewasyour friend, wasn’t he?”
Hervoice hadatonehehadnever earned before, thetone ofan
emotion which hehaddrawn from people onlybyfraud, butwhich
821
now, forthe firsttime,wasgranted with fullawareness tothereal,
theactual nature ofhisdeed: atone ofadmiration.
Suddenly, heknew that thiswasthegoalofhisrestless hours, this
wasthepleasure hehaddespaired offinding, thiswasthecelebration
hehadwanted,
'’Let's have adrink, Lil," hesaid.
Pouring theliquor, heglanced atheracross theroom, asshelay

himwith asloppily indifferent sweep ofherhand. Shedrank, not in
themaimer ofasocial gesture, butlikealonely drinker inasaloon—
forthephysical sake oltheliquor.
Hesatdown onthearmofthedavenport, improperly close to
her,andsipped hisdrink, watching heitact. After awhile, heasked,
"What doeshethink ofme9"
Thequestion didnotseem toastonish her."He thinks you’re a

"He’d notice it,il~Hestopped.

He’d merely blame himself fornothaving moved outofthedub's

Sheshifted herbody, sliding lower inthearmchair, stomach for-

kind ofintimacy thatrequired nopoise andnorespect.
"That wasthe firstthing Inoticed about him,” shesaid,"when 1

"You have failed, Lillian."
Shedidnotanswer. Shepushed herhatoffwith theback ofher

herhand inavague motion, indicating thelength ofhersprawled

“No, hedidn’t.”
Hiswords were blurring alittle, asifweighted withdrops ofthe

“You knew itatthetime.”
“Sure. That’s why 1likeyou, Lillian.”
Hiseyeskeptcoming back tothelowcutofhergown. Itwasnot
thesmooth skin that attracted hisglance, nottheexposed riseof
herbreasts, butthefraud ofthesafety pinbeyond theedge.
“I'd liketoseehimbeaten,” hesaid. “I’d liketohearhimscream

“You won’t, Jimmy”
“Why doeshethink he's better than therestofus—heandthat

Shechuckled.

Sheglanced upathisface.“You're such acoward, Jim.”
“Why don't yougetdrunk?” hesnapped, sticking hisunfinished

“Oh hell, Lillian, you’re amess!” hesaidand, nottroubling lo

Heraised hishead toglance atherface.Herteeth werebared in

Hejerked hercloser, tostifle thesight ofhisownshudder. His
hands were going through theautomatic motions ofintimacy—and
shecomplied, butinamanner thatmade him feelasifthebeats of

ofpity, ofembarrassment, ofthatmental chastity which recoils from

Shestood inthemiddle ofherroom, unable tograsp what action
wasnow possible toher.Then herknees gaveway, folding gently,
shefound herself sitting onthefloorandshestayed there, staring
althecarpet, shaking.
Itwasneither anger norjealousy norindignation, buttheblank
horror oldealing with thegrotesquely senseless. Itwastheknowl-
edge thatneither theirmarriage norhislove forhernorhisinsistence

Shedidnotknowhowlong shehad satthere, when sheheard
their steps andvoices, then thesound ofthefront door dosing. She
gotup,withnopurpose inmind, butimpelled bysome instinct from

Shemoved herhands ingroping gestures, half-waving itaway,

After awhile, shesawthatshewaswalking down alittered side-
walk inadark neighborhood, withanelectric bulb glaring inthe
cave ofasubway entrance and alighted billboard advertising soda
crackers ontheblack roofofalaundry. Shedidnotremember how
shehadcome here. Hermind seemed towork inbroken spurts,
without connections. Sheknew only thatshehadtoescape and that
escape wasimpossible.
Shehad toescape from Jim. shethought Where?— sheasked,
looking around herwith aglance likeacryofprayer. Shewould
have seized upon ajobina(ive-and ten,orinthatlaundry, orin
anyofthedismal shops shepassed. Butshewould work, shethought,
andtheharder sheworked, themore malevolence shewould draw
from thepeople around her,andshewould notknow when truth
would beexpected ofherandwhen ahe,butthestricter herhonesty,
thegreater thefraud shewould beasked tosuffer attheir hands.
Shehadseen itbefore andhadborne it,inthehome ofherfamily,
intheshops oftheslums, butshehadthought thatthese were vicious
exceptions, chance evils, toescape and forget. Now sheknew that
theywere notexceptions, that theirs wasthecode accepted bythe
world, that itwasacreed ofliving, known byall,butkeptunnamed,
leering atherfrom people seves inthat sly,guilty look shehad
never been able tounderstand —and attheroot ofthecreed, hidden
bysilence, lying inwait forherinthecellars ofthecityandmthe

Why areyoudoing ittome?— shecried soundlessly tothedark

seemed tobeanswering from theroof topsandfrom thesewers
Then iwon't want tobegood anylonger—Butyou will— Idon’t

Sheshuddered andwalked faster- -butahead ofher, inthefoggy

Sheran.When shelooked around heroncemore, shewaswalking
down aquiet street, pasttheglassdoorways where lights were burn-
inginthecarpeted lobbies ofluxurious buildings. Shenoticed that
shewaslimping, andsawthat theheelofherpump wasloose; she
hadbroken it^omewhere inherblank span ofrunning.
From thesUddcn space ofabroad intersection, shelooked atthe
great skyscrapers inthedistance. They were vanishing quietly into
aveiloffog,with the faint breath ofaglow behind them, with a
few lights likeasmile offarewell. Once, theyhadbeen apromise,
andfrom themidst ofthestagnant slotharound hershehadlooked
tothem forproof thatanother kind ofmen existed. Now sheknew
thattheywere tombstones, slender obelisks soaring inmemory ofthe
menwhohadbeen destroyed forhaving created them, theywere
thefrozen shape ofthesilent crythat thereward ofachievement
wasmarly rdf>m.
Somewhere inoneofthose vanishing towers, shethought, there
wasDagnv— butDagny wasalonely victim, fighting alosing battle,
tobedestroyed andtosink intofogliketheothers.
There isnoplace togo,shethought andstumbled on— 1can't

canneither surrender nor fight- hutthis . .t/us iswhat theywant
ofme, this iswhere theywantme— neither living nordeeid. neither

Sheplunged intothedarkness behind acorner, shrinking indread
lrom anyhuman figure. No.shethought, they're not evil, not all
people . ..they're only theirown first victims, hutthey allbelieve
inJim's creed, and Ican't deal wiihthem, once 1know it . ..and
itIspoke tothem, theywould trytograntmetheirgood will,but
I’dknow what itisthattheyhold asthegoodand 1would seedeath

Thesidewalk hadshrunk toabroken strip,andsplashes ofgarbage
ranoverfrom thecans atthestoops ofcrumbling houses. Beyond
thedusty glow ofasaloon, shesawalighted sign“Young Women's
RestClub" above alocked dooi
Sheknew theinstitutions ofthatkindandthewomen whoran
them, thewomen who said that theirs wasthejobothelping suffer-
ers. Itshewent in--shethought, stumbling past- -ifshefaced them
andbegged them forhelp,“What isyour guilt?" theywould ask
her.“Drink? Dope? Pregnancy? Shoplifting?" Shewould answer. “I
havenoguilt, laminnocent, butYm—"“Sorry.Wehavenoconcern
forthepain oftheinnocent.”
Sheran.Shestopped, regaining hereyesight, onthecorner ofa
long, wide street. The buildings andpavements merged with the
sky—andtwo lines ofgreen lights hung inopen space, going offinto
829
anendless distance, asifstretching intoother towns andoceans and
foreign lands, toencircle theearth. Thegreen glowhadalook of
serenity, likeaninviting, unlimited pathopen toconfident travel.
Then thelights switched tored,dropping heavily lower, turning from
sharp circles intofoggy smears, intoawarning ofunlimited danger.
Shestood andwatched agiant truck goby, itsenormous wheels
crushing onemore layer ofshiny polish intotheflattened cobbles of
thestreet.
The lightswentback tothegreen ofsafety-hut shestood trembling,
unable tomove. That’s how itworks forthetravel ofone’s body,
shethought, butwhathave theydone tothetraffic ofthesoul?They
have setthesignals inreverse— andtheroad issafewhen thelights
aretheredofevil—butwhen the lights arethegreen ofvirtue,
promising thatyours istheright-of-way, youventure forth andarc

verted lights goreaching intoevery land, theygoon.encircling the
earth.And theearth islittered withmangled cripples, who don’t

crushed limbs through their lightless days, withnoanswer save that

These were notwords inhermind, these were thewords which

Shecould notsmash itwith her fists,shecould notbatter oneby

These were notwords inheimind, these were only theblows of
her fistsagaiast metal—thenshesawherself suddenly battering her
knuckles toblood agaiast animmovable post, andthesightmade

around her,feeling trapped inamaze withnoexit.
Noexit—hershreds ofawareness wer<$ saying, beating itintothe

Itwas inthedarkest hour ofthenight, inanalleyamong wharfs
andwarehouses thatthesocial worker saw her.The social worker
wasawoman whose gray faceandgray coatblended with thewalls

staggering blindly, notknowing sidewalks from pavements. The
street wasonly anarrow crack between thesheer, blank walls of
storage structures, butanjyoflight fellthrough afogdank with the
odor ofrotting water; astone parapet ended thestreet ontheedge
ofavastblack holemerging riverandsky.

Then the girlscreamed—andthescream went beating against the

Chapter VTHEIR BROTHERS' KEEPERS
Onthemorning ofSeptember 2,acopper wirebroke inCalifornia,
between twotelephone poles bythetrack ofthePacific branch line
ofTaggart Transcontinental.
Aslow, thin rainhadbeen falling since midnight, andthere had
beennosunrise, only agray lightseeping through asoggy sky—and
thebrilliant raindrops hanging onthetelephone wires hadbeen the
onlysparks glittering against thechalk oftheclouds, thelead ofthe
ocean andthesteel ofthe oilderricks descending aslone bristles
down adesolate hillside. The wires hadbeenworn bymore rains
andyears than theyhadbeen intended tocarry; oneofthemhad
kept sagging, through thehours ofthatmorning, under thefragile
loadofraindrops; then itsone lastdrop hadgrown onthewire’s
831
curve andhadhung likeacrystal bead, gathering theweight ofmany
seconds; thebeadandthewirehadgivenuptogether and,assound-
lessasthe falloftears, thewirehadbroken andfallen with the fall
ofthebead.
Themen attheDivision Headquarters ofTaggart Transcontinental
avoided looking atoneanother, when thebreak ofthetelephone
linewasdiscovered andreported. Theymade statements painfully
miscalculated toseem torefer totheproblem, yettostate nothing,
none fooling theothers. Theyknew thatcopper wirewasavanishing
commodity, more precious than gold orhonor; theyknew thatthe
division storekeeper hadsold their stock ofwireweeks ago, toun-
known dealers whocame bynight andwere notbusinessmen in
thedaytime, butonlymenwhohad friends inSacramento and in
Washington —justasthestorekeeper, recently appointed tothedivi-
sion,hadafriend inNew York, named Cuffy Meigs, aboutwhom
oneasked noquestions. Theyknew thatthemanwhowould now
assume theresponsibility ofordering repairs andinitiating theaction
which would lead tothediscovery that therepairs could notbe
made, would incur retaliation fiomunknown enemies, that hisfellow
workers would become mysteriously silent andwould nottestify to
helphim, thathewould prove nothing, and ifheattempted todo
htsjob, itwould notbehisanylonger. They didnotknow whatwas
safeordangerous these days,when theguilty were notpunished,
buttheaccusers were; and, likeanimals, theyknew thatimmobility
wastheonlyprotection when indoubt and indanger. They remained
immobile; theyspoke about theappropriate proccduic ofsending
reports totheappropriate authorities ontheappropriate dates.
Ayoung roadmaster walked outoftheroom andoutofthehead-
quarters building tothesafely ofatelephone booth inadrugstore
and, athisown expense, ignoring thecontinent and the tiers ol
appropriate executives between, hetelephoned Dagny Taggart in
New York,
Shereceived thecallinherbrother’s office, interrupting anemer-
gency conference. Theyoung roadmaster toldheronly thatthetele-
phone linewasbroken andthattherewasnowire torepair it;hesaid
nothing elseandhedidnotexplain wh)hehadtound itnecessary to
callherinperson. Shedidnotquestion him;sheunderstood. “Thank
you,” was ailthatsheanswered.
Anemergency file inheroffice kept aiccord ofallthecrucial
materials stillonhand, onevery division ofTaggart Transcontinental.
Like the fileofabankrupt, itkept registering losses, while therare
additions ofnewsupplies seemed likethemalicious chuckles ofsome
tormentor throwing crumbs atastarving continent. Shelooked
through the tile,closed it,sighed and s<|d. ‘Montana, Eddie. Phone
theMontana Line toship halftheir stocjt ofwire toCalifornia. Mon-
tanamight beable tolastwithout il-ifor another week.” And as
Eddie Willers wasabout toprotest, she?added, “Oil, Eddie. Califor-
nia isoneoftheIasiproducers ofoilliftinthecountry. Wedon’t
dare losethePacific lane.” Then shewent back totheconference
inherbrother's office.
“Copper wire?” saidJames Taggart, withanoddglance thatwent
832
from herfacetothecitybeyond thewindow. “Inavery short while*
wcwon’t haveanytrouble about copper.”
“Why?” sheasked, buthedidnotanswer. There wasnothing
special toseebeyond thewindow, only theclear skyofasunny day,
thequiet light ofearly afternoon ontheroofs ofthecityand,above
them, thepage ofthecalendar, saying: September 2.
Shedidnotknowwhyhehadinsisted onholding thisconference
inhisown office, whyhehad insisted onspeaking toheralone,
which hehadalways tried toavoid, orwhyhekept glancing athis
wrist watch.
“Things are, itseems tome,going wrong,” hesaid.“Something
hastobedone. There appears toexist astate ofdislocation and
confusion tending toward anunco-ordinated, unbalanced policy.
What Imean is,there’s atremendous national demand fortranspor-
tation, yetwe're losing money. Itseems tome—”
She sallooking attheancestral map ofTaggart Tianscontinental
onthewallofhisoffice, attheredarteries winding across ayellowed
continent. There hadbeen atimewhen therailroad wascalled the
blood system ofthenation, andthe siream oftrains hadbeen like
aliving circuit ofblood, bringing growth andwealth toevery patch
ofwilderness ittouched. Now. itwas still likeastream ofblood, but
liketheone-way stream thatrunsfrom awound, draining the last
o!abody’s sustenance and life.One-way traffic—shethought indif-
ferently— consumers’ traffic.
There wasTrainNumber 193.shethought. Sixweeks ago.Train
Number 193hadbeen sent with aload ofsteel, nottoFaulkton,
Nebraska, where theSpencer Machine foolCompany, thebestma-
chine tendconcern still inexistence, hadbeen idle fortwoweeks,
waiting fortheshipment -but toSand Creek, Illinois, where Confed-
erated Machine hadbeen wallowing indebt forover ayear, produc-
ingunreliable goods atunpredictable times. The steel hadbeen
allocated byadirective which explained that theSpencer Machine
ToolCompany wasarichconcern, able towait, while Confederated
Machines wasbankrupt andcould notbeallowed tocollapse, being
thesolesource oflivelihood ofthecommunity ofSand Creek, Illi-
nois.VheSpencer Machine ToolCompany hadclosed amonth ago.
Confederated Machines hadclosed twoweeks later.
Thepeople ofSand Creek, Illinois, hadbeen placed onnational
relief, butnofood could befound forthem intheempty granaries
ofthenation atthefrantic callofthemoment— sotheseed grain of
thefarmers ofNebraska hadbeen seized byorder oftheUnification
Board— ^andTrainNumber 194hadcarried theunplanted harvest
andthefuture ofthepeople ofNebraska tobeconsumed bythe
people ofIllinois. “In thisenlightened age,” Eugene Lawson had
said inaradio broadcast; “wehavecome, atlast,torealize thateach
oneofusishisbrother’s keeper.”
“Inaprecarious period ofemergency, likethepresent,” James
Taggart wassaying, while shelooked atthemap, “itisdangerous
tofindourselves forced tomisspaydaysandaccumulate wage ar-
rearsonsome ofour divisions, atemporary condition, ofcourse,
but—”
833
Shechuckled. “The Railroad Unification Plan isn’t working, is

Sheglanced athimsharply: hiseyes scurried away.
“What 1mean is,some constructive policy hastobedevised,” he
834
droned onhastily. “Something hastobedone ...bysomebody. In
times ofemergency—’'
Sheknew what thought hehadscurried toavoid, what hinthe
hadgiven her,yetdidnotwant hertoacknowledge ordiscuss. She
knew thatnotrain schedules could bemaintained anylonger, no
promises kept, nocontracts observed, that regular trains were can-
celled atamoment’s notice andtransformed intoemergency specials
sentbyunexplained orders tounexpected destinations— andthatthe
orders came from Cuffy Meigs, solejudge ofemergencies andofthe
public weltare. Sheknew that factories were dosing, some with their
machinery stilled forJackofsupplies thathadnotbeen received,
others with theirwarehouses fullofgoods thatcould notbedeliv-
ered. Sheknew that theoldindustries— thegiants whohad built
theirpower byapurposeful course projected over aspan oftime—
were lefttoexist atthewhim olthemoment, amoment theycould
notforesee orcontrol. Sheknew that thebestamong them, those
olthelongest range andmost complex function, hadlong since
gone--and those stillstruggling toproduce, struggling savagely to
preserve thecode ofanagewhen production hadbeen possible, were
now inserting into their contracts alineshameful toadescendant of
NatTaggart: “Transportation permitting.”
And yetthere weremen- -and sheknew' it™whowere able to
obtain transportation whenever they wished, asbyamystic secret,
asbythegrace ofsome power which onewasnottoquestion or
explain. Theywere themenwhose dealings withCuffy Meigs were
regarded bypeople asthatunknowable ofmystic creeds which smites
theobserver foithesmoflooking, sopeople kept their eyes closed,
dreading, notignorance, butknowledge. Sheknew thatdeals were
made whereby thosemen sold acommodity known as“transporta-
tion puli’"-atermwhich allunderstood, butnonewould dare define.
Sheknew thatthese were themen ottheemergency specials, the
menwhocould cancel herscheduled trains andsendthem toany
random spotofthecontinent which theychose tostrike with thcii
voodoo stamp, thestamp superseding contract, property, justice, rea-
sonand lives, thestamp stating that“the public welfare” required
theimmediate salvation ofthat spot, lliese were themenwho sent
trains totherelief oftheSmather Brothers and their grapefruit in
Arizona- -totherelief ofafactory inFlorida engaged intheproduc-
tionofpin-ball machines—tothe relief ofahorse farm inKen-
tucky —totherelief ofOrren Boyle's Associated Steel.
These were themenwhomade deals withdesperate industrialists
toprovide transportation forthegoods stalled intheirwarehouses—
or.failing toobtain thepercentage demanded, made deals topur-
chase thegoods, when thefactory closed, atthebankruptcy sale, at
tencents onthedollar, andtospeed thegoods awaymfreight cars
suddenly available, away tomarkets where dealers ofthesame kind
wereready forthe kill.There were themenwhohovered over fac-
tories, waiting forthe lastbreath ofafurnace, topounce upon the
equipment— andover desolate sidings, topounce upon thefreight
carsofundelivered goods— these were anew biological species, the
hit-and-run businessmen, who didnotstay inany lineofbusiness
835
longer than thespan ofonedeal,whohadnopayrolls 16meet, no
overhead tocarry, noreal estate toown,noequipment tobuild,
whose only assetandsoleinvestment consisted ofanitemknown as
“friendship.” These were themenwhom official speeches described
as“the progressive businessmen ofourdynamic age,” butwhom
people called “the pullpeddlers”— thespecies included many breeds,
those of“transportation pull,” andof“steel pull” and“oilpull”and
“wage-raise pull” and“suspended sentence pull”—menwhowere
dynamic, whokept darting allover thecountry while noone else
could move, menwhowere active andmindless, active, not like
animals, but like thatwhich breeds, feeds andmoves upon the
stillness ofacorpse.
Sheknew that there wasmoney tobehadoutoftherailroad
business andsheknewwhowasnowobtaining it.Cuffy Meigs was
selling trains ashewas selling the lastoftherailroad’s supplies,
whenever hecould rigasetup which would not let itbediscovered
orproved—selling railtoroads inGuatemala ortotrolley companies
inCanada, selling wire tomanufacturers ofjuke boxes, selling cross-
tiesforfuel inresort hotels.
Did itmatter—shethought, looking atthemap— which partofthe
corpse hadbeenconsumed bywhich type ofmaggot, bythosewho
gorged themselves orbythosewhogave thefood toother maggots?
Solong asliving fleshwasprey tobedevoured, did itmatter whose
stomachs ithadgone tofill?There wasnowaytotellwhich devasta-
tionhadbeen accomplished bythehumanitarians andwhich byun

What were they thinking now. thechampions ofneed andthe

whohadonce simpered: “Idon’t want todestroy therich, Ionly
want toseize alittle oftheir surplus tohelp thepoor, justalittle,

“Well, take it.”

“Take your reality. I’llmerely takeyour orders.”

“I’m notgoing tohelpyoupretend—byarguing withyou—that

“No!” Theexplosion came, oddly, now; itwasthescream ofa
manwhowould dierather than betray hisidea,and itcame from a
manwhohadspent his lifeevading theexistence ofideas, acting
with theexpediency ofacriminal. Shewondered whether shehad
everunderstood theessence ofcriminals. Shewondered about the
nature oftheloyalty totheideaofdenying ideas.
“No!” hecried, hisvoice lower, hoarser andmore normal, sinking
from thetone ofazealot tothelone ofanoverbearing executive.
“That’s impossible! That’s outofthequestion!”
“Who saidso?”
“Never mind! It’sso!Whydoyoualways think oftheimpractical?

Sheburst outlaughing.
There,shethought, wastheultimate goalofallthatloose academic
prattle which businessmen hadignored foryears, thegoalofallthem
slipshod definitions, thesloppy generalities, thesoupy abstractions,
allclaiming thatobedience toobjective reality isthesame asthe
obedience totheState, thatthere isnodifference between alawof
nature andabureaucrat's directive, thatahungry man isnot free,
thatmanmust bereleased from thetyranny offood, shelter and
clothing— allof it,foryears, that thedaymight come when Nat
Taggart, the realist, would beasked toconsider the willofCuffy
Meigs asafactofnature, irrevocable andabsolute like steel, rails
and gravitation, toaccept theMeigs made world asanobjective,
unchangeable reality— then tocontinue producing abundance inthat
world. There wasthegoalofallthose conmenoflibrary and class-
100m,who sold their revelations asreason, their “instincts” assci-
ence, their cravings asknowledge, thegoal ofallthesavages of

Asdistant remnants oftheexplosion’s wreckage* shenoticed a

thesight ofJim’s shoulders shaking over atelephone and hisdis^
torted voice screaming, “But, Rodrigo, you said itwas safe! Ro-

There were people rushing into theoffice, thetelephones were
screaming and, alternating between pleas andcurses, Junkept yelling

Distantly, asonthemargin ofhermind, shecould seewhat sort

ofawed uncertainty inpeople’s manner— uncertainty oftheirown

“Dagny," heasked suddenly, “doyousuppose he’s inNewYork?"
“No. I'vecalled theWayne-Falkland. They toldmethatthelease

“They’re looking lorhim ailover theworld," hesaid, smiling.

“They’ll never findhim.” Thesmile vanished. “Neither will I.”His
voice slipped back tothe flat,graytoneofduty: “Well, themills are
working, butTmnot.I’mdoing nothing butrunning around the

“Tired, Hank?”
“Bored todeath.”
There wasatime, shethought, when hismind, hisenergy, his
inexhaustible resourcefulness hadbeen given tothetaskofapro-
ducer devising better ways todeal with nature; now, theywere
switched tothetask ofacriminal outwitting men. Shewondered
howlong amancould endure achange ofthat kind.
“It’sbecoming almost impossible togetironore,” hesaid indifici-
ently, then added, hisvoice suddenly alive,“Now it’sgoing tobe
completely impossible togetcopper.” Howasgrinning.
Shewondered howlong aman could continue towork against
himself, toworkwhen hisdeepest desire wasnottosucceed, but
tofail.
Sheunderstood theconnection ofhisthoughts when hesaid. “I’ve

“He toldme.”

The effort bywhich hemade hisfacegrow rigid, wasalmost like

what motive was stillholding him tohisjob.“Dagny, theyhadto

“It’s allright. Hank. We’ll lastwith such railaswehave, for—”
Shestopped.
“For amonth?”
“For thewinter—lhope.”
Cutting across their silence, ashrill voice reached them from an-
other table, andthey turned tolook atamanwhohadthejittery

“What would youdo, ifyouknew it?”
Hedropped hishand inagesture offutility. “Iwouldn't approach

They remained silent. They listened tothevoices around them, to
thesplinters ofpanic trickling through theluxurious room.
Shehadnotbeenaware thatthesame presence seemed tobean
invisible guest atevery table, that thesame subject kept breaking
through theattempts atanyother conversation. People satinaman-

“Idon’t understand it,”anoldmanwassaying with quavering

Themuffled scream ofawoman across theroom andsome half

Shedidnotknow which shock wasgreater: thesight ofthemes-

Ontheevening ofSeptember 7,acoppei wirebroke inMontana,
stopping themotor ofaloading crane onaspur track ofTaggart
Transcontinental, attherimoftheStanfoid Copper Mine.
Themine hadbeen working onthree shifts, itsdaysandnights
blending into asingle stretch ofstruggle tolosenominute, nodrop
ofcopper itwould squeeze from theshelves ofamountain intothe
nation's industrial desert Thecrane broke down atthetask otload-
ingaliain: itstopped abruptly andhung stillagainst theevening sky,
between astring olempty carsand piles ofsuddenly immovable ore.
Themenoftherailroad andofthemine stopped indazed bewil-
derment: theyfound that inallthecomplexity oftheir equipment,
among the drills, ihemotors, thederricks, thedelicate gauges, the
ponderous floodlights beating down into the pitsandridges ofa
mountain—there wasnowite tomend thecrane. They stopped, like
menonanocean liner propelled byten-thousand -horsepower gener-
ators. butperishing forlackofasafety pin.
The station agent, ayoung man with aswiftbodyandabrusque
voice, stripped thewiring from thestation building andsetthecrane
inmotion again -andwhile theorewent clattering to tillthecars,
thelight ofcandles came trembling through theduskfrom thewin-
dows ofthestation.
“Minnesota, Eddie,” saidDagny grimly, dosing thedrawer ofher
special file.“Tell theMinnesota Division toship hall their slock of
wire toMontana.” “ButgoodGod.Dagny1—with thepeak ofthe
harvest rushapproaching “They'll holdthrough it— 1think.We
don’t dare loseasingle supplier ofcopper.”
“But 1have!” screamed James Taggart, when shereminded him
oncemore. “1have obtained foiyouthetoppriority oncopper wire,
the first claim, theuppermost ration level, Fvcgiven you allthe
cards, certificates, documents andrequisitions— what elsedoyou
warn'*” “The copper wire.” “!'ve done all 1could! Nobody can
blame me!”
Shedidnotargue. The afternoon newspaper was lyingonbis
desk— andshewasstaring atanitemontheback page:AnEmer-
gency StateTaxhadbeen passed inCalifornia fortherelief ofthe
state’s unemployed, intheamount offiftypercentofanylocal cor-
poration’s grossincome ahead ofother taxes; theCalifornia oilcom-
panies hadgone outofbusiness.
“Don’t worry, Mr.Rearden.” saidanunctuous voice overalong-
distance telephone linefrom Washington, “ljustwanted toassure
youthatyouwillnothave toworry.” “About what?’' asked Rearden,
847
baffled. “About thattemporary bitofconfusion inCalifornia. We’ll
straighten itoutinnotime, itwasanactofillegal insurrection, their
stategovernment hadnoright toimpose local taxes detrimental to
national taxes, we’ll negotiate anequitable arrangement immedi-
ately—butinthemeantime, ifyouhavebeen disturbed byanyunpa-
triotic rumors about theCalifornia oilcompanies, Ijustwanted to
tellyouthatRcarden Steel hasbeen placed inthetopcategory of
essential need, with firstclaim upon any oilavailable anywhere in
thenation, verytopcategory, Mr.Rcarden—so Ijustwanted you
toknow thatyouwon’t have toworry about theproblem offuel
thiswinter!"
Rearden hung upthetelephone receiver, with afrown ofworry,
notabout theproblem offueland theendoftheCalifornia oil
fields—disasters ofthiskindhadbecome habitual—butabout the
factthattheWashington planners found itnecessary toplacate him.
Tinswasnew;hewondered what itmeant. Through theyears ofhis
struggle, hehadlearned thatanapparently causeless antagonism was
nothard todeal with, butanapparently causeless solicitude wasan
uglydanger. Thesamewonder struck himagain, when, walking down
analleybetween themill structures, hecaught sight ofaslouching
figure whose posture combined anairofinsolence withanairof
expecting tobeswatted: itwas hisbrother Philip.
Ever since hehadmoved toPhiladelphia, Rearden hadnotvisited
hisformer home andhadnotheard aword from hisfamily, whose
billshewentonpaying Then, inexplicably, twice inthe lastfew
weeks, hehadcaught Philip wandering through themills fornoap-
parent reason. Hehadbeen unable totellwhether Philip wassneak-
ingtoavoid himorwaiting tocatch hisattention; ithadlooked like
both.Hehadbeen unable todiscover anyclue toPhilip's purpose,
onlysome incomprehensible solicitude, ofakind Philip hadnever
displayed before.
The first time, inanswer tohisstartled “What are>oudoing
here?”— Philip hadsaidvaguely. “Well, 1know thatyoudon’t like
metocome toyour office." “What doyouwant?” “Oh. nothing ..
but . . .well.Mother isworried about you." “Mother can callme
anytime shewishes." Philip hadnotanswered, buthadproceeded
toquestion him, inanunconvincingly casual manner, about hiswork,
hishealth, hisbusiness; thequestions hadkept hitting oddly beside
thepoint, notquestions about business, butmore about his.Rear-
den’s, feelings toward business. Rearden had cuthim short and
waved himaway, buthadbeen leftwith thesmall, nagging sense of
anincident thatremained inexplicable.*
Thesecond time, Philip had said, as,,soleexplanation, “We just
want toknowhowyou feel.” “Who’s v^e?"“Why . .Mother and
I.These aredifficult times and .. .well^Mother wants toknowhow
youfeelabout itall.”“Tell herthat 1don’t.” Thewords hadseemed
tohitPhilip insome peculiar manner, almost asifthiswere theone
answer hedreaded. “Get outofhere,” Rearden hadordered wearily,
“and thenexttimeyouwant toseeme,make anappointment and
come tomyoffice. Butdon’tcome unless youhave something to
848
say.This isnotaplace where onediscusses feelings, mine orany-
body else’s.”
Philip hadnotcalled foranappointment —butnowthere hewas
again, slouching among thegiant shapes ofthefurnaces, withan
airofguiltandsnobbishness together, asifhewere bothsnooping
andslumming.
“But 1dohavesomething tosay! 1do!”hecried hastily, inanswer
totheangry frown onRearden’s face.
“Why didn't youcome tomyoffice?”
“You don't wantmeinyour office.”
“Idon’t wantyouhere, either.”
“Bui I’monly ...I’monly trying tobeconsiderate andnotto
takeyour timewhen you're sobusyand ..youarevery busy,
aren't you?”
“And?”
“And . .well, 1justwanted tocatch you inasparemoment . .,
totalktoyou.”
“About what?”
“!...Well, 1need ajob.”
Hesaid itbelligerently anddrew back alittle. Rearden stood
looking athimblankly.
“Henry, Iwant ajob. Imean, here, atthe mills. 1want you to
gi\emesomething todo. 1need ajob. 1need toearnmyliving. I'm
tired ofalms”Hewasgroppmg torsomething tosay, hisvoice both
offended andpleading, asifthenecessity tojustify thepleawerean
unfair imposition upon him “1want alivelihood ofmyown. I'm
notasking you lorcharity. I'masking you togivemeachance!”
“This isafactory. Philip, notagambling joint.”
“Uh?”
“We don’t takechances orgivethem.”
“I'm asking youtogivemeajob\"
“Why should I?”
“Because Ineed ilr”
Rcaidenpointed totheredspuits ottlamc shooting from theblack
shape otafurnace, shooting safely intospace fourhundred ketof
steel-clay-and-steanvembodied thought above them. “1needed that
iurnace. Philip. Itwasn't nivneed thatgave ittome.”
Philip sfaceassumed alook ofnothaving heard. “You’re not
officially supposed tohireanybody, butthat's justatechnicality, if
you’ll putmeon,myfiiends willokay itwithout anytrouble and—”
Something about Rcarden’s eyesmade himstop abruptly, then ask
manangrily impatient voice, “Well, what’s thematter? What have
Isaid that's wrong?”
“What youhaven't said.”
“1begyourpardon?”
“What you're squirming toleave unmentioned.”
“What?”
“That you'd beofnousetomewhatever.”
“Isthatwhatyou—”Philip started withautomatic righteousness,
hutstopped anddidnot finish.
“Yes,” saidRearden, smiling, “//wix’s what 1think offirst.”
849
Philip’s eyesoozed away; when hespoke, hisvoice bounded asif
itwere darting about atrandom, picking stray sentences: “Everybody
isentitled toalivelihood .. .Howam 1going toget it,ifnobody
givesmemychance?”
“How did 1getmine?”
“Iwasn’t bornowning asteel plant.”
“Was I?”
“1candoanything youcan—ifyou’ll teach me.”
“Who taught me?”
“Why doyoukeep saying that? I’mnottalking about you!”
“Iam.”
Inamoment. Philip muttered. “What doyouhave toworry about?
It’snotyour livelihood that’s inquestion!”
Rearden pointed tothefigures ofmen inthesteaming raysofthe
furnace. “Can youdowhat they’re doing?”
“idon’t seewhat you’re—”
“What willhappen if1putyouthere andyouruinaheatofsteel
forme?"
“What’s more important, thatvourdamn steel getspoured orthat
1eat?”
“How doyoupropose toeat ifthesteel doesn't getpoured?”
Philip's faceassumed alook ofreproach “I’m not inaposition
toargue withyou rightnow. since youhold theupper hand.”
“Then don’t argue.”
“Uh?”
“Keep yourmouth shutand getoutolhere.”
“Rut lmeant—” Hestopped.
Rearden chuckled. “You meant that it’s Iwhoshould keepmy
mouth shut, because Ihold theupper hand, andshould give into
you,because youholdnohand atall?”
“That's apeculiarly crude wayofstating amoral principle”
“But that’s what yourmoral principle amounts to.doesn’t it?”
“You can’t discuss morality inmaterialistic terms.”
“We’re discussing ajob inasteel plant -and.boy1isthat amalcn
alistic place!”
Philip’s bodydrew ashade tighter together and hiseyesbecame
ashade more glazed, asifinfearoftheplace around him. inresent-
ment ofitssight, inaneffort nottoconcede itsreality. Hesaid, in
thesoft,stubborn whine ofavoodoo incantation. “It’s amoral im-
perative, universally conceded inourdayandage. thateveryman is
entitled toajob.” Hisvoice rose:‘Tin entitled toit!”
“You are? Cioon,then, collect your claim”
“Uh?”
“Collect your job.Pick itoffthebusfiwhere youthink itgrows.”
“Imean—
” {
“Youmean that itdoesn’t? Youmeafo thatyouneed it,butcan’t
create it?Youmean thatyou’re entitled toaiobwhich /must create
foryou?”
“Yes!”
“And if1don’t?”
The silence went stretching through second after second. “1don’t

understand you,” said Philip: hisvoice hadtheangry bewilderment
ofamanwho recites theformulas ofawell-tested role, butkeeps
getting thewrong cues inanswer. “1don’t understand whyonecan’t
talktoyouanymore. Idon’t understand what sortoftheory you’re
propounding and—”
“Oh yes,youdo.”
As ifrefusing tobelieve thattheformulas could fail, Philip burst
outwith: “Since when didyoutake toabstract philosophy? You’re
only abusinessman, you’re notqualified todealwith questions of
principle, youought toleave ittotheexperts whohaveconceded
forcenturies—’
“Cut it,Philip. What’s thegimmick?”
“Gimmick?”
“Why thesudden ambition?”
“Well, atatime like this ..
“Like what?”
“Well, everyman hastheright tohavesome means ofsupport

Imean, atatime like this, ifanything happened toyou. I’dhave

“What doyouexpect tohappen tome?”
“Oh, Idon’t! Idon’t!” Thecrywasoddly, incomprehensibly genu-
ine.“Jdon’t expect anything tohappen! .. .Doyou?”
“Such aswhat?”
“How do Iknow? . . .But I'vegotnothing except thepittance

“1might.”
‘‘And Ihaven't anyholdonyou atall.”
“Why did ittakeyou thatmany years torealize itand startwor-

“Because .. .because you’ve changed. You ..youused tohave
asense ofdutyandmoral responsibility, but ..you’re losing it.
You’re losing it,aren't you?”
Kearden stood studying him silently: there wassomething peculiar
inPhilip’s manner ofsliding toward questions, asifhiswords were
accidental, butthetoocasual, thefaintly insistent questions were the
keytohispurpose.
“Well. I’llbeglad totaketheburden offyour shoulders, ifI'ma

vourconscience won't have tobother youaboutmeanylonger!”
itdoesn't.”
“That’s what lmean! You don’t care.You don't carewhat be-

“Ofwhom?”
“Why ...Mother andmeand ...andmankind ingeneral. But
I'mnotgoing toappeal toyour better self. Iknow thatyou’re ready

“You’re lying, Philip. Thai’s notwhat you’re worried about. Ifit
were, you’d beangling forachunk ofcash, notlorajob,not—”
H5\
“No! Iwant ajob!”The crywasimmediate andalmost frantic.
“Don't trytobuymeoffwith cash! Iwant ajob!"
“Pull yourself together, youpoor louse.Doyouhear what
you’re saying?”
Philip spitouthisanswer withimpotent hatred: “You can’t talk
tomethatway!”
“Canyou?"
“1only—”
“Tobuyyouoff?Why should Itrytobuyyouoff— instead of
kicking youout, asIshould have, years ago?”
“Well, after all.I’myour brother!”
“What isthatsupposed tomean?”
“One’s supposed tohavesome sortofleelmg forone’s brother.”
“Doyou?"
Philip’s mouth swelled petulantly: hedidnotanswer: hewaited;
Rearden lethim wait. Philip muttered, “You’re supposed ... at
least... tohavesome consideration formyfeelings . .butyou
haven’t.”
“Have youformine?”
“Yours? Your feelings?" Itwasnotmalice inPhilip’s voice, but
worse: itwasagenuine, indignant astonishment. “You haven’t any
feelings. You’ve never feltanything atall.You’ve never suffered!”
Itwasasifasumofyears hitRearden intheface, bymeans ot
asensation and asight: theexact sensation ofwhat hehad felt in
thecabofthe first train’s engine ontheJohn HaltLine— -and the
sight ofPhilip’s eyes, thepale, halt-liquid eyespiesentmg theutter
most ofhuman degiadation: anuncontested pain, and. with theob-
scene insolence ofaskeleton toward aliving being, demanding that
hispainbeheld asthehighest ofvalues. You’ve never suffered, the
eyeswere saying tohimaccusingly— while hewasseeing thenight
inhisoffice when hisoremines were taken away fromhim— the
moment when hehadsigned theGift Certificate surrendering Reai-
denMetal— themonth ofdays inside aplane thatsearched forthe
remains ofDagny’s body. You’ve never suffered, theeyeswere say-
ingwith self-righteous scorn—while heremembered thesensation of
proud chastity withwhich hehadfought through those moments,
refusing tosurrender topain, asensation made ofhislove, ofhis
loyalty ofhisknowledge thatjoy isthegoalofexistence, andjoy is
nottobestumbled upon, buttobeachieved, andtheactoftreason
istolet itsvision drown intheswamp ofthemoment’s torture.
You’ve never suffered, thedead stare oftheeyeswassaying, you’ve

Hewasseeing thenature ofthose who, forcenturies, hadnot re-
852
coiled from thepreachers ofannihilation —hewasseeing thenature
oftheenemies hehadbeen fighting allhis life.
“Philip,’’ hesaid, “get outofhere/’ Hisvoice was likearayof
sunlight inamorgue, ilwastheplain, dry, daily voice ofabusiness-
man, thesound ofhealth, addressed toanenemy onecould not
honor byanger, noreven byhorror “And don’t ever trytoenter
these mills again, because there willbeorders atevery gatetothrow

“Well, after all,” said Philip, intheangry andcautious tone ofa
tentative threat, “Icould havemyfriends assignmetoajobhere
andcompel youtoaccept it!”
Rcardcn hadstarted togo.buthestopped andturned tolook at
hisbrother.
Philip’s moment ofgrasping asudden revelation wasnotaccom-
plished bymeans ofthought, butbymeans ofthatdark sensation
which was hisonlymode ofconsciousness: hetellasensation of
terror, squeezing histhroat, shivering down into hisstomach—he
wasseeing thespread ofthemills, with theroving streamers offlame,
with theladles ofmolten metal sailing through space ondelicate
cables, withopen pitsthecolor ofglowing coal, withcranes coming
athishead, pounding past, holding tons olsteel bytheinvisible
power ofmagnets— andheknew thathewas afraid ofthisplace,
afraid tothedeath, thathedared notmove without theprotection
andguidance oftheman before him—then helooked atthe tall,
straight figure standing casually still, thefigure with theunflinching
eyeswhose sighthadcutthrough rockandflame tobuild thisplace—
andthenheknewhow easily themanhewaspioposing tocompel

orletasingle crane drop itsload afoot short olitsgoal,andthere

protection layinthefact that hismindwould think ofsuch actions,
butthemind olHank Rearden would not.
“But we'd better keep itonafriendly basis.' "said Philip.
“You’d better.” saidRearden andwalked away.
Menwhoworship pain -thought Rearden. staring attheimage of
Iheenemies hehadnever been able tounderstand -they're men
whoworship pain. Itseemed monstrous, yetpeculiarly devoid of
importance. He feltnothing. Itwas liketrying tosummon emotion
toward inanimate objects, toward refuse sliding down amountainside
tocrush him.Onecould fleefrom theslide orbuild retaining walls
against itorbecrushed—butonecould notgrant anyanger, indigna-
tionormoral concern tothesenseless motions oftheunliving; no,
worse, hethought—theanti-living.
Thesame sense ofdetached unconcern remained withhimwhile

Lillian wasnotpresent inthecourtroom; herattorney made ges-
tures once inawhile, with theenergy ofletting water runthrough
hisfingers. They allknew theverdict inadvance andtheyknew its
reason; noother reason hadexisted foryears, where nostandards,
savewhim, had existed. Theyseemed toregard itastheir ngbrtul
prerogative; they acted asifthepurpose oftheprocedure were not
totryacase, buttogivethem jobs, asiftheir jobswere torecite
theappropriate formulas withnoresponsibility toknow what the
formulas accomplished, asifacourtroom were theoneplace where
questions ofrightandwrong were irrelevant and they, themen in
charge otdispensing justice, were safely wiseenough toknow thatno
justice existed. They acted likesavages performing aritual devised to
setthem free oiobjective reality.
Butthetenyears ofhismarriage hadbeen real,hethought—and
these were themenwhoassumed thepower todispose of it,to
decide whether hewould have achance ofcontentment onearth or
becondemned totorture fortherestofhislifetime. Heremembered
theausterely pitiless respect hehad feltforhiscontract ofmarriage,
for allhiscontracts and allh»slegal obligations -andhesaw'what
sortoflegality hisscrupulous observance wasexpected toserve.
Henoticed thatthepuppets ofthecourtroom hadstarted byglanc-
ingathim inthe sly,wisemanner offellow conspirators sharing a
common guilt, mutually salefrom moral condemnation. Then,when
they7observed thathewastheonlyman intheroomwholooked
steadily straight atanyone's lace,hesawresentment growing inthen-
eyes. Incredulously, herealized what itwas thathadbeen expected
ofhim: he,thevictim, chained, bound, gagged and leftwithnore-
course save tobribery, hadbeen expected tobelieve that thefarce
hehadpurchased wasaprocess oflaw, thattheedicts enslaving him
hadmoral validity, thathewas guilty ofcorrupting theintegrity of
theguardians ofjustice, and that theblame was his,not theirs. It
was likeblaming thevictim ofaholdup torcorrupting theintegrity
ofthethug.And yet—hethought— through allthegenerations of
political extortion, itwasnotthelooting bureaucrats whohadtaken
theblame, butthechained industrialists, notthemenwhopeddled
legal favors, butthemenwhowere forced tobuythem; andthrough
allthose generations ofcrusades against corruption, theremedy hail
always been, nottheliberating ofthevictims, butthegranting of
wider powers forextortion totheextortionists. Theonly guilt ofthe
victims, hethought, hadbeen thattheyaccepted itasguilt.
When hewalked outofthecourtroom -into thechilly drizzle ofa
gray afternoon, hefeltasifhehad beefi divorced, notonlyfrom
Lillian, butfrom thewhole ofthehuman? society thatsupported the
procedure hehadwitnessed.\
The faceofhisattorney, anelderly man oftheold-fashioned
school, wore anexpression thatmade itlook asifhelonged totake

Ontheafternoon ofSeptember 11 ,acopper wirebroke inMinne-
sota, stopping thebelts ofagram elevator atasmall country station
ofTaggart Transcontinental.
Aflood ofwheat wasmoving down thehighways, theroads, the
abandoned trails ofthecountryside, emptying thousands ofacres of
farmland upon the fragile dams oftherailroad’s stations, ftwas
moving dayand night, the first trickles growing intostreams, then
livers, then torrents—moving onpalsied trucks withcoughing, tuber-
cularmotors— onwagons pulled bytherusty skeletons ofstarving
horses— oncarts pulled byoxen—onthenerves and lastenergy of
menwhohadlived through twoyears ofdisaster forthetriumphant
reward otthisautumn's giant har\e*l. menwhohadpatched their
trucks and carts with wire, blankets, ropes andsleepless nights, to
make them hold together forthisonemore journey, tocarry the
grain andcollapse atdestination, huttogive theirowners achance
atsurvival.
Every year, atthisseason, another movement hadgone clicking
across thecountry, drawing freight carsfrom allcorners oftheconti-
nent totheMinnesota Division ofiaggart Transcontinental, thebeat
oftram wheels preceding thecreak ofthewagons, likeanadvance
echo rigorously planned, ordered andtimed tomeet theflood. The
Minnesota Division drowsed through theyear, tocome toviolent
lifeforthesounds oftheharvest; fourteen thousand freight carshad
lammed itsyards each year: fifteen thousand wereexpected thistime.
The litstofthewheat trains hadstarted tochannel theHood into
thehungry flour mills, then bakeries, thenstomachs ofthenation—
hutevery train, carandstorage elevator counted, andthere wasno
minute orinchofspace tospare.
Eddie Willers watched Dagny’s lace asshewent through thecards

expression. “The Terminal.” shesaid quietly, closing the tile.“Phone
theTerminal downstairs andhavethem ship halftheir stock ofwire
toMinnesota.” Eddie saidnothing andobeyed.
Hesaidnothing, themorning when heputonherdesk atelegram
from theTaggart office inWashington, informing them ofthedirec*
livewhich, duetothe critical shortage ofcopper, ordered govern-
ment agents toseize allcopper mines andoperate them asapublic
utility. “Well,** shesaid,dropping thetelegram intothewastebasket,
“that’s theendofMontana.”
Shesaidnothing when James Taggart announced toherthathe
wasissuing anorder todiscontinue alldining carsonTaggart trains.
“We can’t afford itanylonger,” heexplained, “we’ve always lost
857
money onthosegoddamn diners, andwhen there's nofood togel,
when restaurants areclosing because they can’t grabholdofapound
ofhorse meat anywhere, howcanrailroads beexpected todoit?

lucky ifwegivethem transportation, they’d travel incattle cars if

they’ve gotnoother trains totake!”
Thetelephone onherdeskhadbecome, notavoice ofbusiness,
butanalarm suen forthedesperate appeals ofdisaster. “Miss Tag-
gart.wehave nocopper wire!” “Nails, Miss Taggart, plain nails,
could you tellsomebody tosend usakegofnails?” “Can you find
anypaint. Miss Taggart, anysortofwaterproof paint anywhere?”
But thirty million dollars ofsubsidy money fromWashington had
beenplowed intoProject Soybean—anenormous acreage inLouisi-
ana.where aharvest ofsoybeans was ripening, asadvocated and
organized byEmma Chalrneis, for(hepurpose otreconditioning the
dietary habits otthenation,Emma Chalmers, better known asKip’s
Ma,wasanoldsociologist whohadhung about Washington for
years, asotherwomen ofherageandtypehang about barrooms.
Forsome reason which nobody could define, thedeath ofherson
inthetunnel catastrophe hadgiven her inWashington anaura of
martyrdom, heightened byherrecent conversion toBuddhism. “The
soybean isamuchmoic sturdy, nutritious andeconomical plant than
alltheextravagant foods which ourwasteful, self-indulgent diethas
conditioned ustoexpect.” Kip’sMahadsaidover theradio; her
voice always sounded asifitwere falling indrops, notofwater, but

“Copper tubing. Miss Taggart, could yougetsome copper tubing
forussomewhere?” thevoices were pleading over hertelephone
“Rail spikes. Miss Taggart!” “Screwdrivers, Miss Taggart!” “Light
bulbs. Miss Taggart, there's noelectric light bulbs tobehadany-
where within twohundred miles ofus!”
But fivemillion dollars wasbeing spdnt bytheoffice ofMorale

Seven million dollars hadbeen granted koapsychologist incharge

turer ofanew electronic cigarette lighter—butthere werenociga-

858
cameras, butnofilm. "Hieproduction ofairplanes hadbeen declared
“temporarily suspended." Airtravel forprivate purposes hadbeen
forbidden, andreserved exclusively formissions of“public need.”
Anindustrialist traveling tosave hisfactory wasnotconsidered as
publicly needed andcould notgetaboard aplane; anofficial travel-
ingtocollect taxes wasandcould.
“People arestealing nutsandbolts outofrailplates. MissTaggart,

Butasuper-color-four-foot-screen television setwasbeing erected

‘The trouble with outmodern world," Dr.Robert Stadler said
over theiadio, attheceremonies launching theconstruction ofthe
cyclotron, “isthattoomany people think toomuch. Itisthecause
olallourcurrent fearsanddoubts. Anenlightened citizenry should
abandon thesuperstitious worship oflogicandtheoutmoded reli-

leave allthinking totheexperts andhave faith intheexperts' higher
authority Only experts areable tounderstand thediscoveries of
modem science, which have proved thatthought isanillusion and
thatthemind isamyth."
“This ageofmisery isGod's punishment toman torthesinof

Andconfronting herdaily there wasthefinalproduct ofitall,the
heirand collectoi—Cully Meigs, theman impervious tothought.
Cliffy Meigs strode through theoffices ofTaggart Transcontinental,
wearing asemi-military tunicandslapping ashiny leather briefcase
against hisshiny leather leggings. Heearned anautomatic pistol in
onepocket andarabbit’s foot intheother.
Cuffy Meigs tried toavoid her; hismanner waspart scorn, asif
heconsidered heranimpractical idealist, part superstitious awe. as
ifshepossessed some incomprehensible power withwhich hepre-
ferred nottotangle. Heacted asifherpresence didnotbelong to

heexpected Jimtokeep her inline, aspartoftheequipment.
Beyond thewindow ofheroffice, likeapatch ofadhesive plaster
stuck over awound onthesky,thepage ofthecalendar hung blank
mthedistance. Thecalendar hadnever been repaired since thenight
859
ofFrancisco’s farewell. The officials whohadrushed tothetower,
that night, hadknocked thecalendar’s motor toastop, while tearing
thefilmoutoftheprojector. They hadfound thesmall square of
Francisco’s message, pasted intothestripofnumbered days, butwho
hadpasted itthere,whohadentered thelocked room andwhen and
how,wasnever discovered bythethree commissions stillinvestigat
ingthecase. Pending theoutcome ottheir efforts, thepagehung
blank and stillabove the city.
Itwasblank ontheafternoon ofSeptember 14,when thetele-
phone rang inheroffice.“Amanfrom Minnesota,” said thevoice
ofhersecretary.
Shehadtoldhersecretary thatshewould accept allcalls ofthis
kind.They were theappeals forhelpandheronlysource ofinforma
tion.Atatimewhen thevoices ofrailroad officials uttered nothing
butsounds designed toavoid communication, thevoices ofnameless
menwere her lastlinktothesystem, thelastsparks olreason and
tortured honesty flashing briefly through themiles ofTaggart track.
“Miss Taggart, itisnotmyplace tocallyou, butnobody else
will,” said thevoice thatcame onthewire, thistime; thevoice
sounded young andtoocalm. “Inanother dayortwo, adisaster’s
going tohappen here thelikeotwhich they’ve never seen, andthey
won’t beable tohide itanylonger, only itwillbetoolatebythen,

“What isit?Who areyou?”
“One ofyouremployees oftheMinnesota Division, Miss Taggart.

“What didyousay?” She feltas ilminutes went bybetween the
words oftheunnatural voice thatdidnotsound likeherown.

Sheheard theclick. ‘"Thank you,” shesaidover adead wire.
The next time shenoticed theoffice around herandpermitted
herself tofeel, itwasnoon ofthefollowing day.Shestood inthe
middle oftheoffice, running stiff,spread fingers through astrand of
hair,brushing itback offherface—andforaninstant, shewondered
where shewasandwhat wastheunbelievable thing thathadhap-
pened inthe lasttwenty hours. What she fellwashorror, andshe
knew thatshehad felt itfrom the firstwords ofthemanonthe

There wasnotmuch thatremained inhermind ofthelasttwenty
hours, onlydisconnected bits, held together bythesingle constant

lought tohidefrom themselves thattheyknew theanswers tothe
questions sheasked.
From themoment when shewastold thatthemanager oftheCar
Service Department hadbeen outoftown toraweek andhad left
noaddress where onecould reach him—sheknew thatthereport of
themanfrom Minnesota was true.Thencame thefaces oftheassis-
tants intheCarService Department, whowould neither confirm the

ance ofasafely normal operation, without asingle cryofprotest to
arouse some braver man's attention, whohad falsified thereports,

'Ihrough thehours ofthat night -while asmall, desperate crew
under thecommand ofEddie Willers kept calling every division
point, every yard, depot, station, spurandsiding ofTaggart Trans-
continental forevery freight carinsight orreach, ordering them to
unload, drop, dump, scuttle anything andproceed toMinnesota at
once, while they kept calling theyards, stations andpresidents of
every railroad stillhalf inexistence anywhere across themap. beg-
861
ging forcars forMinnesota—shewent through thetaskoftracing
from face tocoward’s face thedestination ofthefreight cars that
hadvanished.
Shewentfrom railroad executives towealthy shippers toWashing-
ton officials andback totherailroad— bycab,byphone, bywire—
pursuing atrailofhalf-uttered hints. The trailapproached itsend
when sheheard thepinch-lipped voice ofapublic relations woman
inaWashington office, saying resentfully over thetelephone wire,
“Well, after all, itisamatter otopinion whether wheat isessential
toanation’s welfare—there arethose ofmore progressive viewswho
feelthatthesoybean is,perhaps, offargreater value”—andthen,
bynoon, shestood inthemiddle ofher office, knowing that the
freight carsintended forthewheat ofMinnesota hadbeen sent,
instead, tocarry thesoybeans from theLouisiana swamps ofKip’s
Mas project.
The firststory oftheMinnesota disaster appeared inthenewspa-
pers three days later. Itreported that thefanners whohadwaited
inthestreets ofLakewood forsixdays, withnoplace tostore their
wheat andnotrains tocarry it,haddemolished thelocal courthouse,
themayor’s home andtherailroad station. Then thestones vanished
abruptly andthenewspapers kept silent, thenbegan toprintadmoni-
tions urging people nottobelieve unpatriotic rumors.
While theHour mills and grain markets otthecountry were
screaming over thephones andthetelegraph wires, sending pleas to
NewYork anddelegations toWashington, while strings offreight
carsfromrandom corners ofthecontinent wcie crawling likerusty
caterpillars across themap inthedirection ofMinnesota—thewheat
andhope ofthecountry were wailing toperish along anempty track,
under theunchanging green light ofsignals that called formotion
totrains thatwere notthere.
Atthecommunication desks ofTaggart Transcontinental, asmall
crew kept calling forfreight cars, repeating, likethecrew ofasinking
ship, anS.O.S. thatremained unheard. There were freight carsheld
loaded formonths intheyards ofthecompanies owned bythe
friends ofpull-peddlers, whoignored thefrantic demands tounload
thecarsandrelease them. ‘Youcan tellthatrailroad to--" followed
byuntransmissible words, wasthemessage oftheSmather Brothers
ofArizona inanswer totheS.O.S. otNewYork.
InMinnesota, theywere seizing carsfrom every siding, from the
Mesabi Range, from theoremines ofPaul Larkin where thecats
hadstood waiting foradribble ofiron;They were pouring wheat
intoorecars, intocoal cars, intoboarded stock carsthatwent spilling

pouring wheat intopassenger coaches, oyer seats, racks and fixtures,

sideditches inthesudden crash ofbreaking springs, intheexplosions

They fought formovement, formovement withnothought ofdes
tination, formovement assuch, likeaparalytic under astroke, strug-
gling inwild, stiff, incredulous jerks against therealization that
movement wassuddenly impossible. There werenoother railroads:
862
James Taggart had killed them; there werenoboats ontheLakes:
PaulLarkin had killed them. There wasonly thesingle lineofrail
andanetofneglected highways.
'Thetrucks andwagons ofwaiting farmers started trickling blindly
down theroads, withnomaps, nogas,nofeed forhorses—moving
south, south toward thevision offlour mills awaiting them some-
where, withnoknowledge ofthedistances ahead, butwith the
knowledge ofdeath behind them—moving, tocollapse ontheroads,
inthegullies, inthebreaks ofrotted bridges. Onefarmer wasfound,
half amile south ofthewreck ofhistruck, lying dead inaditch,
facedown, stillclutching asackofwheat onhisshoulders. Then rain
clouds burst over theprairies ofMinnesota; therainwent eating the
wheat into rotatthewaiting railroad stations; itwenthammering
thepiles spilled along theroads, washing gold kernels intothe soil.
Themen inWashington wcie lasttobereached bythepanic.
They watched, notthenews from Minnesota, buttheprecarious
balance oftheir friendships andcommitments; theyweighed, notthe
fateoftheharvest, buttheunknowable result ofunpredictable emo-
tions inunthinking men ofunlimited power. They waited, they
evaded allpleas, they declared, “Oh, ridiculous, there's nothing to
worry about! Those Taggart people have always moved thatwheat
onschedule, lhe\T! findsomeway tomove it1”
Then, when theState Chief Executive ofMinnesota sent arequest
toWashington fortheassistance oftheArmy against theriotshe
wasunable tocontrol- three directives burst forth within twohours,
slopping alltrains inthecountry, commandeering allcars tospeed

Onthenight ofOctober 15,acopper wirebroke inNewYork
City, inanunderground control tower oftheTaggart Terminal, ex-
tinguishing thelights ofthesignals.m
Itwasonly thebreach ofonewire, but itproduced ashort circuit
intheinterlocking traffic system, andthesignals ofmotion ordanger
disappeared from thepanels ofthecontrol towers andfromamong
thestrands ofrail.Theredandgreen lenses remained redandgreen,
notwith theliving radiance ofsight, butwith thedead stare ofglass
eyes.Ontheedge ofthe city, acluster oftrains gathered atthe
entrance totheTerminal tunnels andgrew through theminutes of
stillness, likeblood damned byaclotinside avein, unable torush
intothechambers oftheheart.
Dagny, that night, was sitting atatable inaprivate dining room
oftheWayne-Falkland, Thewaxofcandles wasdripping down on
thewhite camellia andlaurel leaves atthebaseofthesilver candle-
sticks, arithmetical calculations were penciled onthedamask linen
tablecloth, andacigar buttwasswimming inalinger bowl.The six
men informal dinner jackets, facing herabout thetable, wereWesley
Mouch, Eugene Lawson, Dr.Floyd Ferris, Clem Weatherby, James
Taggart andCuffy Meigs.
"‘Why?" shehadasked, when Jimhadtoldherthatshehadtoattend
thatdinner. '‘Well ...because ourBoard ofDirectors istomeet next
week/’ “And?” “You’re interested inwhat’s going tobedecided about
ourMinnesota Line, aren't you?” “Isthatgoing tobedecided atthe
Board meeting?” “Well, notexactly”“Is itgoing tobedecided at
thisdinner?” “Not exactly, but . . .oh.whydoyoualways have to
besodefinite? Nothing's ever definite. Besides, they insisted that
theywanted youtocome.” “Why?” “Isn’t that sufficient?”
Shedidnotaskwhy thosemenchose tomake alltheir crucial
decisions atparlies ofthiskind; sheknew thatthey did.Sheknew

Itwasthe firsttime thattheyhadasked her.theoutsider, theenemy,
tooneofthose secret sessions: itwas,shethought, anacknowledg-
ment ofthefactthattheyneeded herand,perhaps the firststep ol
their surrender; itwasachance shecould notleave unlaken.
Butasshesatinthecandlelight olthedining room, she feltcertain
thatshehadnochance, she feltrestless!) unable toaccept that cer-
tainty, since shecould notgrasp itsreason, yetlethargically reluctant
topursue anyinquiry.
“As, lthink, you willconcede. Miss Taggart, therenowseems to

sure, agree that certain temporary retrenchments seem tobeindi

there aretimeswhen itisnecessary tosacrifice theparts forthesake
ofthewhole ..Asshelistened tothebicntions ofhername tossed
intotheconversation athalf-hour intervals, tossed perfunctorily, with
thespeaker’s eyes never glancing intyerdirection, shewondered
what motive hadmade them want her ftobepresent. Itwasnofan
attempt todelude herintobelieving th^ttheywere consulting her,
864
butworse: anattempt todelude themselves intobelieving thatshe
hadagreed. They asked herquestions attimes andinterrupted her
before shehadcompleted the firstsentence oftheanswer. They
seemed towant herapproval, without having toknow whether she
approved ornot.
Some crudely childish form ofself-deception hadmade them
choose togive tothisoccasion thedecorous setting ofaformal
dinner, they acted asiftheyhoped togain, from theobjects of
gracious luxury, thepower andthehonor olwhich those objects had
once been theproduct andsymbol—they acted, shethought, like
those savages whodevour thecorpse ofanadversary inthehope of
acquiring hisstrength and hisvirtue.
Sheregretted thatshewasdressed asshewas. ‘it's formal.” Jim
hadtold her,“but don't overdo it . . .what 1mean is,don’t look
toorich . . .business people should avoid anyappearance ofarro-
gance these days . . .notthatyoushould look shabby, but ifyou
could justseem tosuggest ..,well, humility ... itwould please
them, youknow, itwould make them feelbig.” “Really?” shehad
said, turning away.
Shewore ablack dress thatlooked asifitwerenomore than apiece
ofcloth crossed overherbreasts andfalling toherfeetinthesoftfolds
ofaGrecian tunic; itwasmade ofsatin, asatin solightandthinthat it
could have served asthestuffofanightgown. 1heluster ofthedoth,
streaming andshifting withhermovements, made itlook asifthelight

enttothemotions ofherbody, wrapping herinasheet ofradiance
more luxurious than thetexture ofbrocade, underscoiing thepliant

asabadge ofhonor. Sheworenoothei ornament, only thesweep ofa
black velvet cape,mote arrogantly, ostentatiously patrician thanany

Sheregretted itnow, asshelooked atthemen before her;she
felttheembarrassing guilt ofpointlessness, asifshehad tried to
defy thefigures inawaxworks. Shesawamindless resentment in
their eyesand asneaking trace otthe lifeless, sexless, smutty leer
withwhichmen look ataposter advertising burlesque.
“It’s agreat responsibility/* saidEugene Lawson, “tohold the
decision oflifeordeath over thousands ofpeople andtosacrifice
themwhen necessary, butwemust have thecourage todoit.”His
soft lipsseemed totwist intoasmile.
“The only factors toconsider areland acreage andpopulation
figures,” saidDr.Ferris inastatistical voice, blowing smoke rings at
theceiling. “Since itisnolonger possible tomaintain both theMin-
nesota Lineand thetranscontinental traffic ofthis railroad, the
choice isbetween Minnesota andthose states west oftheRockies
which were cutoffbythefailure oftheTaggart Tunnel, aswell as
865
theneighboring states ofMontana, Idaho, Oregon, which means,
practically speaking, thewhole oftheNorthwest. When youcompute
theacreage andthenumber ofheads inboth areas, it'sobvious
thatweshould scuttle Minnesota rather than giveupourlines of
communication over athird ofacontinent.'’
“Iwon’t giveupthecontinent," saidWesley Mouch, staring down
athisdishoficecream, hisvoice hurtandstubborn.
Shewasthinking oftheMesabi Range, the last otthemajor
sources ofiron ore,shewasthinking oftheMinnesota farmers, such
aswere leftofthem, thebestproducers ofwheat inthecountry—
shewasthinking thattheendotMinnesota would endWisconsin,
then Michigan, then Illinois—shewasseeing theredbreath ofthe
factories dying outover theindustrial East—asagainst theempty
miles ofwestern sands, ofstraggly pastures andabandoned ranches.
“The figures indicate," saidMr.Weatherby primly, “that thecon-
tinued maintenance ofboth areas seems tobeimpossible. The rail-
way track andequipment ofonehastobedismantled toprovide
thematerial forthemaintenance oftheother."
Shenoticed thatClem Weatherby, their technical expert onrail-
roads, was theinan ofleast influence among them, andOuffy
Meigs—ofmost. Cuffy Meigs satsprawled inhischair, with alook
ofpatronizing tolerance fortheirgame ofwasting timeondiscus-
sions.Hespoke little, butwhen hedid, itwas tosnap decisively,
with acontemptuous grin, “Pipe down. Jimmy1"or.“Nuts, Wes.
you’re talking through your hat!" vSlienoticed thatneither Jimnor
Mouch resented it.They seemed towelcome theauthority ofhis
assurance; theywere accepting himastheir master.
“We have tobepractical," Dr.Ferris kept saying. “Wehave to
bescientific."
“Ineed theeconomy ofthecountry asawhole," Wesley Mouch
kept repealing. “Ineed theproduction ofanation."
“Is iteconomics thatyou’re talking about? Isitproduction?" she
said,whenever hercold,measured voice wasable toseize abrief
stretch oftheir time. “If itis,then give usleeway tosave theEastern
states. That's allthat’s leftotthecountry -and oftheworld. Ifyou
letussave that, we’llhave achance torebuild the rest. Ifnot, it’s

SaveMinnesota. Save theEastern vSeaboard."
Itwasnouse.She said itasmany times, with asmany details,
statistics, figures, proofs, asshecould force outofherweary mind
intotheir evasive hearing. Itwasnouse.They neither refuted nor
agreed; they merely looked as ifherarguments were beside the
point. There was asound ofhidden emphasis intheir answers, asif
theywere giving heranexplanation, butinacode towhich shehad
nokey.
“There’s trouble inCalifornia," saidWesley Mouch sullenly.
“Their slate legislatuie's been acting pretty huffy. Theic’s talkof
seceding from theUnion."
“Oregon isoverrun bygangs ofdeserters," saidClem Weatherby
cautiously. “They murdered two taxcollectors within the lastthree
months"
“The importance ofindustry toacivilization hasbeen grossly over-
emphasized," saidDr,Ferris dreamily “What isnowknown asthe
People’s State ofIndia hasexisted forcenturies without anyindus-
trialdevelopment whatever."
“People could dowithfewer material gadgets and asterner disci-
pline ofprivations," saidEugene Lawson eagerly. “Itwould begood
lorthem"
“Oh hell, areyougoing toletthatdame talkyouinto letting the
nchest country onearth slipthrough your fingers?" saidCuffy Meigs,
leaping tohisfeet. “It’s afinetime togiveupawhole continent—
and inexchange forwhat? Foradinky little state that’s milked dry,
anyway! Isayditch Minnesota, butholdonto your transcontinental
dragnet. With trouble andtheriotseverywhere, youwon't beable
tokeep people inlineunless youhave transportation —troop trans-
portation- unless youholdyour soldiers within afewdays’ journey
ofanypoint onthecontinent. This isnotime toretrench. Don't get
yellow, listening toallthat talk.You've gotthecountry myour

“Inthelongrun--" Mouch started uncertainly
“Inthelong run, we’ll allbedead," snapped Cuffy Meigs.Hewas
pacing restlessly. “Retrenching, hell! There's plenty ofpickings left
inCalifornia andOregon and allthose places. What I’vebeen think-
ing is,weought tothink ofexpanding—theway things are,there's
nobody tostop us. it’sthere torthetaking—Mexico, andCanada
maybe—itought tobeacinch."
Then shesawtheanswer; shesawthesecret premise behind their
words With alloftheir noisy devotion totheageofscience, their
hysterically technological jargon, their cyclotrons, theirsound rays,
thesemenweremoved forward, notbytheimage ofanindustrial
skyline, butbythevision ofthatform ofexistence which theindustri-

Shehadthought that industrial production wasavalue nottobe
questioned byanyone; shehadthought that these men’s urge to
expropriate thefactories ofothers was theiracknowledgment ofthe
factories’ value. She,born oftheindustrial revolution, hadnotheld

Eugene Lawson, thehumanitarian, took pleasure attheprospect of
human starvation—andDr.Ferris, thescientist, wasdreaming ofthe
daywhenmenwould return tothehand-plow.
Incredulity andindifference were heronly reaction: incredulity,
because shecould notconceive ofwhatwould bringhuman beings
tosuch astate—indifference, because shecould notregard those

Hisroom, onthetopofanunderground tower, was likeaglass

most orderly stream intheworld- Hehadbeen trained tochart the
course ofover ninety trains anhourandtowatch them rollsafely
through amaze oftracks andswitches inandoutoftheTerminal,

waslooking outattheempty darkness ofadried channel.
Through theopendoor oftherelay room, shesawthetowermen
standing grimly idle—themenwhose jobshadnever permitted a
moment's relaxation—standing bythelongrows thatlooked like
vertical copper pleats, likeshelves ofbooks andasmuch ofamonu-
ment tohuman intelligence. The pull ofone ofthesmall levers,
which protruded likebookmarks from theshelves, threw thousands
ofelectric circuits intomotion, made thousands ofcontacts and
broke asmany others, setdozens ofswitches toclear achosen course
anddozens ofsignals tolight it,withnoerroi leftpossible, no

“We're going tomove trains andwe're going tomove them

"Manually?" saidthesignal engineer.
“Yes. brother! Nowwhyshould youbeshocked?” Shecould not

Shewasfighting todrown abitter voice thatseemed tobesaying:
That’s allthey’re fitfor,these men. ileven that . ..there’s nota
single mind leftanywhere onTaggart Transcontinental. ...
“Trains willcontinue tobemoved inandoutoftheTerminal.
You willremain atyour posts unlil—”
Then shestopped. Itwas hiseyesandhair thatshesawfirst— the
luthlessly perceptive eyes, thestreaks ofhaiishaded from gold to
topper thatseemed toreflect theglow ofsunlight inthemurk of
theunderground -shesawJohn Galtamong thechain gang ofthe
mindless, John Galt ingreasy overalls androlled shirt sleeves, she
saw hisweightless wayofstanding, hisface held lifted, hiseyes
looking atherasifhehadseen thismoment manymoments ago.
“What’s thematter. MissTaggart*”
Itwasthesottvoice ofthetower director, whostood byherside,
withsome sort ofpapermhishand—and shethought itwasstrange
toemerge from aspan ofunconsciousness which hadbeen thespan
ofthesharpest awareness shehadever experienced, only shedid
notknowhowlong ithadlasted orwhere shewasorwhy.Shehad
beenaware ofGait’s face, shehadbeen seeing, intheshape ofhis
mouth, intheplanes ofhischeeks, thecrackup ofthatimplacable
seienity which hadalways been his.buthe stillretained itinhis
look o!acknowledging thebreach, otadmitting that thismoment
wasloomuch even forhim.
Sheknew thatshewentonspeaking, because those around her
looked asiftheywere listening, though shecould nothearasound,
shewentonspeaking asifcarrying outahypnotic order given to
herself some endless time ago,knowing only thatthecompletion of
thatorder wasaform ofdefiance against him, neither knowing nor
hearing herownwords.
She feltmifshewere standing inaradiant silence where sight
washeronlycapacity and hisfacewas itsonly object, andthesight
873
ofhisfacewas likeaspeech intheform ofapressure atthebase
ofherthroat. Itseemed sonatural thatheshould behere, itseemed
sounendurably simple—she feltasiftheshock were nothispres-
ence, butthepresence ofothers onthetracks ofherrailroad, where
hebelonged andtheydidnot.Shewasseeing thosemoments aboard
atrainwhen, atitsplunge intothetunnels, shehad feltasudden,
solemn tension, asifthisplace wereshowing herinnaked simplicity
theessence ofherrailroad andofher life,theunion ofconsciousness
andmatter, thefrozen form ofamind's ingenuity giving aphysical
existence toitspurpose; shehad feltasense ofsudden hope, asif
thisplace heldthemeaning ofallofhervalues, andasense ofsecret
excitement, asifanameless promise were awaiting herunder the
ground—itwas right thatsheshould nowmeet him here, hehad
been themeaning andthepromise—shewasnotseeing hisclothing
anylonger, nortowhat level herrailroad hadleduccd him—shewas
seeing only thevanishing torture ofthemonths when hehadbeen
outside herreach—shewasseeing inhisfacetheconfession ofwhat
those months hadcosthim—theonlyspeech sheheard wasasifshe
were saying tohim;Tins isthereward for allmydays—andasifhe
were answering: For allofmine.
Sheknew thatshehad finished speaking tothestrangers when
shesaw thatthelower director hadstepped forward andwassaying
something tothem, glancing atalistinhishand. Then, drawn bya
sense olirresistible certainty, shefound herself descending thestairs,
slipping away from thecrowd, nottoward theplatforms andtheexit,
butintothedarkness oftheabandoned tunnels. You willfollow me,
shethought—and feltasifthethought were notmwords, but inthe
tension ofhermuscles, thetension ofherwilltoaccomplish athing
sheknew tobeoutside herpower, vetsheknew with certainty that
itwould beaccomplished andbyherwish .. .no,shethought, not
byherwish, butby itstotal rightness. You willfollow me—itwas
neither pleanorprayer nordemand, hutthequiet statement ola
fact, itcontained thewhole ofherpower ofknowledge andthe
whole oftheknowledge shehadearned through theyears.You will
follow me, ifwearewhatweare,youand 1,ifwelive, iftheworld
exists, ifyouknow themeaning ofthismoment andcan’t let itslip
by,asothers let itslip, into thesenselessness oftheunwilled and
unreached. You willfollowme—she feltanexultant assurance, which
wasneither hope nor faith, butanactofworship forthelogic of
existence.
Shewashurrying down theremnants ofabandoned rails,down
thelong, dark corridors twisting through granite. She lostthesound
ofthedirector’s voice behind her.Then she feltthebeat ofher
arteries andheard, inanswering rhythm, thebeat ofthecityabove
herhead, butshe feltasifsheheard th4motion ofherblood asa
sound filling thesilence, andthemotion ofthecityasthebeat inside
herbody—and, farbehind her,sheheatd thesound ofsteps. She
didnotglance back. Shewent faster.{
Shewent past thelocked irondoorwhere theremnant ofhis
motor was stillhidden, shedidnotstop, |>utafaintshudder washer
answer tothesudden glimpse oftheunityandlogic intheevents of
874
thelasttwoyears.Astring ofblue lights wentonintothedarkness,
over patches ofglistening granite, overbroken sandbags spilling
driftsonthe rails, over rusty piles ofscrap metal.When sheheard
thestepscoming closer, shestopped andturned tolook back.
Shesawasweep ofblue light flash briefly ontheshining strands
ofGalt's hair,shecaught thepale outline ofhisfaceandthedark
hollows ofhiseyes.The facedisappeared, butthesound ofhissteps
served asthelink lothenext blue light thatswept across theline
ofhiseyes, theeyes thatremained held level, directed ahead—and
she feltcertain thatshehadstayed inhissightfrom themoment he
hadseenheratthetower.
Sheheard thebeatofthecityabove them—these tunnels, shehad
once thought, were theroots ofthecityandofallthemotion reach-
ingtothesky— butthey, shethought, John Galtandshe,were the
living power within these roots, theywere thestartandaimand
meaning— he,too,shethought, heard thebeatofthecityasthebeat
ofhisbody.
Shethrew hercape back, shestood defiantly straight, ashehad
seen herstand onthesteps ofthetower— ashehadseen herfor
thefirstlime, tenyears ago,here,under theground—shewashearing
thewords ofhisconfession, notaswords, butbymeans ofthat
heating which made itsodifficult tobreathe: Youlooked like a
symbol ofluxury andyoubelonged intheplace thatwas its
source . ..youseemed tobring theenjoyment oflifeback loits
rightful owners , ..youhad alook ofenergy andofitsreward,
together . . .and 1wasthe firstmanwhohadever stated inwhat
manner these twowere inseparable. .. .
Thenextspan ofmoments was likeflashes oflight instretches of
blinded unconsciousness —themoment when shesaw hisface, ashe
stopped beside her.when shesawtheunaslomshed calm, theleashed
intensity, thelaughter ofunderstanding inthedarkgreen eyes—the
moment when sheknew what hesaw inheiface,bythetight,drawn
harshness ofhislips—themoment when she felthismouth onhers,
when she felttheshape ofhismouth both asanabsolute shape and
asaliquid filling herbody—then themotion ofhislipsdown the
lineofherthroat, adrinking motion that leftatrailofbruises—
then thesparkle ofherdiamond clipagainst thetrembling copper
othishair.
Then shewasconscious ofnothing butthesensations ofherbody,
because herbody acquired thesudden power loletherknow her
mostcomplex values bydirect perception. Justashereyeshadthe
power totranslate wave lengths ofenergy into sight, justasherears
hadthepower totranslate vibrations intosound, soherbodynow
hadthepower totranslate theenergy thathadmoved allthechoices
ofher life,intoimmediate sensory perception. Itwasnotthepressure
ofahand thatmade hertremble, buttheinstantaneous sumofits
meaning, theknowledge that itwashishand, that itmoved asifher
fleshwere hispossession, that itsmovement was hissignature of
acceptance under thewhole ofthatachievement which washerself—
itwasonlyasensation ofphysical pleasure, but it,contained her,
worship ofhim,ofeverything thatwashisperson andhislife—from
875
thenight ofthemassmeeting inafactory inWisconsin, totheAtlan-
tisofavalley hidden intheRocky Mountains, tothetriumphant
mockery ofthegreen eyes ofthesuperlative intelligence above a
worker’s figure atthefoot ofthetower—itcontained herpride in
herself andthat itshould beshewhom hehadchosen ashismirror,
that itshould beherbody which wasnow giving himthesumofhis
existence, ashisbody wasgiving herthesumofhers.These were
thethings itcontained—butwhat sheknew wasonly thesensation
ofthemovement ofhishand onherbreasts.
Hetore offhercapeandshe felttheslenderness ofherownbody
bymeans ofthecircle ofhisarms, asifhisperson were onlyatool
forhertriumphant awareness ofherself, butthat selfwere only a
tool forherawareness ofhim. Itwas asifshewere reaching the
limit ofhercapacity tofeel, yetwhat she feltwas like acryof
impatient demand, which shewasnowincapable ofnaming, except
that ithadthesame quality ofambition asthecourse ofher life,
thesame inexhaustible quality ofradiant greed.
Hepulled herhead back loramoment, tolook straight intoher
eyes, tolethersee his,toletherknow the fullmeaning oftheir
actions, asifthrowing Ihespotlight ofconsciousness uponthem for
themeeting oftheir eyes inamoment ofintimacy greater than the
onetocome.
Then shefeltthemesh ofbuilap striking theskinofhershoulders,
shefound herself lying onthebroken sandbags, shesawthelong,
tightgleam ofherstockings, she felthismouth piessed toherankle,
then rising inatortured motion upthelineofherleg,asifhewished
toown itsshape bymeans ofhislips,thenshe feltherteeth sinking
intotheflesh ofhisarm. she feltthesweep ofhiselbow knocking
herhead aside and hismouth seizing her lipswith apressure more
viciously painful than hers—thenshe felt,when ithitherthroat, that
which sheknew only asanupward streak ofmotion that released
andunited herbody intoasingle shock ofpleasure— thensheknew
nothing butthemotion ofhisbodyandthedriving greed Ihatwent
reaching onandon,asifshewere notaperson anylonger, only a
sensation ofendless reaching fortheimpossible —then sheknew that
itwas possible, andshegasped and lay still,knowing thatnothing
more could bedesired, ever.
Helaybeside her,onhisback, looking upatthedarkness ofthe
granite vault above them, shesawhimstretched onthejagged slant
ofsandbags asifhisbodywere fluid inrelaxation, shesawtheblack
wedge ofhercape flung across the rails attheir feet, there were
beads ofmoisture twinkling onthevault, shifting slowly, running
into invisible cracks, likethe lights of ;tdistant traffic. When he

There wasasudden glint ofhardness inhiseyes, ashesatupand

“No!” Thecrywasimmediate—inanswer totheflashofasudden

“True, it’sjustalittlelonger— not tillyouwin.but tillyoulearn"

“Iwillremain here, onmyjob,” hesaid.“But don't trytosee

Sheinclined herhead insilent promise.
Butwhen heturned togo,asudden shudder ranthrough her

itended inaninvoluntary cry:“Where i$reyougoing?”
“Tobealamppost andstand holding^ lantern tilldawn—which

Sheseized hisarm, tohold him, tofollow, tofollow him blindly,
abandoning everything butthesight ofhisface.“John!”
Hegripped herwrist, twisted herhandandthrew itoff.“No,”
hesaid.

Then hetookherhandandraised ittohislipsandthepressure
ofhismouth wasmore passionate astatement thananyhehad

abandoning heratthesame time.
When shestaggered outintotheconcourse oftheTerminal, the
firstblast ofrolling wheels went shuddering through thewalls ofthe
building, likethesudden beatofaheart thathadstopped. Thetem-
pleofNathaniel Taggart was silent andempty, itschangeless light
beating down onadeserted stretch ofmarble. Some shabby figures
shuffled across it,asiflost initsshining expanse. Onthesteps of
thepedestal, under thestatue oftheaustere, exultant figure, aragged
bum satslumped inpassive resignation, likeawing-plucked birdwith
noplace togo,resting onanychance cornice.
She felldown onthesteps ofthepedestal, likeanother derelict,

Itseemed toheronly thatshekept seeing afigure with araised

Chapter V!THECONCERTO OFDELIVERANCE
OnOctober 20.thesteelworkers' union otRearden Steeldemanded
araise inwages.
Hank Rearden learned itfrom thenewspapers: nodemand had
been presented tohimand ithadnotbeen considered necessary to
inlorni him.Thedemand wasmade totheUnification Board; itwas
notexplained whynoother steelcompany waspresented with a
similar claim. Hewasunable totellwhether thedemanders didor
didnotrepresent hisworkers, theBoard’s rulesonunion elections
having made itamatter impossible todefine. Helearned only that
thegroup consisted ofthosenewcomers whom theBoard hadslipped
into hismills inthepastfewmonths.
OnOctober 23,theUnification Board rejected theunion's peti-
tion.ietusing togiant theraise. Itanyhearings hadbeen heldonthe
matter, Rearden hadnotknown about it.Hehadnotbeen consulted,
informed 01notified. Hehadwaited, volunteering noquestions.
OnOctober 25,thenewspapers ofthecountry, controlled bythe
samemenwhocontrolled theBoard, began acampaign ofcommiser-
ation with theworkers ofRearden Steel.They printed stories about
lherefusal ofthewage raise, omitting anymention ofwhohad re-
fused itorwhoheld theexclusive legalpower torefuse, asifcount-
ingonthepublic toforget legal technicalities under abarrage of
stories implying thatanemployer wasthenatural cause ofallmiser-
881
iessuffered byemployees. They printed astory describing thehard-
ships oftheworkers ofRearden Steel under thepresent rise inthe
cost oftheir living—next toastory describing Hank Rearden’s
profits, offiveyears ago.They printed astoryontheplight ofa
Rearden worker’s wife trudging from store tostore inahopeless
quest forfood—next toastory about achampagne bottle broken
oversomebody’s head atadrunken party given byanunnamed steel
tycoon atafashionable hotel: thesteeltycoon hadbeenOrren Boyle,
butthestory mentioned nonames, inequalities still existamong
us,” thenewspapers were saying, “and cheat usofthebenefits of
ourenlightened age.” “Privations haveworn thenerves andtemper
ofthepeople. The situation isreaching thedanger point.Wefear
anoutbreak ofviolence/’ “We fearanoutbreak ofviolence,” the
newspapers kept repeating.
OnOctober 28,agroup ofthenewworkeis atRearden Steel
attacked aforeman andknocked thetuyeres offablast furnace. Two
days later, asimilar group broke theground-floor windows ofthe
administration building Anewworker smashed thegears ofacrane,
upsetting aladle ofmolten metal within ayard offivebystanders.
“Guess Iwent nuts,worrying aboutmyhungry kids/' hesaid,when
arrested. “This isnotime totheorize about who’s right orwrong,”
thenewspapers commented. “Our soleconcern isthe fact thatan
inflammatory situation isendangering the steel output ofthe
country.”
Rearden watched, asking noquestions. Hewaited, asifsome final
knowledge were intheprocess ofunraveling before him, aprocess
nottobehastened orstopped. No—hethought through theearly
dusk ofautumn evenings, looking outthewindow ofhisoffice—no.
hewasnotindifferent tohismills; butthefeeling which hadonce
been passion foraliving entity wasnow likethewistful tenderness
one feels forthememory oftheloved anddead.The special quality
ofwhatone feels forthedead, hethought, isthatnoaction ispossi
bleanylonger.
Onthemorning ofOctober 31,hereceived anotice informing
himthat allofhisproperty, including hisbank accounts andsafety
deposit boxes, hadbeen attached tosatisfy adelinquent judgment
obtained against him inatrialinvolving adeficiency inhispersonal
income taxofthree years ago. Itwas aformal notice, complying
withevery requirement ofthelaw—except thatnosuch deficiency
hadever existed andnosuch trialhadevertaken place.
“No,” hesaid tohisindignation-choked attorney, “don’t question
them, don’t answer, don't object.” “But this isfantastic!” “Any more
fantastic than therest?” “Hank, doyouwantmetodonothing? To
take itlyingdown?” “No, standing up.Afid Imean, standing. Don’t
move. Don’t act.”“But they’ve leftyouhelpless.” “Have they?” he
asked softly, smiling. *
Hehadafewhundred dollars incash,* left inhiswallet, nothing
else.Buttheodd,glowing warmth inhfcmind, likethefeelofa
distant handshake, wasthethought that inasecret safeofhis
bedroom there layabarofsolid gold, given tohimbyagold-

Next day,onNovember 1,hereceived atelephone callfromWash-
ington, from abureaucrat whose voiceseemed tocome sliding down
thewireonitsknees inprotestations ofapology. “Amistake, Mr.
Rearden! Itwasnothing butanunfortunate mistake! That attach-
mentwasnotintended foryou.Youknowhow itisnowadays, with

cessed theattachment order against you—when itwasn’t your case
atall, itwas, infact, thecase ofasoap manufacturer! Please accept
ourapologies, Mr.Rearden, ourdeepest personal apologies atthe

Rearden ...?”“I’m listening.” “1can’t tellyouhow sorryweare

“Iheard you.” “We’re desperately sorry andready tomake any

Lateonthenext afternoon, another voice came pleading from
Washington. Thisonedidnotseem toslide, buttobounce onthe
telephone wirewith thegayvirtuosity ofatighl-rope walker. Itintro-
duced itself asTinky Holloway andpleaded thatRearden attend a
conference, “aninformal little conference, justalewofus,thetop-
level few.” tobeheld inNew York, attheWayne-Falkland Hotel,
dayafter next.
“There have been somany misunderstandings inthepastfew
weeks!” saidTinky Holloway. “Such unfortunate misunderstandings^-
andsounnecessary! Wecould straighten everything out inajiffy,
Mr.Rearden, ifwehadachance tohavealittle talkwithyou.We're
extremely anxious toseeyou.”
“You canissue asubpoena formeanytimeyouwish.”
“Oh. no!no!no!”Thevoice sounded frightened. “No,Mr.Rear-
den—whythink ofsuch things? Youdon’t understand us,we’re anx-
ious tomeetyouonafriendly basis, we’re seeking nothing butyour
voluntary co-operation.” Holloway paused tensely, wondering
whether hehadheard thefaintsound ofadistant chuckle; hewaited,
butheard nothing else.“Mr.Rearden?”
“Yes?”
“Surely, Mr.Rearden, atatime like this, aconference with us
could betoyour great advantage.”
“Aconference—about what?”
“You’ve encountered somany difficulties—andwe're anxious to
helpyou inanywaywecan.”
“Ihave notasked forhelp.”
“These areprecarious times, Mr.Rearden, thepublicmood isso
uncertain andinflammatory, so . . .dangerous ...andwewant to
beable toprotect you.”
883
“Ihave notasked forprotection.''
“But surely yourealize thatwe’re inaposition tobeofvalue to
you,and ifthere's anything youwantfrom us,any...”
“There isn't,”
“Butyoumusthaveproblems you’d liketodiscuss with us.”
“Ihaven't.”
“Then ...well,then”—giving uptheattempt attheplayofgrant-
ingafavor, Holloway switched toanopenplea— “then won tyou
justgiveusahearing?”
“Ifyouhave anything tosaytome.”
“We have, Mr.Rearden. wecertainly have! That's allweTe asking
for—ahearing. Just giveusachance. Justcome tothisconference.
Youwouldn’t becommitting yourself toanything—"Hesaid itinvol-
untarily. andstopped, hearing abright, mocking staboflifeinRear-
den’s voice, anunpromising sound, asRearden answered:
“1know it.”
“Well, 1mean ...that is .well, then, willyoucome?”
“All right,” saidRearden. “I’llcome.”
Hedidnotlisten toHolloway’s assurances ofgratitude, henoted
only thatHolloway kept repeating. “Atseven p.m,November fourth,
Mr.Rearden . . .November fourth . ..”asifthedatehadsome

Rearden dropped thereceiver and layback inhischair, looking
attheglow offurnace flames ontheceiling olhisoffice Heknew
that theconference wasatrap: heknew also thathewaswalking
into itwithnothing foranytrappers togam.
Tinky Holloway dropped thereceiver, inhisWashington office,
and satuptensely, frowning. Claude Slagenhop, president ofFriends
ofGlobal Progress, whohad satinanarmchair, nervously chewing
amatchstick, glanced upathimandasked, “Not sogood?”
Holloway shook hishead. “He’ll come, but . .no,notsogood”
Headded, “1don’t think he’ll take it.”
“That’s whatmypunk toldme.”
“Iknow.”
“The punk saidwe’d better not tryit.”
“Goddamn your punk! We’ve gotto!Well have torisk it!”
Thepunk was Philip Rearden who,weeks ago,hadreported to
Claude Slagenhop: “No, hewon’t letme in,hewon’t givemeajob.
I've tried, asyouwanted me to.I've tried niybest, but it’snouse,

you’re notofmuch help,” Slagenhop hadj&aid dryly, turning away.
Philip hadseized hissleeve andasked, his-voice shrinking suddenly
intoopen anxiety, “Say, Claude . . .according to ...toDirective

hadsnapped, “ofwhat useareyou touswithout himV’
Onthemorning ofNovember 4,Hank Rearden wasawakened by
theringing ofthetelephone. Heopened hiseyes tothesight ofa
dear, pale sky,theskyofearlydawn, inthewindows ofhisbedroom,
askythedelicate color ofaquamarine, with the first rays ofan
invisible sungiving ashade ofporcelain pink toPhiladelphia’s an-
cient roof tops.Foramoment, while hisconsciousness hadapurity
toequal thesky’s, while hewasaware otnothing buthimself and
hadnotyetreharncssed hissoul totheburden ofalien memories,
helay still,heldbythesightandbytheenchantment ofaworld to
match it,aworld where thestyle ofexistence would beacontinu-
ousmorning.
Thetelephone threw himback into exile-
itwasscreaming at
spaced intervals, likeanagging, chronic cryforhelp, thekindofcry
thatdidnotbelong inhisworld Helifted thereceiver, frowning.
“Hello?”
“Good morning, Henry.” saidaquavering voice; itwas hismother.
“Mother—atthishour?” heasked dryly.
“Oh, you’re always upatdawn, and Iwanted tocatch youbefore
youwent totheoffice.”
“Yes? What isit?”
“I’ve gottoseeyou. Henry, I'vegottospeak toyou.Today.
Sometime today. It’simportant.”
“Has anything happened?”
“No ...yes .. .that is . . .I’vegottohave atalkwithyou in

“Fm sorry, Ican’t. Ihave anappointment inNewYork tonight.
Ifyouwantmetocome tomorrow—’’
“No! No,nottomorrow. It'sgottobetoday. It’sgotto.”There
wasadimtone ofpanic inhervoice, but itwasthestale panic of
chronic helplessness, notthesound otanemergency—except foran
oddecho offear inhermechanical insistence.
“What isit.Mother?”
“1can’t talkabout itover thetelephone. I’vegottoseeyou.”
“Then ifyouwish tocome totheoffice—”
“No!Not attheoffice! I’vegottoseeyoualone, where wecan

“AH right. Mother. I’llbethere atfour o’clock thisafternoon.”

“That will foefine,Henry, Thank you,Henry. That will foefine."
Itseemed tohim thatthere was atouch oftension intheairof

Hewalked slowly upthepathtoward thedoor.He feltnoemo-

Hehadexpected toseehismother and Philip; hehadnotexpected
thethird person who rose, asthey did, athisentrance intotheliving

Hestopped onthethreshold. They stood looking athisfaceand
attheopen door behind him.Their faces had alook offearand
cunning, thelook ofthatblackmail-through virtue which hehad
learned tounderstand, asiftheyhoped togetaway wilh itbymeans
ofnothing buthispity, toholdhimtrapped, when asingle stepback
could takehimoutottheir reach.
They hadcounted onhispityanddreaded hisanger; theyhadnot
dared consider thethird alternative: hisindifference
“What isshedoing here?" heasked, turning tohismother, his
voice dispassionately flat.
“Lillian’s been living hereever since your divorce," sheanswered
defensively. “Icouldn’t letherstarve onthecitypavements, could
i?"
Thelookmhismother's eyeswashalt-plea, asifshewere begging
himnottoslapherface, half-triumph, asifshehadslapped his.He
knew hermotive: itwasnotcompassion, there hadnever beenmuch
lovebetween Lillian and her, itwas theircommon revenge against
him, itwasthesecret satisfaction ofspending hismoney ontheex-
wifehehadrefused tosupport
Lillian’s headwaspoised tobow ingreeting, with thetentative
hintofasmileonher lips, half-timid, half^brash. Hedidnotpretend
toignore her;helooked ather, asifhe^were seeing her fully, yet
asifnopresence were being registered inhismind.Hesaidnothing,
closed thedoorandstepped intotheroom.
Hismother gave asmall sighofuneasy reliefanddropped hastilym.
intothenearest chair, watching hint,nervously uncertain ofwhether
hewould follow herexample.
"What was ityouwanted?” heasked, sitting down.
Hismother saterectandoddly hunched, hershoulders raised, her
head half-lowered. "Mercy. Henry.” shewhispered.
"What doyoumean?”
"Don’t youunderstand me?”
"No.”
"Well”—shespread herhands inanuntidily fluttering gesture of
helplessness —"Well ...”Hereyesdarted about, struggling toescape
hisattentive glance. "Well, there aresomany things tosayand . ,
and Idon’tknowhowtosaythem, but . . .well, there’s onepractical
matter, but it’snotimportant hvitself it'snotwhy 1called

"What isit?”
"The practical matter? Ourallowance checks™ -Philip’s andmine.
It’sthe first ofthemonth, butonaccount ofthatattachment order,
thechecks couldn’t come through. Youknow that, don't you?”
"Iknow it.”
"Well, what arewegoing todo?”
"1don’t know.”
"Imean, what areyougoing todoabout it?”
"Nothing”
Hjsmother satstaring athim, as itcounting theseconds ofsilence.
Nothing, Henry?"
"1havenopower todoanything”
They were watching hisfacewith akindofsearching intensity: he
(eltcertain that htsmothei had toldhimthetruth, thatimmediate
financial worry wasnottheir purpose, that itwasonly thesymbol
ofamuch wider issue.
"But, Henry, we’re caught short.”
"Sowas I.”
"But can'tyousend ussome cashorsomething*"
"They gavemenowarning, notune togetanycash.”
‘Then . . .Look, Henry, thething wassounexpected, itscared
people.1guess -ihegrocery store refuses togive uscredit, unless

"1willnot."
"You won’t?" Shechoked onasmall gasp."Why?”
"1willnotassume obligations that 1can tfulfill.”
"What doyoumean?”
"Iwillnotassume debts 1havenowayofrepaying.”
‘What doyoumean, noway? JTiatattachment isonlysome sort
oftechnicality, it'sonlytemporary, everybody knows that!”
"Dothey? Idon’t.”
"But, Henry—agrocery bill!You’re notsure you'll beable topay
agrocery bill,you,with allthemillions youown?”
T’m notgoing todefraud thegrocer bypretending that Iown
those millions.’*
"What areyoutalking about? Whoownsthem?”
887
“Nobody.”
“What doyoumean?”
.“Mother* Ithink youunderstand mefully. Ithinkyouunderstood
itbefore Idid.There isn’tanyownership leftinexistence orany

wanted me tied. I’m tied.Now it’stoo late toplayanygames
about it.”
“Are yougoing toletsome political ideas ofyours—”Shesaw
thelookonhisfaceandstopped abruptly.
Lillian satlooking down atthefloor, asifafraid toglance upat
thismoment. Philip satcracking hisknuckles.
Hismother dragged hereyes into focus again andwhispered,
“Don’t abandon us,Henry.” Some faint staboflife inhervoice told
him thatthe lidofherrealpurpose wascracking open. “These are
terrible times, andwe’re scared. That's thetruth of it,Henry, we’re
scared, because you’re turning away from us.Oh, Idon'tmean just
thatgrocery bill,butthat’s asign—ayearagoyouwouldn't have let
thathappen tous.Now . . .nowyoudon't care.” Shemade an
expectant pause. “Doyou?”
“No.”
“Well . . .well, 1guess theblame isours. That’s what 1wanted
totellyou— thatweknow we’re toblame.Wehaven’t treated you
right, allthese years We've been unfair toyou.we've made you
suffer, we’ve usedyouandgiven younothanks inreturn. We’re
guilty, Henry, we’ve sinned against you,andwcconfess it.What
more canwesaytoyounow? Willyou find itinyour heait to
forgive us?”
“What isityouwantmetodo?” heasked, inthedear, flattone
ofabusiness conference.
“Idon’t know!Whoam Itoknow? Butthat’s notwhat I’mtalking
ofrightnow.Notofdoing,
only offeeling. It’syour feeling thatI’m
begging you for,Henry—justyour feeling—even ifwedon’t deserve
it.You’re generous and strong. Willyoucancel thepast,Henry?
Willyouforgive usf>”
Thelook ofterror inhereyeswas real.Ayear ago.hewould
have toldhimself that thiswasherwayofmaking amends; hewould
havechoked hisrevulsion against herwords, words which conveyed
nothing tohimbutthefogofthemeaningless; hewould have vio-
lated hismind togivethem meaning, even ifhedidnotunderstand;
hewould have ascribed toherthevirtue ofsincerity inherown
terms, even iftheywere not his.Buthewasthrough with granting
respect toanyterms other than hisown.
“Will youforgive us?”
“Mother, itwould bebestnottospeal^ ofthat. Don’t pressme
totellyouwhy. Ithink youknow ita,4well as 1do. Ifthere’s
anything youwant done, tellmewhat i^is.There’s nothing else
todiscuss.” t
“But Idon't understand you! fdon’t! That’s what lcalled you
here for—toaskyour forgiveness! Areyougoing torefuse toan-
swerme?”
“Very well.What would itmean,myforgiveness?”
888 -
“Uh?”
“Isaid,whatwould itmean?”
Shespread herhands outinanastonished gesture toindicate the
self-evident. “Why, it... itwould make usfeelbetter.”
“Will itchange thepast?”
“Itwould make usfeelbetter toknow thatyou’ve forgiven it.”
“Doyouwishmetopretend thatthepasthasnotexisted?”
“OhGod,Henry, can’tyousee? Allwewant isonly toknow that
you ...thatyou feelsome concern forus.”
“Idon’t feel it.Doyouwishmetofake it'*”
“But that’s what I’mbegging you for—tojeel it!”
“Onwhatground?”
“Ground?”
“Inexchange forwhat?”
“Henry, Henry, it’snotbusiness we’re talking about, notsteel
tonnages andbank balances, it'sfeelings— andyou talk like a
trader!”
“Iamone.”
What hesaw inhereyeswas terror—notthehelpless terror of
struggling and failing tounderstand, buttheterror ofbeing pushed
toward theedgewhere toavoid understanding would nolonger be
possible.
“Look. Henry,” said Philip hastily. “Mother can’t understand
those things.Wedon’tknowhow toapproach youWecan’t speak
your language.”
“fdon’t speak youis”
“What she’s trying tosay isthatwe’re sorry We’re terribly sorry
thatwe've hurt you.You think we're notpaying tor it.butweare.
We're suffering remorse.”
ThepainmPhilip's facewas real.Ayear ago,Reardon would
have feltpity.Now. heknew' thattheyhadheldhimthrough nothing
buthisreluctance tohurtthem, hisfearoftheir pain.Hewasnot
afraid of itanylonger.
“We’re soriy, Henry.Weknow we’ve harmed you.Wewishwe
could atone for it.Butwhat canwcdo?Thepast ispast.Wecan’t
undo it.”
“Neither can l.”
“You canaccept ourrepentance,” said Lillian, inavoice glassy
with caution. “Ihave nothing togainfromyounow. 1onlywantyou
toknow thatwhatever I’vedone, Lvedone itbecause lloved you.”
Heturned away, without answering.
“Henry!” cried hismother. “What’s happened toyou? What's
changed you likethat?You don’tseem tobehuman anymore!You
keep pressing usforanswers, whenwehaven’t anyanswers togive.
Youkeep beating uswith logic—what’s logic atatime like this?—
what’s logicwhen people aresuffering?*’
“We can’t help it!”cried Philip.
“We’re atyourmercy,” said Lillian.
Theywerethrowing their pleas ataface thatcould notbereached.
They didnotknow—andtheir panic wasthelastoftheir struggle to
escape theknowledge—that hismerciless sense ofjustice, which had
889
been their onlyholdonhim,which hadmade himtakeanypunish-
ment andgivethem thebenefit ofevery doubt, wasnow turned
against them— thatthesame force thathadmade him tolerant, was
now theforce thatmade himruthless—thatthejustice which would
forgive miles ofinnocent errors ofknowledge, would notforgive a
single steptaken inconscious evil.
“Henry, don’t youunderstand us?" hismother waspleading.
“Ido,”hesaid quietly.
Shelooked away, avoiding theclarity ofhiseyes.“Don’t youcare
whatbecomes ofus?"
“Idon't,"
"Aren't youhuman?" Hervoice grew shrill with anger. "Aren’t
youcapable ofanylove atall? It'syour heart I'mtrying toreach,
notyourmind! Love isnotsomething toargue andreason andbar-
gain about! Itssomething togive!Tofeel!OhGod, Henry can't

"1never have."
Inamoment, hervoicecame back, lowanddioning: "We’re not

Itwasnotasound thatstopped her, itwasonly amovement ol
hiseyebrows, thebrief, swiftmovement ofacheck mark.Then they
sawrhim smile; thenature ofthesmile wasthemost terrifying ol
answers.
"So that's what you’re afraid of,"hesaidslowly.
"You can’t quit!" hismother screamed inblind panic. "You can't
quitnow!Youcould have, fastyear, butnotnow!Nottoday! You
can’t turn deserter, because now they take itoutonyour family!
They’ll leave uspenniless, they'll sei/e everything, they’ll leave us
tostarve, they'll—"
"Keep still!" cried Lillian, more adept than theothers atreading
danger signs inRearden's face.
Hisfaceheld theremnant ofasmile, addtheyknew thathewas
notseeing them anylonger, but itwas ndjt intheirpower toknow
why hissmilenowvseemed tohold painand|an almost wistful longing,
orwhyhewaslooking across theroom.* attheniche ofthe far-
thestwindow.
Hewasseeing afinely sculptured faceheldcomposed under the
lashing ofhisinsults, hewashearing av^ice thathadsaid tohim-
quietly, here, inthisroom: "It isagainst diesinofforgiveness that
Iwanted towarn you,"Youwhohadknown itthem hethought . .
buthedidnot(hush thesentence inhismind, heletitend inthe
890
bitter twist ofhissmile, because heknew what hehadbeen about
tothink:Youwhohadknown itthen—forgive me.
There itwas— hethought, looking athisfamily— thenature of
their pleas formercy, thelogic ofthose feelings theysorighteously
proclaimed asnon-logical—there wasthesimple, brutal essence of
allmenwho speak ofbeing able tofeelwithout thought andof
placing mercy over justice.
Theyhadknown what tofear; theyhadgrasped andnamed, before
hehad,theonlywayofdeliverance leftopen tohim;theyhadunder-
stood thehopelessness ofhisindustrial position, the futility ofhis
struggle, theimpossible burdens descending tocrush him; theyhad
known that inreason, injustice, insell-preservation, hisonlycourse
wastodrop itallandrun— yettheywanted tohold him, tokeep
him inthesacrificial furnace, tomake him letthem devour thelast
ofhim inthename ofmercy, forgiveness andbroiher-canmbal love.
"Ifyou stillwantmetoexplain it,Mother,*' hesaidvery quietly,
“ilyou’re stillhoping that Iwon't becruelenough toname what
vou’re pretending nottoknow, then here's what's wrong withyour
ideaofforgiveness: You regret thatyou've huitmeand, asyour
atonement for it,youaskthat 1offei myself tototalimmolation.”
“Logic!” shescreamed. "There yougoagain withyourdamn logic!

Herose tohisteet.
‘Wait! Don’t go!Henry, don’t abandon us!Don’t sentence usto

"Why. no--” hestarted inquiet astonishment andended inquiet
hoiror, asthethought struck him fully."Idon't think youdo. Ifyou
did,youwould haveknown how tovalueme”
As ifinsilent proof andanswer, Philip’s lacewent slowly intoan
expression intended asasmile ofamusement, yetholding nothing
butfearandmalice. “You won't beable toquitandrunaway.” said
Philip. “You can’t runaway without money.”
Itseemed tostrike itsgoal.Rearden stopped short, thenchuckled.
"Thanks, Philip.” hesaid.
”Uh?” Philip gave anervous jerkofbewilderment.
“So that’s thepurpose oftheattachment order. That's what your
friends areafraid of. Jknew theywere getting settospring some-
thingonmetoday. 1didn’t know thattheattachment wastheir idea
otcutting offescape.” Heturned incredulously tolook athismother.
"And that'swhyyouhadtoseemetoday/before theconference in
NewYork.”
‘Mother didn’t know it1”cried Philip, then caught himself and
cried louder. “1don'tknow what you’re talking about! Ihaven’t said
anything! Ihaven't said it!”Hisfearnowseemed tohavesomemuch
lessmystic andmuch more practical quality.
’Don’t worry, youpoor little louse, lwon't tellthem thatyou've
toldmeanything. And ifyouwere trying—”
Hedidnot finish; helooked atthethree faces before him,anda
sudden smile ended hissentence, asmile ofweariness, ofpity, of
incredulous revulsion. Hewasseeing thefinal contradiction, thegro-
tesque absurdity attheendoftheirrationahsls’ game; themen in
891
Washington hadhoped toholdhimbyprompting these three totry
fortheroleofhostages.
“You think you're sogood, don’t you?” Itwasasudden cryand
itcame from Lillian; shehadleaped toherfeettobarhisexit; her
facewasdistorted, ashehadseen itonce before, onthatmorning
when shehadlearned thename ofhismistress. “You’re sogood!
You’re soproud ofyourself! Well, /havesomething totellyou!”
Shelooked asifshehadnotbelieved until thismoment thather
game was lost.The sight ofherface struck him like alastshred
completing acircuit, and insudden clarity heknew what hergame
hadbeenandwhyshehadmarried him.
Iftochoose aperson astheconstant center ofone’s concern, as
thefocus ofone’s view oflife,wastolove—hethought—then itwas
true thatsheloved him; but if,tohim, lovewasacelebration of
one’s selfandofexistence—then, totheself-haters and life-haters,
thepursuit ofdestruction wastheonlyformandequivalent oflove.
Itwasforthebestofhisvirtues that Lillian hadchosen him, forhis
strength, hisconfidence, hispride—shehadchosen him asone
chooses anobject oflove, asthesymbol ofman’s living power, but
thedestruction ofthatpower hadbeen hergoal.
Fiesawthem astheyhadbeen attheir firstmeeting: he,theman
ofviolent energy andpassionate ambition, theman ofachievement,
lighted bytheflame ofhissuccess andflung intothemidst ofthose
pretentious asheswho called themselves anintellectual elite, the
burned-out remnants ofundigested culture, feeding ontheafterglow
oftheminds ofothers, offering their denial ofthemind astheir only
claim todistinction, andacraving tocontrol theworld astheir only
lust—she,thewoman hanger-on ofthat elite, wearing theirshopworn
sneer asheranswer totheuniverse, holding impotence assuperiority
andemptiness asvirtue—he.unaware oftheir hatred, innocently
scornful oftheir posturing fraud—she,seeing him asthedanger to
their world, asathreat, asachallenge, asareproach.
The lustthatdrives others toenslave anempire, hadbecome, in
her limits, apassion forpower over him.Shehad setouttobreak
him, asif,unable toequal hisvalue, shecould surpass itbydestroy-
ing it,asifthemeasure ofhisgreatness would thusbecome the
measure ofhers, asif—hethought with ashudder—asifthevandal

Heremembered herhammering derision ofhiswork, hismills, his

“Ihave something totellyou!” cried Lillian, with thesound of

“You’re soproud ofyourself, aren’t you? You’re soproud ofyour

The feelofthesteering wheel under bishands andofthesmooth
highway streaming past, ashesped toNew York, hadanoddly
bracing quality. Itwasasense ofextreme precision andofrelaxation,
together, asense ofaction without strain, which seemed inexplicably
youthful— tintilherealized that thiswasthewayhehadacted and
hadexpected always toact,inhisyouth—andwhathenow feltwas
likethesimple, astonished question; Why should oneeverhave to
actinanyother manner?
Itseemed tohim that theskyline ofNew York, when itrose
before him,hadastrangely luminous clarity, though itsshapes were
veiled bydistance, aclarity thatdidnotseem torest intheobject,
but feltasiftheillumination camefrom him.Helooked atthegreat

Hepaused inthe silent corridor oftheWayne-Falkland. atthe

tolifthishand andknock: itwasthesuite thathadbelonged to
Francisco d’Anconia.
There were coils ofcigarette smoke weaving through theanof
thedrawing room, among thevelvet drapes andbare, polished tables.
With itscostly furniture andtheabsence ofallpersonal belongings,
theroom had that airofdreaiy luxury which pertains totransient
occupancy, asdismal astheairofaflophouse. Five figures rose in
thefogathisentrance: Wesley Mouch. Eugene Lawson, James Tag-
gart, Dr.Floyd Ferris andaslim, slouching manwholooked likea
rat-faced tennis player andwas introduced tohim asTinky
Holloway.
‘"All right,” saidRearden, cutting offthegreetings, thesmiles, the
offers ofdrinks andthecomments onthenational emergency, “what
didyouwant?”
“We're here asyour friends, Mr.Rearden,” saidTinky Holloway,
“purely asyour friends, foraninformal conversation with aview to
closer mutual teamwork.”
“We’re anxious toavail ourselves ofyour outstanding ability,”
saidLawson, “and your expert advice onthecountry’s industrial
problems.”
“It’smen likeyouthatweneed inWashington,” saidDr.Ferris.
“There’s noreason whyyoushould haveRemained anoutsider for
solong,when your voice isneeded att^etop level ofnational
leadership.”
The sickening thing about it,thought ?Rearden, was that the
speeches were only half-lies; theother half, }ntheirtoneofhysterical-
urgency, wastheunstated wish tohave itsomehow betrue.“What
didyouwant?” heasked.«
“Why . .«tolisten toyou,Mr.Rearden,” saidWesley Mouch, the
894
jerkofhisfeatures imitating afrightened smile; thesmilewasfaked,
thefearwas real.“We ...wewant thebenefit ofyour opinion on
thenation’s industrial crisis,”
“1have nothing tosay.”
“But, Mr,Rearden,” saidDr.Ferris, “allwewant isachance to
co-operate withyou.”
*Tve toldyouonce, publicly, that Idon’t co-operate atthepoint
ofagun.”
“Can’t webury thehatchet atatime like this?” saidLawson
beseechingly.
“The gun?Goahead.”
“Uh?”
“It’syouwho’re holding it.Bury it, ifyouthink youcan.”
“That . ..thatwas just afigure ofspeech,” Lawson explained,
blinking. “1wasspeaking metaphorically.”
“Iwasn’t.”
“Can’t we allstand together forthesake ofthecountry inthis
hour ofemergency?” saidDr.Ferris. “Ca n’twedisregard ourdiffer-
ences ofopinion? We’re willing tomeet youhalfway. Ifthere's any

“Cut it,boys. Ididn't corne here tohelpyoupretend thatI'mnot

spring onthesteel industry. What isiC”
“Asamatter offact,” saidMouch, “wedohave avitalquestion

“We don't want tospring anything onyou,” saidHolloway. “We
asked youhere todiscuss itwithyou.”
“1came here totake orders. Give them.”
“But, Mr.Rcarden, wedon’t want tolook atitthatwayWedon’t
want togiveyouorders.Wewant your voluntary consent.”
Rcarden smiled. “1know it.”
“You do?”Holloway started eagerly, butsomething about Rear-
den’s smilemade him slide into uncertainty. “Well, then—”
“And you,brother,” saidRcarden, “know that that istheflaw in
yourgame, thefatal flaw that willblast itsky-high. Nowdoyou tell
mewhat clout onmyhead you're working sohard nottoletme
notice— ordo lgohome?”
“Oh no,Mr.Rcarden!” cried Lawson, with asudden dartofhis
eyes tohiswrist watch. “You can't gonow!— That is, Imean, you
wouldn’t want togowithout hearing whatwchave tosay.”
“Then letmehear it.”
Hesawthem glancing atoneanother. Wesley Mouch seemed
afraid toaddress him;Mouch’s faceassumed anexpression ofpetu-
lantstubbornness, like asignal ofcommand pushing theothers for-
ward; whatever their qualifications todispose ofthefateofthesteel
industry, theyhadbeen brought here toactasMouch’s conversa-
tional bodyguards. Rearden wondered about thereason forthepres*
895
ence ofJanies Taggart; Taggart satingloomy silence, sullenly sipping
adrink, never glancing inhisdirection.
“We haveworked outaplan,” said Dr.Ferris toocheerfully,
“which willsolve theproblems ofthesteel industry andwhich will
meet withyour fullapproval, asameasure providing forthegeneral
welfare, while protecting your interests andinsuring your safety in
a—”
“Don’t trytotellmewhatFmgoing tothink. Givemethefacts.”
“It isaplanwhich isfair,sound, equitable and—”
“Don’t tellmeyour evaluation. Givemethefacts”
“It isaplanwhich—”Dr.Ferris stopped; hehad lostthehabit
ofnaming facts.
“Under thisplan,” saidWesley Mouch. “we willgrant theindustry
afivepercent increase intheprice ofsteel.”Hepaused triumphantly.
Reardcn saidnothing.
“Ofcourse, some minor adjustments willbenecessary,” saidHol-
loway airily, leaping into the silt*neeasonto avacant tennis court.
“Acertain increase inprices willhave tobegranted totheproducers
ofironore—oh,three percent atmost— -inview oftheadded hard-
ships which some ofthem. Mr.Larkin ofMinnesota, forinstance,
willnowencounter, inasmuch asthey’ll have toship their orebythe
costly means oftrucks, since Mr.James Taggart hashad tosacrifice
hisMinnesota branch Imetothepublic welfare. And, ofcourse, an
increase mfreight rates willhave tobegranted tothecountry’s
railroads—let's say,seven percent, roughly speaking— inview ofthe
absolutely essential need tor—”
Holloway stopped, likeaplayer emerging from awhirlwind activ-
itytonotice suddenly thatnoopponent wasanswering hisshots.
“But there willbenoincrease inwages,” saidDr.Ferris hastily
“An essential point oftheplan isthatwewillgrant noincrease in
wages tothesteel workers, mspile oftheir insistent demands. We
dowish tobefairtoyou. Mr.Rearden, and toprotect your inter-
ests—even attheriskofpopular resentment andindignation."
“Ofcourse, ifweexpect labor tomake asacrifice,” saidLawson,
“wemustshowthem thatmanagement, too, ismaking certain sacri-
fices forthesake ofthecountry. Themood oflabor inthesteel
industry isextremely tense atpresent, Mr.Reardcn, itisdangerously
explosive and ...and inorder toprotect youfrom . . .from ...”
Hestopped,
“Yes?” saidRearden. “From?”
“From possible . . .violence, certain measures arcnecessary,
which ...Look, Jim”--he turned suddenly} toJames Taggart— “why
don’t youexplain ittoMr.Rearden. asajfellow industrialist?”
“Well, somebody’s gottosupport theraSroads,” saidTaggart sul-
len^ notlooking athim.“The country nfeds railroads andsome-
body’s gottohelp uscarry theload,and if;wedon’t getanincrease
infreight rates—”
“No, no,no!”snapped Wesley Mouch. !Tell Mr.Rearden about*
theworking oftheRailroad Unification Plan.”
“Well, thePlan isafullsuccess,” saidT&ggart lethargically, “ex-
cept forthenotfully controllable element oftime. Itisonlyaques-
8%
tionoftimebefore ourunified teamwork putsevery railroad inthe
country backonitsfeet.ThePlan,Pminaposition toassure you,
would work assuccessfully foranyother industry.”
“Nodoubt about that,” saidRcarden, andturned toMouch. “Why
doyouaskthestooge towastemytime? What hastheRailroad
Unification Plan todowithme?”
“But, Mr.Rearden,” criedMouch with desperate cheerfulness,
“that’s thepattern we’re tofollow! That’s whatwecalled youhere
todiscuss!”
“What?”
“The Steel Unification Plan!”
There wasaninstant ofsilence, asofbreaths drawn afteraplunge.
Rearden satlooking atthem with aglance thatseemed tobea
glance ofinterest.
“Inview ofthe critical plight ofthesteel industry,” saidMouch
with asudden rush, as ifnottogive himself time toknow what
made himuneasy about thenature otReardon’s glance, “and since
steel isthemost vitally, crucially basic commodity, thefoundation
ofourentire industrial structure, drastic measures must betaken to
preserve thecountry’s steel-making facilities, equipment andplant.”
Thetoneandimpetus ofpublic speaking carried himthat farandno
farther. “With thisobjective inview, ourPlan is .. .ourPlan is . ..”
“Our Plan isreally very simple,” saidTinky Holloway, striving to
prove itbythegailybouncing simplicity ofhisvoice. “Well liftall
restrictions from theproduction ofsteel andevery company will
produce all itcan,according toitsability. Buttoavoid thewaste
anddanger ofdog-eat-dog competition, allthecompanies willde-
posit their gross earnings into acommon pool, tobeknown asthe
Steel Unification Pool, incharge ofaspecial Board. Attheendof
theyear, theBoard will distribute these earnings bytotaling the
nation’s steel output anddividing itbythenumber ofopen hearth
furnaces inexistence, thus arriving atanaverage which willbefair
toall—andevery company willbepaid according toitsneed.The
preservation ofitsfurnaces being itsbasic need, everycompany will
bepaidaccording tothenumber offurnaces itowns.”
Hestopped, waited, then added. “That’s it,Mr.Rearden,” and
getting noanswer, said.“Oh, there’s alotofwrinkles tobeironed
out,but ...butthat’s it.”
Whatever reaction theyhadexpected, itwasnottheonetheysaw.
Rearden leaned back inhischair, hiseyes attentive, butfixedon
space, asiflooking atanottoodistant distance, thenheasked, with
anoddnoteofquietly impersonal amusement, “Will you tellmejust
onething, boys, what isityou’re counting on?"
Heknew thatthey understood. Hesaw,ontheir faces, thatstub-
bornly evasive lookwhich hehadonce thought tobethelook ofa
liarcheating avictim, butwhich henowknew tobeworse: thelook
ofaman cheating himself ofhisown consciousness. They didnot
answer. Theyremained silent, asifstruggling, nottomakehimforget
hisquestion, buttomake themselves forget thattheyhadheard it.
“U's asound, practical Plan!” snapped James Taggart unexpect-
897
edly, withanangry edge ofsudden animation inhisvoice. “Itwill
work! Ithastowork!Wewant ittowork!”
Nooneanswered him.
“Mr,Rearden . ..?”saidHolloway timidly.
“Well, letmesee,” saidRearden. “Orren Boyle’s Associated Steel
owns 60open-hearth furnaces, one-third ofthem standing idleand
therestproducing anaverage of3<X)tons ofsteel perfurnace pei
day. Iown20open-hearth furnaces, working atcapacity, producing
750tons ofRearden Metal perfurnace perday.Soweown80

anaverage of337.5 tonsperfurnace. Eachdayoftheyear, Iproduc-
ing15,000 tons, willbepaid for6,750 tons. Boyle, producing 12,000
tons, willbepaid for20,250 tons.Never mind theothermembers of
thepool, theywon’t change thescale, except tobring theaverage
stilllower, most ofthem doing worse than Boyle, none ofthem
producing asmuch as I.Nowhow longdoyouexpect melolast
under your Plan?”
There wasnoanswer, thenLawson cried suddenly, blindly, righ-
teously, “Intime ofnational peril, itisyour duty toserve, sutler
andwork forthesalvation ofthecountry!”
“Idon’t seewhypumping myearnings intoOtren Boyle's pocket
isgoing tosave thecountry.”
“You have tomake certain sacrifices tothepublic welfare!”
“Idon't seewhyOrren Boyle ismore 'thepublic than Iam.”
“Oh, it’snotaquestion ofMr.Boyle atall! It’smuch wider than
anyoneperson. It'samatter ofpreserving thecountry’s natural
resources— such asfactories—andsaving thewhole ofthenation's
industrial plant.Wecannot permit theruinofanestablishment as
vast asMr.Boyle’s. Thecountry needs it.”
“Ithink,” saidRearden slowly, “that thecountry needsmemuch
more than itneeds Orren Boyle”
“Bqt ofcourse!” cned Lawson with startled enthusiasm. “The
country needs you,Mr.Rearden! Youdorealize that, don't you?”
ButLawson’s avidpleasure atthefamiliar formula ofself-immola-
tion,vanished abruptly atthesound ofRearden's voice, acold, trad-
er’svoice answering: “1do.”
“It’s notBoyle alone who’s involved,” saidHolloway pleadingly.
“The country’s economy would notbeable tostand amajor disloca-
tion atthepresent moment. There arethousands ofBoyle’s workers,
suppliers andcustomers. What would happen tothem ifAssociated
Steel went bankrupt?”
“What willhappen tothethousands ofmyworkers, suppliers and
customers when /gobankrupt?”;
“Vow, Mr.Rearden?” saidHolloway incredulously. “But you’re
therichest, safest andstrongest industrialist inthecountry atthis
moment!”
“What about themoment after next?”
“Uh?”
“How longdoyouexpect metobeable toproduce ataloss?”
“Oh, Mr,Rearden, Ihavecomplete faith inyou!”
“To hellwithyour faith!Howdoyouexpectmetodoit?”
RQR
“You’ll manage!”
“How?”
There wasnoanswer.
44Wecan’t theorize about thefuture,” criedWesley Mouch, “when
there’s animmediate national collapse toavoid! We’ve gottosave
thecountry’s economy! We’ve gottodosomething!” Rearden ’sim-
perturbable glance ofcuriosity drove him toheedlessness. “Ifyou
don’t like it,doyouhave abetter solution tooffer?”
“Sure*” saidRearden easily, ifit’sproduction thatyouwant, then
getoutoftheway,junk allofyourdamn regulations, letOrren
Boyle gobroke, letmebuytheplant ofAssociated Steel—and it
willbepouring athousand ions adayfrom every oneofitssixty

“Oh, but . . .butwecouldn’t!” gasped Mouch. “That would be
monopoly!”
Reaiden chuckled. “Okay." hesaid indifferently, “then letmy
mills superintendent buy it.He’lldoabetter jobthan Boyle.”
“Oh, butthatwould beletting thestrong have anadvantage over
theweak!Wecouldn’t dothat!”
“Then don’t talkabout saving thecountry’s economy,”
“Allwewant is—”Hestopped.
“Allyouwant isproduction without menwho're able toproduce,
isn't it?”
“That . ..that’s theory. That’s just atheoretical extreme. Allwe
want isatemporary adjustment."
“You've been making those temporary adjustments foryears.
Don't youseethatyou've runoutoflime?”
“That’s justtheo ..Hisvoice trailed offandstopped.
“Well, now, look here,” saidHolloway cautiously, “it's notasif
Mr.Boyle were actually . . .weak. Mr.Boyle isanextremely able
man. It’sjust that he’s suffered some unfortunate reverses, quite
beyond hiscontrol. Hehadinvested largesums inapublic-spirited
project toassist theundeveloped peoples ofSouth America, andthat
copper crash oftheirs hasdealthimasevere financial blow. Soit’s
onlyamatter ofgiving him achance torecover, ahelping hand to
bridge thegap, abitoftemporary assistance, nothing more. Allwe
have todo isjustequalize thesacrifice— theneverybody willrecover
andprosper.”
“You’ve been equalizing sacrifice forover ahundred”—hestopped—
“forthousands ofyears.” saidRearden slowly. “Don’t yousecthat
you're attheendoftheroad?”
“That’s justtheory!” snapped Wesley Mouch.
Rearden smiled. “Iknow7your practice.” hesaid softly. “It’syour
theory (hatI’mtrying tounderstand.”
Heknew thatthespecific reason behind thePlanwasOrren Boyle;
heknew thattheworking ofanintricate mechanism, operated by
pull, threat, pressure, blackmail—amechanism likeanirrational add-
ingmachine runamuck andthrowing upanychance sum atthe
whim ofanymoment—hadhappened toadduptoBoyle’s pressure
upon thesemen toextort forhim this lastpiece ofplunder. Heknew
alsothatBoyle wasnotthecause ofitortheessential toconsider,

thatBoyle wasonly achance rider, notthebuilder, oftheinfernal
machine thathaddestroyed theworld, that itwasnotBoyle who
hadmade itpossible, noranyofthemen inthisroom. They, too,
were only riders onamachine without adriver, theywere trembling
hitchhikers whoknew that their vehicle wasabout tocrash into its
final abyss—and itwasnotloveorfearofBoyle thatmade them

vSaying: 1cangetaway with it.Why?—hethought. Whydothey think
theycan?
“We can't afford anytheories!" cried Wesley Mouch. “We've got
toact!”
“Well, then. I’llofferyouanother solution. Why don't youtake
overmymillsandbedone with it?"
The joltthatshook them wasgenuine terror.
“Ohno!"gasped Mouch.
“We wouldn’t think ofit!"cried Holloway.
“We stand forfreeenterprise!" cried Dr.Ferris.
“We don’t want toharm you!'’ criedLawson. “We’re your friends,
Mr.Rearden. Gin’tweallwork together? We're your friends."
There, across theroom, stood atable with atelephone, thesame
table, most likely, andthesame instrument— andsuddenly Rearden
feltasifhewere seeing theconvulsed figure ofamanbent over
thattelephone, amanwhohadthenknown what he,Rearden, was
nowbeginning tolearn, aman fighting torefuse himthesame re-
quest which hewasnow refusing tothepresent tenants ofthis
room—hesawthefinish ofthat fight, aman’s tortured face lifted to
confront himand adesperate voice saying steadily: “Mr. Rearden,
lswear toyou...bythewoman 1love . ..that 1amyour friend."
Thiswastheacthehadthen called treason, and thiswastheman
hehadrejected inorder togoonserving themenconfronting him
now.Who, then, hadbeen thetraitor?—hethought; hethought it
almost without feeling, without right tofeel, conscious ofnothing
butasolemnly reverent clarity. Whohadchosen togive itspresent
tenants themeans toacquire thisroom?Whom hadhesacrificed
andtowhose profit?
“Mr. Rearden!" moaned Lawson. “What’s thematter?"
Heturned hishead, sawI-awson’s eyeswatching himfearfully and
guessed what lookLawson hadcaught inhisface.
“We don’t want toseize your mills!" cri&iMouch.
“We don’twant todeprive youofyourproperty!" cried Dr.Ferris.
“You don’t understand us!"
“I’m beginning to.”
Ayear ago,hethought, theywould have&shot him;twoyears ago.
theywould have confiscated hisproperty; generations ago,men of
theirkindhadbeen abletoafford theluxury ofmurder andexpropri-.
atioit, thesafety ofpretending tothemselves and their victims that
material lootwas their only objective. Bui their timewasrunning
outandhisfellow victims hadgone, gone sooner thananyhistorical

“Look, boys,” hesaidwearily, “Iknow whatyouwant.Youwant

“Idon’tknow whatyoumean,” saidMouchmaninjured tone of

“Defeatist? Doyoureally expect metobeable loremain inbusi-

“But it’sonlytemporary!”
“There isnosuch thing asatemporary suicide”
“But it’sonly fortheduration oftheemergency! Only until the

“How doyouexpect ittorecover1”
There wasnoanswer.
“How doyouexpect metopioducc after Igobankrupt?”
“You won’t gobankrupt. You'll always produce,” saidDr.Ferris
indifferently, neither inpraise nor inblame, merely inthetone of
staling afactofnature, ashewould have said toanother man: You'll
always beabum.“You can't help HIt's inyour blood. Or,tobe
more scientific, you’re conditioned thatway.”
Rcarden satup: itwas asifhehadbeen struggling tofindthe
secret combination ofalockand felt, atthose words, afaint click
within, asofthe firsttumbler falling inloplace
“It’s only amatter ofweathering this crisis” saidMouch, “of
giving people areprieve, achance tocatch up.”
“And then?”
“Then things willimprove.”
“How?”
There wasnoanswer.
“What willimprove them?”
There wasnoanswer.
“Who willimprove them?”
“Christ, Mr.Rearden, people don’t juststand still!” cried Hoi
loway. “They dothings, theygrow, theymove forward!”
“What people?”
Holloway waved hishand vaguely. “People,” hesaid.
“What people? Thepeople towhom you’re going tofeed thelast
ofRearden Steel, without getting anything inreturn? Thepeople
who’ll goonconsuming more than theyproduce?”
“Conditions willchange.”
“Who’ll change them?”
There wasnoanswer
“Have youanything lefttoloot? Ifyoudidn’t seethenature of

They didnotanswer. They didnotlook athim.Their faceswore
expressions ofstubborn resentment, asifhiswere theplea otaliar.
Then Lawson said softly, half inreproach, half inscorn, “Well,
after all,youbusinessmen have kept predicting disasters toryears,
you’ve cried catastrophe atevery progressive measure and told us
thatwe’il perish—butwehaven't.” Hestalled asmile, butdiew back
from thesudden intensity ofReardon's eyes.
Rearden had feltanother click inhismind, thesharper click of
thesecond tumbler connecting thecircuits ofthelock.Heleaned
forward. “What areyoucounting on?” heasked; histone had

Then—even though itwasonly asentence hehadheard allhis

pleting thesumandreleasing theintricate lock, theanswer uniting
allthepieces, thequestions andtheunsolved wounds ofhis life.
Inthemoment ofsilence after thecrash, itseemed tohim that
heheard Francisco’s voice, asking him quietly intheballroom of
thisbuilding, yetasking italsohereandnow:“Who istheguiltiest
man inthisroom?” Heheard hisownanswer ofthepast: “Isup-
pose—Janies Taggart?” andFrancisco svoice saying without re-
proach: “No, Mr.Rearden, it’snotJames Taggart.”— buthere, in
thisroom and thismoment, hismind answered: “1am”

“What’s thematter, Mr.Rearden7What have Isaid?” Taggart
wasasking with rising anxiety—buthewasoutofthereach ofTag-

Hewasseeing theprogression oftheyears, themonstrous extor-
tions, theimpossible demands, theinexplicable victories ofevil, the
preposterous plans andunintelligible goals proclaimed involumes of

thatsome complex, malevolent wisdom wasmoving thepowers de-

Hewasreaching lorhishatandcoat,when henoticed thatthe
men intheroom were trying tostophim, that their faceshadalook
ofpanic andtheir voices were crying inbewilderment: "‘What's the
matter, Mr.Rearden? .. .Why? .* .Butwhy? ...What havewe
said? ...You’re notgoing! . ..You can’t go! . ..It'stooearly! ...
Not yet!Oh,notyet!”
He feltas ifhewere seeing them from therearwindow ofa
speeding express, asiftheystood onthetrack behind him,waving
theirarms infutile gestures andscreaming indistinguishable sounds,
their figures growing smaller inthedistance, their voices fading.
Oneofthem tried tostophimasheturned tothedoor.Hepushed

immobility within him. as ifpossessing knowledge, hecould now

Hewasaware ofthelong,empty road streaming, then curving,
thenstreaming straight before hirn, oftheeffortless pressure ofhis
hands onthewheel andthescreech ofthetiresonthecurves. But
hefeltasifhewere speeding down askyway suspended andcoiling
inempty space.
Thepassers-by atthefactories, thebridges, thepower plants along

expensively powerful cardriven byaconfident man. with theconcept
ofsuccess proclaimed more loudly thanbyany electric sign, pro-
claimed bythedriver’s garments, byhisexpert steering, byhispur-
poseful speed. They watched himgopastandvanish intothehaze
equating earth with night.
Hesawhismills rising inthedarkness, asablack silhouette against
abreathing glow.Theglowwasthecolor ofburning gold,and“Rear-
denSteel” stood written across thesky inthecool, white fireol

Helooked atthelong silhouette, thecurves ofblast furnaces
standing liketriumphal arches, thesmokestacks rising likeasolemn

hanging likegarlands, thecranes saluting HlCclances, thesmoke wav-
ingslowly like flags.The sightbroke thestillness within himandhe
smiled ingreeting, ftwasasmile ofhappiness, oflove, ofdedication.
Hehadnever loved hismills ashedidin|hatmoment, for—seeing
them byanactofhisown vision, cleared cIfallbuthisowncode of
values, inaluminous reality that heldn$contradictions —hewas-
seeing thereason ofhislove: themillswete anachievement ofhis

world wasgone, ifhismillshadceased toserve hisvalues— then the
millswere onlyapileofdead scrap, tobelefttocrumble, thesooner
thebetter—* tobeleft,notasanactoftreason, butasanactof
loyalty totheir actual meaning.
The mills were stillamileahead when asmall spurt otflame
caught hissudden attention. Among alltheshades offireinthevast
spread ofstructures, hecould telltheabnormal andtheout-of-place:
thisonewastoorawashade ofyellow and itwasdarting from a
spotwhere nofirehadreason tobe,from astructure bythegateof
themain entrance.
Inthenext instant, heheard thedrycrack ofagunshot, then three
answering cracks inswift succession, likeanangry hand slapping a
sudden assailant.
Then theblack mass barring theroad inthedistance took shape,
itwasnotmere darkness and itdidnotrecede ashecame closer—
itwasamobsquirming atthemain gate, trying tostorm thenulls.
Hehadtime todistinguish waving arms, some with clubs, some
withcrowbars, some with rifles—theyellow flames ofburning wood
gushing from thewindow ofthegatekeeper’s office— thebluecracks
ofgunfire darting outofthemobandtheanswers spitting from the
roof otthestructures- -hehadtime toseeahuman figure twisting
backward and falling from thetopofacar—thenhesent hiswheels
intoashrieking curve, turning intothedarkness ofasideroad.
Hewasgoing attherateofsixty miles anhourdown therutsof
anunpaved soil,toward theeastern gale otthemills—andthegate
was insightwhen theimpact oftiresonagully threw thecaroff

pitted against twotons olspeeding metal, thecurve othisbody

sweeping itbackonto theroadandinto thecontrol ofhishands. It
hadtaken one instant, but inthenext hisfootwentdown onthe

headlights hadswept theravine, hehadglimpsed anoblong shape,
darker than thegray oftheweeds ontheslope, and ithadseemed to
himthatabrief while blurhadbeen ahuman handwaving forhelp.
Throwing offhisovercoat, hewent huirying down thesideofthe
ravine, lumps ofearth giving wayunder hisleet,hewent catching
atthedried coils ofbrush, half-running, half-sliding toward thelong
black form which hecouldnow distinguish tobeahuman body.A
veum ofcotton wasswimming against themoon, hecould seethe
white ofahand and theshape otanarm lying stretched inthe
weeds, butthebody lay still, withnosignofmotion.
SiMr.Rearden
Itwasawhisper struggling tobeacry, itwastheterrible sound
ofeagerness fighting against avoice thatcould benothing buta
moan ofpain.
Hedidnotknow which came first, itfeltlikeasingle shock: his
thought that thevoice was familiar, arayofmoonlight breaking
through thecotton, themovement offalling down onhisknees bythe
white ovalofaface,andtherecognition. ItwastheWetNurse.

Hefelttheboy’s hand clutching hiswith theabnormal strength
ofagony, while hewasnoticing thetortured lines oftheface, the
drained lips,theglazing eyesandthethin,dark trickle from asmall,
black hole intoowrong, tooclose aspotonthe leftsideofthe
boy's chest.

ofdustonknees andstomach, scrambled with theneedles ofburs.

Rearden hadtolower himgently back totheground.

“No, notanymore. You’re afullabsolute now,andyouknow it.”
“Yes. Iknow several ofthem, now. There’s one”— hepointed at
thewound inhischest— “that’s anabsolute, isn’t it?And”— hewent
onspeaking while Rcarden was lifting himfrom theground byim-
perceptible seconds andinches, speaking asifthetrembling intensity
ofhiswords were serving asananesthetic against thepain—“and

“Yes, Tony, that’s anabsolute”
Reardon rose tohisfeetbyalong, cautious effort; hesaw the
tortured spasm oftheboy’s features, ashesettled himslowly against
hischest, likeababy held tight inhisarms—butthespasm twisted
intoanother echo oftheimpudent grin,andtheboyasked, “Who's
theWetNurse now?”
“Iguess Iam.”
Hetook the first steps uptheslant ofcrumbling soil, hisbody
tensed tothetask ofshock absorber forhisfragile burden, tothe
taskofmaintaining asteady progression where therewasnofoothold
tofind.
Theboy’s headdropped onReardon's shoulder, hesitantly, almost
asifthiswere apresumption. Rcarden bentdown andpressed his
lipstothedust-streaked forehead.
Theboyjerked back, laising hishead with ashock ofincredulous,
indignant astonishment. “Doyouknow what youdid?” hewhis-
pered, asifunable tobelieve that itwasmeant forhim.
“Put yourheaddown,” saidRcarden, “and I'lldo itagain.”
Theboy’s headdropped andRcarden kissed hisforehead; itwas
likeafather’s recognition granted toason’s battle.
Theboy lay still, hisfacehidden, hishands clutching Rearden’s
shoulders. Then, withnohintofsound, withonly thesudden beat
offaint, spaced, rhythmic shudders toshow it,Rearden knew that
theboywascrying— crying insurrender, inadmission ofallthe
things which heamid notputintothewoids hehadnever found.
Rcarden went onmoving slowly upward, stepbygroping step,
fighting forfirmness ofmotion against theweeds, thedrifts ofdust,
thechunks ofscrap metal, therefuse ofadistant age.Hewent on,
toward thelinewhere theredglow ofhismillsmarked theedge ofthe
pitabove him, hismovement afierce struggle thathad totake the
form ofagentle, unhurried flow.
Heheard nosobs, buthefelttherhythmic shudders, and,through
thecloth ofhisshirt, inplace oftears, hefeltthesmall, warm, liquid
spurts flungfrom thewound bytheshudders. Heknew thatthetight
pressure ofhisarms wastheonlyanswer which theboywasnow
able tohearandunderstand— andheheld thetrembling body asif
thestrength ofhisarms could transfuse some partofhisliving power
intothearteries beating ever fainter against him.
909
Then thesobbing stopped andtheboyraised hishead. Hisface
seemed thinner andpaler, buttheeyeswere lustrous, andhelooked
upatRearden, straining forthestrength tospeak.
“Mr.Rearden ... I... Iliked youverymuch.”
“Iknow it.”
The boy's features hadnopower toform asmile, but itwas a
smile thatspoke inhisglance, ashelooked atRearden ’sface—as
helooked atthatwhich hehadnotknown hehadbeen seeking
through thebriefspan ofhislife,seeking astheimage ofthatwhich
hehadnotknown tobehisvalues.
Then hishead fellback, andthere wasnoconvulsion inhisface,
only hismouth relaxing toashape ofserenity— butthere wasabrief
stabofconvulsion inhisbody, likealastcryofprotest—andRear-
denwentonslowly, notaltering hispace, eventhough heknew that
nocaution wasnecessary anylonger because what hewascarrying
inhisarms wasnow thatwhich hadbeen theboy’s teachers' idea
ofaman—acollection ofchemicals.
Hewalked, asifthiswere hisform oflast tribute andfuneral
procession fortheyoung lifethathadended inhisarms.Hefeltan
anger toointense toidentify except asapressure within him: itwas
adesire tokill.
The desire wasnotdirected attheunknown thugwhohadsenta
bullet through theboy’s body, oratthelooting bureaucrats whohad
hired thethug todo it,but attheboy's teachers whohaddelivered
him,disarmed, tothethug’s gun—atthesoft, safeassassins ofcollege
classrooms who, incompetent toanswer thequeries ofaquest for
reason, took pleasure incrippling theyoung minds entrusted to
their care.
Somewhere, hethought, there was thisboy’s mother, whobad
trembled with protective concern over hisgroping steps, while teach-
inghimtowalk,whohadmeasured hisbaby foimulas with ajewel-
er'scaution, whohadobeyed with azealot’s fervor thelatest words
ofscience onhisdietandhygiene, protecting hisunhardened body

bythemenwho taught him thathehadnomind andmust never
attempt tothink.Hadshefedhimtainted refuse, hethought, had
shemixed poison into hisfood, itwould havebeenmore kindand
less fatal.
Hethought ofalltheliving species that train theiryoung inthe
artofsurvival, thecatswho teach their kittens tohunt, thebirds
whospend such strident effort onteaching their fledglings tofly—
yetman,whose toolofsurvival isthemind, does notmerely failto
teach achild tothink, butdevotes thechild's education tothepur-
pose ofdestroying hisbrain, ofconvincing himthatthought isfutile

From the firstcatch-phrases flung a*achild tothe last, itislike
aseries ofshocks tofreeze hismotor, toundercut thepower ofhis
consciousness. “Don't asKsomany questions, children should be

Menwould shudder, hethought, iftheysawamother birdpluck-
ingthefeathers from thewings ofheryoung, thenpushing himout
ofthenest tostruggle forsurvival— yetthatwaswhat they didto
their children.
Armed with nothing butmeaningless phrases, thisboyhadbeen
thrown tofight forexistence, hehadhobbled andgroped through a
brief,doomed effort, hehadscreamed hisindignant, bewildered pro-
test—andhadperished inhts firstattempt tosoaronhismangled

Butadifferent breed ofteachers hadonce existed, hethought,
andhadreared themenwho created thiscountry; hethought that

Hewent through thegateofthemills, barely noticing theguards
who lethimenter,who stared athisfaceand hisburden; hedidnot
pause tolisten totheir words, astheypointed tothefighting inthe

Hestepped into alighted room lullotmen.bloody bandages and

Hewalked mthedirection olthefront gate, toward theglare of
tireandthebursts ofguns.Hesaw,once inawhile, afewfigures
running through theciacks between structures ordarling behind
hlack corners, pursued bygroups ofguards andworkers: hewas
astonished tonotice that hisworkers were wellarmed. Theyseemed
tohavesubdued thehoodlums inside themills, andonly thesiege
atthefront gateremained tobebeaten. Hesawaloutscurrying
across apatch oflamplight, swinging alength ofpipe atawall of
glass panes, battering themdown withananimal relish, dancing like
agorilla tothesound ofcrashing glass, until three husky human
figures descended upon him. carrying himwrithing totheground.
Thesiege ofthegateappeared tobeebbing, asifthespine ofthe
mobhadbeen broken. Heheard thedistant sciceches oftlieircries—
buttheshots from theroadwere growing rarer, the firesettothe
gatekeeper’s office wasputout,there werearmed menontheledges
and atwindows, posted inwell-planned defense.
Ontheroofofastructure above thegate, hesaw. ashecame
closer, theslim silhouette ofamanwho held agun ineachhand
and,frombehind theprotection ofachimney, kept firing atintervals
down intothemob, firing swiftly and, itseemed, intwodirections
atonce, likeasentinel protecting theapproaches tothegate.The
confident skillofhismovements, hismanner offiring, withnotime
wasted totakeaim,butwith thekind ofcasual abruptness thatnever

Rearden watched himwith detached, impersonal pleasure, asifthe
battle ofthemillswere nothisanylonger, buthecould stillenjoy
thesight ofthecompetence andcertainty withwhichmen ofthat
distant agehadoncecombatted evil.
Thebeam ofaroving searchlight struck Rearden’s face,andwhen

Rearden hurried onthrough theshort stretch ofdarkness ahead—
butthen, from theside, from thecrack ofanalley, heheard a
drunken voice yell,“There he is!’"andwhirled toseetwobcety
figures advancing upon him.Hesaw aleering, mindless facewith a
mouth hung loose inajoyless chuckle, andaclub inarising fist—
heheard thesound ofrunning steps approaching from another direc-
tion,heattempted toturn hishead, then theclubcrashed down on
hisskull from behind—and inthemoment ofsplitting darkness,
when hewavered, refusing tobelieve it,then felthimself going down,
hefeltastrong, protective armseizing himandbreaking his fall,he
heard agunexploding aninchabove hiscar,thenanother explosion
from thesame gun inthesame second, but itseemed faintand
distant, asifhehad fallendown ashaft.
His firstawareness, when heopened hiseyes,wasasense ofpro*

and thatthetwomen standing beside himwere themills' doctor

Themeaning ofhisbandage andthemeaning ofhisoffice were

norhisbusiness.
“Ithink illbeallright, Doctor," hesaid, raising hishead.
“Yes, Mr.Rearden, fortunately.” Thedoctor waslooking athim
asifstillunable tobelieve that thishadhappened toHank Rearden
inside hisown mills; thedoctor’s voice wastense withangry loyalty
andindignation. “Nothing serious, justascalpwound andaslight
concussion. Butyoumust take iteasyandallow yourself torest.”
“Iwill,” saidRearden firmly.
“It’s altover,” saidthesuperintendent, waying atthemillsbeyond
thewindow, “We’ve gotthebastards beateti andontherun.You

“Oh yes! Inever thought I’dlivetoseethedaywhen—”
“Iknow.Goahead, takecare of it.Tilbeallright.”
“Yes, Mr.Rearden.”
“I'lltakecareoftheplace,” saidthesuperintendent, asthedoctor

hurried out.“Everything’s under control, Mr,Rearden. But itwas
thedirtiest—”
“Iknow,” saidRearden. “Who was itthatsavedmylife?Some-
body grabbed meas 1fell,and fired atthethugs.”
“Did he!Straight atIheir faces. Blew their heads off.Thatwas
thatnewfurnace foreman ofours.Been heretwomonths. Bestman
I’veever had.He’s theonewho gotwise towhat thegravy boys
were planning andwarned me, thisatternoon. Toldmetoarmour

thewhole battle, andstood onaroot, picking offthescum thatcame
looclose tothegate. Boy,what amarksman! Ishudder tothink
howmany ofour lives hesaved tonight. Those bastards were out
forblood, Mr.Rearden.”
“I’d like toseehim."
“He’s waiting somewhere outside. It’shewhobrought youhere,
andheasked permission tospeak toyou.when possible."
“Send him inThen goback outthere, lakecharge, finish thejob.”
“Isthere anything else Icandoforyou,Mr.Rearden?”
“No, nothing else.”
Helay still,alone inthesilence ofhisoffice. Heknew' that the
meaning othismills hadceased toexist, andthefullness ofthe
knowledge leftnoroom forthepain ofrcgreifing anillusion. Hehad
seen, inafinal image, thesoulandessence ofhisenemies: the
mindJeSvS faceofthethug with theclub. Itwasnottheface itself
thatmade himdraw back inhorror, buttheprofessors, thephiloso-
phers, themoralists, themystics whohadreleased that faceupon
theworld
He tellapeculiar cleanliness. Itwasmade ofpride andoflove
lorthisearth, thisearth which was his,nottheirs. Itwasthefeeling
which hadmoved himthrough his life,thefeeling which someamong
menknow intheir youth, then betray, butwhich hehadnever be-
trayed andhadcarried within him asabattered, attacked, unidenti-
fied,but living motor— thefeeling which hecouldnowexperience
initsfull,uncontested purity: thesense ofhisown superlative value
andthesuperlative value ofhis life. Itwasthe final certainty that
hislifewas his,tobelived withnobondage toevil,andthat that
bondage hadnever been necessary. Itwastheradiant serenity of
knowing thathew'as treeoffear, ofpain, ofguilt.
Ifit’strue,hethought, that there areavengers who areworking
forthedeliverance ofmen likeme, letthem seemenow, letthem
tellmetheir secret, letthem claim me, letthem—“Come in!”he
saidaloud, inanswer totheknock onhisdoor.
Thedooropened andhelay still.Themanstanding onthethresh-
old,withdisheveled hair, asoot-streaked faceandfurnace-smudgec
arms, dressed inscorched overalls andbloodstained shirt, standing
asifhewore acapewaving behind hint inthewind, wasFranciscc
d’Anconia.
913
Itseemed toRearden that hisconsciousness shotforward ahead
ofhisbody, itwas hisbody thatrefused tomove, stunned byshock,
while hismindwaslaughing, telling himthat thiswasthemost natu-
ral,themost-to-have-been -expected event intheworld.
Francisco smiled, asmile ofgreeting toachildhood friend ona
summer morning, asifnothing elsehadeverbeen possible between
them—andRearden found himself smiling inanswer, sonic part of
himfeeling anincredulous wonder, yetknowing that itwas irresist-
ibly right.
“You’ve been torturing yourself formonths,” saidFrancisco, ap-
proaching him,‘‘wondering whatwords you'd usetoaskmyforgive-
nessandwhether youhadtheright toask it,if,youeversawme
again— butnowyouseethat itisn't necessary, that there’s nothing
toaskortoforgive.”
“Yes,” saidRearden, theword coming asanastonished whisper,
butbythetime hefinished hissentence heknew that thiswasthe
greatest tribute hecould offer, “yes. Iknow it.”
Francisco satdown onthecouch beside him,andslowly moved
hishand over Rearden's forehead. Itwas likeahealing touch that
closed thepast.
“There’s onlyonething lwant totellyou,” saidRearden. “Iwant
youtohear itfrom me:youkeptyour oath, youweremyfriend."
“Iknew thatyouknew it.Youknew itfrom the first.Youknew
it,nomatter whatyouthought ofmyactions. Youslapped mebe
cause youcould notforce yourself todoubt it.”
“That ..whispered Rearden, staring athim, "thatwasthething

“Didn’t yousuppose I'dunderstand it?”
“1wanted tofindyou... Ihadnoright tolook foryou .. .And
allthat time, youwere—”fiepointed atFrancisco's clothes, then
hishanddropped helplessly andheclosed hiseyes.
“Iwasyour furnace foreman,” said Francisco, grinning. “1didn't
think you'd mind that.Youoffered methejobyourself.”
“You’ve been here, asmybodyguard, fortwomonths?”
“Yes.”
“You’ve been here, ever since- fiestopped.
“That’s right.Onthemorning ofthedaywhen youwere reading
myfarewell message over theroofs ofNew York, Jwasreporting
here formy first shift asyour furnace foreman.”
“Tell me,” saidRearden slowly, “that night atJames Taggart's
wedding, when yousaid thatyouwere aftery0ur greatest conquest ...
youmeant me,didn’t you?”
;
“Ofcourse.”v
Francisco drew himself upalittle, asiffofasolemn task, hisface
earnest, thesmile remaining only inhiseyfs,“1have agreat deal

Rearden smiled. “What word, FranciscoV?
Francisco inclined hishead inacceptance, andanswered, “Thank

Ihadcome tosay,butdidnot finish, thatnightwhen Icame here
forthe firsttime. 1think you’re ready tohear it.”
“Iam.”
The glare ofsteel being poured from afurnace shot tothesky
beyond thewindow. Aredglowwentsweeping slowly over thewalls
oftheoffice, over theempty desk, overRearden’s face, asifinsalute
andfarewell.
Chapter VII"THIS ISJOHN GALTSPEAKING"
Thedoorbell wasringing likeanalarm, inalong,demanding scream,
bioken bytheimpatient stabs ofsomeone's trantic finger.
leaping outo<bed,Dagny noticed thecold, pale sunlight oflate
morning andaclock onadistant spiremarking thehour often.She
hadworked attheoffice tilllouramandhad leftword nottoexpect
her tillnoon.
Thewhite faceungroomed bypanic, thatconfronted herwhen she
threw thedoor open, wasJames Taggart.
‘He’s gone!" hecried.
“Who’”
"Hank Rcarden! He’s gone. quit, vanished, disappeared!”
Shestood stillforamoment, holding thebellofthedressing gown
shehadbeen tying; then, asthe fullknowledge reached her.her
hands jerked thebelt light—as ilsnapping herbody intwo atthe
waistline -while sheburst outlaughing. Itwasasound oftriumph.
Hestared atherinbewilderment. “What’s thematter withyou?”
hegasped. “Haven't youunderstood?”
“Come in,Jim,” she said, turning contemptuously, walking into
theliving room.“Oh yes. I’veunderstood.”
“He's quit!Gone! Gone like alltheothers! Left hismills, his
bank accounts, hisproperty, everything! Justvanished! Took some
clothing andwhatever hehad inthesafe inhisapartment—they
lound asafe leftopen inhisl^edroom, open andempty— that's all!
Noword, nonote,noexplanation! They calledmefromWashington,

itwent through themills likeoneofthose furnace break-outs, the
word thathe’dgone, andthen . . .before anyone could stop it,a

lurgist, thechid engineer. Reardon's secretary, even thehospital
doctor! AndGodknows howmany others! Deserting, thebastards!
Deserting us.inspite ofallthepenalties we've setup!He's quitand
therestarcquitting andthose nulls arejust leftthere, standing still!
Doyouunderstand what thatmeans?”
“DoyouV' sheasked.
Hehadthrown hisstory ather,sentence bysentence, asiftrying
toknock thesmile offherface,anodd,unmoving smile ofbitterness
andtriumph: hehad failed, “it's anational catastrophe! What’s the
matter withyou? Don’t youseethat it’safatalblow? Itwillbreak
915
the lastofthecountry’s morale andeconomy! Wecan’t lethim
vanish! You’ve gottobring himback!”
Hersmile disappeared.
“You can!” hecried. “You’re theonlyonewho can!He'syour
lover, isn'the?...Oh,don’t look like that! it’snotime forsquea-
mishness! It'snotime foranything except thatwe’ve gottohave
him!Youmustknow where he is!Youcan findhim!Youmust
reach himandbring himback!”
Thewayshenowlooked athimwasworse than hersmile— she
looked asifshewere seeing himnaked andwould notendure the
sightmuch longer. “Ican't bring himback,” shesaid, notraising
hervoice.“And lwouldn’t, if Icould.Now getoutofhere.”
“But thenational catastrophe —”
“Get out.”
Shedidnotnotice hisexit.Shestood alone inthemiddle ofher
living room, herhead dropping, hershoulders sagging, while shewas
smiling, asmile ofpain, oftenderness, ofgreeting toHank Rearden.
Shewondered dimly whysheshould feelsoglad thathehadfound
liberation, socertain thathewas right, and yetrefuse herself the
same deliverance. Two sentences were beating inhermind; onewas
thetriumphant sweep of:He’s free, he’soutoftheir reach!—the
other was likeaprayer oidedication: There’s stillachance towin,
but letmebetheonly victim. . . .
Itwasstrange—shethought, inthedays thatfollowed, looking at
themenaround her—thatcatastrophe hadmade them aware of
Hank Rearden with anintensity that hisachievements had not
aroused, asitthepaths oftheir consciousness wereopen todisaster,
butnottovalue. Some spoke ofhim inshrill curses -others whis-
pered, with alook ofguiltand terror, asifanameless retribution
werenow todescend uponthem— some tried, with hysterical eva-
'siveness, toactasifnothing hadhappened.
Thenewspapers, likepuppets ontangled strings, were shouting
withthesame belligerence andonthesame dates: “It issocial trea-
sontoascribe toomuch importance toHank Reardon’s desertion
andtoundermine public morale bytheold-fashioned belief thatan
individual canbeofanysignificance tosociety.” “It issocial treason
tospread rumors about thedisappearance ofHank Rearden, Mi.
Rearden hasnotdisappeared, heisinhisoffice, running hismills,
asusual, andthere hasbeennotrouble atRearden Steel, except a
minor disturbance, aprivate scuffle among some workers.” “It is
social treason tocastanunpatriotic lightupon thetragic lossof
Hank Rearden, Mr.Rearden hasnotdeserted, hewas killed inan
automobile accident onhiswaytowork, andthisgricf-strickcn family
hasinsisted onaprivate funeral.”
j
Itwasstrange, shethought, toobtain ne^s bymeans ofnothing
butdenials, asifexistence hadceased, factshadvanished andonly
thefrantic negatives uttered byofficials andcolumnists gaveanyclue
tothereality theywere denying. “It isnottrue thattheMiller Steel
Foundry ofNew Jersey hasgone outofbusiness.” “It isnottrue
thattheJansen Motor Company ofMichigan hasclosed itsdoors.”
“It isavicious, anti-social liethatmanufacturers ofsteel products
916
arecollapsing under thethreat ofasteel shortage. There isnoreason
toexpect asteel shortage/’ “U isaslanderous, unfounded rumor
thataSteel Unification Planhadbeen inthemaking andthat ithad
been favored byMr.Orren Boyle. Mr.Boyle’s attorney hasissued
anemphatic denial andhasassured thepress thatMr.Boyle isnow
vehemently opposed toanysuch plan. Mr.Boyle, atthemoment, is
suffering from anervous breakdown.”
Butsome news could bewitnessed inthestreets ofNewYork, in
thecold,dank twilight ofautumn evenings: acrowd gathered infront
ofahardware store, where theowner hadthrown thedoors open,
inviting people tohelp themselves tothe lastofhismeager stock,
while helaughed inshrieking sobsandwentsmashing hisplate-glass
windows —acrowd gathered atthedoor ofarun-down apartment
house, where apolice ambulance stood waiting, while thebodies of
aman, hiswifeand their three children were being removed from
agas-filled room; themanhadbeen asmall manufacturer ofsteel
castings.
Ifthey seeHank Reardcn’s valuenow— shethought—why didn't
they see itsooner? Why hadn't they averted theirowndoom and
spared him hisyears ofthankless torture? Shefound noanswer.
Inthesilence ofsleepless nights, shethought thatHank Rearden
andshehadnowchanged places, hewas inAtlantis andshewas
locked outbyascreen otlight—hewas,perhaps, calling toheras
shehadcalled tohisstruggling airplane, butnosignal could reach
herthrough thatscreen.
Yetthescreen splitopen torone briefbreak—forthelength ofa
letter shereceived aweek after hevanished. Theenvelope boreno
return address, only thepostmark ofsome hamlet inColorado. The
letter contained twosentences:
Ihavemethim. Idon’t blame you.
H.R.
She sat stillforalong time, looking atthe letter, asifunable to
move ortofeel.She feltnothing, shethought, then noticed thather
shoulders were trembling inafaint, continuous shudder, then
grasped thatthetearing violence within herwasmade ofanexultant
tribute, ofgratitude andofdespair—hertribute tothevictory that
themeeting titthesetwomen implied, thefinal victory ofboth—her
gratitude thaithose inAtlantis stillregarded herasoneofthemand
hadgranted hertheexception ofreceiving amessage—thedespair
oftheknowledge thatherblankness was astruggle nottohear the
questions shewasnow hearing. HadGaltabandoned her?Hadhe
gone tothevalley tomeet hisgreatest conquest? Would hecome
back?Hadhegiven herup?Theunendurable wasnotthat these
questions hadnoanswer, butthattheanswer wassosimply, soeasily
within herreach andthatshehadnoright totake asteptoreach it.
Shehadmade noattempt toseehim.Every morning, foramonth*
onentering her office, shehadbeen conscious, notoftheroom
around her,butofthetunnels below, under thefloors ofthebuild-
ing—andshehadworked, feeling asifsome marginal partofher
brainwascomputing figures, reading reports, making decisions ina
rushoflifeless activity, while herliving mindwasinactive and still,
917
frozen incontemplation, forbidden tomove beyond thesentence:
He'sdown there. Theonly inquiry shehadpermitted herself had
been aglance atthepayroll listoftheTerminal workers. Shehad
seen thename: Galt, John,The listhadcarried it,openly, forover
twelve years. Shehadseenanaddress next tothename—and, fora
month, hadstruggled toforget it.
Ithadseemed hard tolivethrough thatmonth—yetnow, asshe
looked attheletter, thethought thatGalthadgonewas stillharder
tobear.Even thestruggle ofresisting hisproximity hadbeen alink
tohim, aprice topay,avictory achieved inhisname.Now there
wasnothing, except aquestion thatwasnottobeasked. Hispresence
inthetunnels hadbeen hermotor through thosedays— justashis
presence inthecityhadbeen hermotor through themonths ofthat
summer—justashispresence somewhere intheworld hadbeen her
motor through theyears before sheeverheard hisname.Now she
feltasifhermotor, too,hadstopped.
Shewent on,with thebright, puie glitter otafivedollar gold
piece, which shekept inherpocket, asher lastdrop ofluel.She
went on,protected from theworld around herbyalastarmor:
indifference.
Thenewspapers didnotmention theoutbreaks ofviolence that
hadbegun toburst across thecountry—butshewatched them
through thereports oftrain conductors about bullet-riddled cars,
dismantled tracks, attacked trains, besieged stations, inNebraska, in
Oregon, mTexas, inMontana—the futile, doomed outbreaks,
prompted bynothing butdespair, ending innothing butdestruction.
Some were theexplosions oflocal gangs; some spread wider, '('here
were districts thatrose inblind rebellion, arrested thelocal officials,
expelled theagents ofWashington, killed thetaxcollectors— then,
announcing their secession from thecountry, wentontothe final
extreme ofthevery evilthathaddestroyed them, asiflighting mur-
derwith suicide: wentontpseize allproperty within their reach, to
declare community bondage ofalltoall,andtoperish within aweek,
theirmeager lootconsumed, inthebloody hatred ofalltor all,in
thechaos ofnorules save thatofthegun, toperish under thelethar-
gicthrust ofafewworn soldiers sentoutfromWashington tobring
order totheruins.
Thenewspapers didnotmention tt.The editorials wentonspeak-
ingofself-denial astheroad tofuture progress, ofself-sacrifice as
themoral imperative, ofgreed astheenemy, oflove asthesolu-
tion—their threadbare phrases assickcningly sweet astheodor of

Rumors went spreading through thecour^try inwhispers ofcynical
terror—yetpeople read thenewspapers ant|acted asiftheybelieved

“Listen toMr.Thompson’s report ontheworld crisis,November
22!”
itwasthe firstacknowledgment oftheunacknowledged. Thean*
nouncemcnts began toappear aweek inadvance andwent ringing
across thecountry. “Mr.Thompson willgive thepeople areport on
theworld crisis! Listen toMr.Thompson onevery radio station and
television channel at8pm ,onNovember 22!“
First, thefront pages ofthenewspapers andtheshouts ofthe
radio voices hadexplained it:"Tocounteract thefearsandrumors
spread bytheenemies ofthepeople, Mr.Thompson willaddress the

Then thechorus broke loose andwentgrowing daybyday.“Listen
toMr.Thompson onNovember 22’“ said daily headlines. “Don't
torget Mr.Thompson onNovember 22!“ cried radio stations atthe
endofevery program. "Mr. Thompson will tellyouthetruth!" said
placards insubways andbuses—then posters onthewalls ofbuild-

“Don't despair1Listen toMrThompson!” Saidpennants ongov-
ernment cars.“Don’t giveup!Listen toMr.Thompson*” saidban-

saidvoices inchurches. “Mr.Thompson willgiveyoutheanswer!”
wrote army airplanes across thesky.theletters dissolving inspace,
andonly the lasttwowords remaining bythetime thesentence
wascompleted.
Public loud-speakers were built inthesquares otNewYork for
thedayofthespeech, andcame torasping lifeonce anhour, in
timewith theringing otdistant clocks, tosend over theworn rattle
ofthe traffic, over theheads ottheshabby crowd, thesonorous,
mechanical cryofanalarm-toned voice* “Listen toMr.Thompson's
report ontheworld crisis,November22’“—acryrolling through the
frosted airandvanishing among thefoggy roof tops,under theblank
page ofacalendar thatborenodate.
Ontheafternoon ofNovember 22,James Taggart toldDagny that
Mr.Thompson wished tomeet herforaconference before the
broadcast.
“InWashington?” sheasked incredulously, glancing atherwatch.
“Well. Imust saythatyouhaven’t been reading thenewspapers
orkeeping track ofimportant events. Don’t youknow thatMr,
Thompson istobroadcast fromNewYork?Hehascome here to
confer with theleaders ofindustry, aswell asoflabor, science, the
professions, andthebestofthecountry’s leadership ingeneral. He
hasrequested that 1bring youtotheconference.”
“Where isittobeheld?”
91<)
“Atthebroadcasting studio.”
“They don’t expect metospeak ontheairinsupport oftheir

“Don’t worry, theywouldn't letvownear amicrophone! They just
want tohearyour opinion, andyoucan’t refuse, notmanational
emergency, notwhen it'saninvitation from Mr,Thompson inper-
son!'’Hespoke impatiently, avoiding hereyes.
“When isthatconference tobeheld?”
“Atseven-thirty.”
“Notmuch time togiveaconference about anational emergency,
isit?”
“Mr.Thompson isaverybusyman.Now please don’t argue, don’t
start being difficult, Idon’t seewhat you’re—”
“All right,” she said indifferently, ‘Tilcome,” andadded,
prompted bythekind atfeeling thatwould havemade herreluctant
toventure without awitness into aconference otgangsters, “but I’ll
bring Eddie Willers along withme.”
Hefrowned, considering itforamoment, withalook otannoyance
more than anxiety. “Oh. allright, ifyouwish,” hesnapped, shrug-
g*ng-
Shecame tothebroadcasting studio withJames Taggart asapo-
liceman atonesideofherandEddie Willers asabodyguard atthe
other. Taggart’s facewasresentful andtense, Eddie’s—resigned, yet
wondering andcurious. Astage setofpasteboard walls hadbeen
erected inacorner ofthevast,dimspace, representing astiffly tradi-
tional suggestion ofacross between astately drawing room anda
modest study.Asemicircle ofempty armchairs filled the set,sug-
gesting agrouping from afamily album, withmicrophones dangling
like bait attheendoflong poles extended forfishing among the
chairs.
The best leadership ofthecountry, thatstood about innervous
clusters, hadthelook ofaremnant sale inabankrupt store: shesaw
Wesley Mouch. Eugene Lawson, Chick Morrison, Tinky Holloway,
Dr.Floyd Ferris, Dr.Simon Pritchett. Ma Chalmers, Fred Kinnan.
andaseedy handful ofbusinessmen among whom thehalf-scared,
half-flattered figure ofMr.Mowen oftheAmalgamated Switch and
Signal Company was, incredibly, intended torepresent anindus-
trialtycoon.
Butthefigure thatgave heraninstant’s shock wasDrRobert
Stadler, Shehadnotknown that afacecould agesogreatly within
thebrief space ofone year: thelook oftimeless energy, ofboyish
eagerness, wasgone, andnothing remained ofthefaceexcept the
lines ofcontemptuous bitterness. Hestood alone, apart from the
others, andshesawthemoment when hiseyesisaw herenter; helooked
likeaman inawhorehouse whohadaccepted thenature ofhis
surroundings untilsuddenly caught thereb^hiswife: itwasalook
ofguilt intheprocess ofbecoming hatred! Then shesawRobert
Stadler, thescientist, turnaway asifhehadnotseenher—asifhis
refusal toseecould wipe afactoutofexistence.
Mr.Thompson waspacing among thegroups, snapping atrandom
bystanders intherestless manner ofamanofaction who feelscon-
920
tempt fortheduly ofmaking speeches. Hewasclutching asheaf of
typewritten pages, asifitwere abundle ofoldclothing about to
bediscarded.
James Taggart caught him inmid-step, tosayuncertainly and
loudly, “Mr. Thompson, may1present my sister. MissDagny
Taggart?"
“Soniceofyoutocome. MissTaggart." saidMr.Thompson, shak-
ingherhand asifshewere another voter from backhome whose
name hehadnever heard before; thenhemarched briskly off.
“Where's theconference, Jim?’' sheasked, andglanced atthe
clock: itwasahuge white dialwith ablack hand slicing theminutes,
likeaknifemoving toward thehour oleight.
"Ican't help it! Idon't run thisshow!” hesnapped.
Eddie Willers glanced atherwith alook ofbitterly patient as-
tonishment, andstepped closer toherside.
Aradio receiver wasplaying aprogram ofmilitary marches broad-
castfrom another studio, baif-drowning thefragments ofnervous
voices, ofhastily aimless steps, ofscreeching machinery being pulled
tofocusupon thedrawing-room set.
“Stay tuned tohearMr.Thompson's report ontheworld crisis at
eightpm!”cried themartial voice ofanannounce!, from theradio-
receiver -when thehandonthedialreached thehour ol7:45.
“Step on it,boys, steponit!”snapped Mr.Thompson, while the
radio burst intoanother march.
Itwas7:50whenChickMorrison, theMorale Conditioner, who
seemed tobeincharge, cried. “All right, boysand girls, allright,
let'stakeourplaces!” waving abunch ofnotepaper, likeabaton,
toward thelight-flooded circle ofatmehairs,
Mr.Thompson thudded down upon thecentral chair,mtheman-
nerofgrabbing avacant seat inasubway.
Chick Morrison's assistants were herding thecrowd toward the
circle oflight
“Ahappy family,” (hickMorrison explained, “the count! ymust
seeusasabig,united, happy—What's thematter with that thing?*'
Theradio music hadgone offabruptly, choking onanodd littlegasp
olstatic, cut inthemiddle ofaringing phrase. Itwas 7:51.He
shiugged andwent on:“—happy family. Hurry up.boys.Take close-
upsofMrThompson, first.”
Thehand ofthedock went slicing offtheminutes, while press
photographers clicked theircameras atMr.Thompson’s sourly impa-
tient face.
“Mr. Thompson will sitbetween science and industry!” Chick
Morrison announced. "Dr. Stadler, please—thechaironMr.Thomp-
son's left. Miss Taggart—thisway, please—onMr.Thompson's
right.”
Dr.Stadler obeyed. Shedidnotmove.
“It'snotjustforthepress, it’sforthetelevision audiences,” Chick
Morrison explained toher, inthetone ofaninducement.
Shemade astep forward. “Iwillnottake part inthisprogram,”
shesaidevenly, addressing Mr.Thompson.
“You won't?” heasked blankly, with thekind oflookhewould
921
haveworn ifoneoftheflower vaseshadsuddenly refused! toperform

Themodern mystics ofmuscle who offeryouthefraudulent alterna-

doctrine ofsoulversus body. Only aghost canexist without material
property; only aslave canwork withnoright totheproduct ofhis

rights’ simply means thatsomehuman beings have theright tomake
property outofothers; since thecompetent have nothing togain
from theincompetent, itmeans theright oftheincompetent toown
their betters andtousethem asproductive cattle Whoever regards

“Itwasn't real,wasit?”saidMr.Thompson.
Theystood infront oftheradio, asthelastsound otGalt svoice
had leftthem.Noonehadmoved through thespan ofsilence; they
hadstood, looking attheradio, asifwaiting. ButtheradiowasnowW
only awooden boxwithsome knobs andacircle ofcloth stretched
overanempty loud-speaker.
“Weseem tohave heard it,”saidTinky Holloway.
“We couldn’t help it,”saidChick Morrison.
Mr.Thompson was sitting onacrate. The pale, oblong smear at
thelevel ofhiselbow wasthefaceofWesley Mouch, whowasseated
onthefloor. Farbehind them, likeanisland inthevastsemidarknoss
ofthestudio space, thedrawing room prepared fortheir broadcast
stood deserted and fully lighted, asemicircle ofempty armchairs
under acobweb ofdead microphones intheglare ofthefloodlights
which noonehadtaken theinitiative toturn off.
Mr.Thompson’s eyeswere darting over thefacesaround him, as
ifinsearch ofsome special vibrations known only tohim.The rest
ofthemwere trying todo itsurreptitiously, eachattempting tocatch
aglimpse oftheothers without letting them catch hisown glance.
“Letmeoutofhere!” screamed ayoung third-rate assistant, sud-
denly andtonoone inparticular.
“Stay put!” snapped Mr.Thompson.
Thesound ofhisownorder andthehiccough-moan ofthefigure
immobilized somewhere inthedarkness, seemed tohelphimrecap-
tureafamiliar version ofreality. Hisheademerged aninchhigher
from hisshoulders.
“Who permitted ittohap—”hebegan inarising voice, but
stopped; thevibrations hecaught were thedangerous panic ofthe
cornered. “What doyoumake oiit?”heasked, instead. There was
noanswer. “Well?” Hewaited. “Well, saysomething, somebody!”
“We don’t have tobelieve it,dowe?” criedJames Taggart, thrust-
inghisfacetoward Mr.Thompson, inamanner thatwasalmost a
threat. “Dowe?” Taggart’s facewasdistorted; htsfeatures seemed
shapeless; amustache ofsmall beads sparkled between hisnose
andmouth.
“Pipe down,” saidMr.Thompson uncertainly, drawing alittle
away from him.
“Wc don’t have tobelieve it!”Taggart's voice hadthe flat, insis-
tentsound ofaneffort tomaintain atrance. “Nobody's ever said it
before! It’sjustoneman!Wedon’t have tobelieve it!”
“Take iteasy,” saidMr.Thompson.
“Why ishesosure he'sright?Who ishetogoagainst thewhole
world, against everything ever said forcenturies andcenturies? Who
ishetoknow? Nobody canbesure!Nobody canknow what’s right!
There isn’tanyright’”
“Shut up!” yelled Mr.Thompson. “What areyoutrying to—”
The blast thatstopped himwasamilitary march leaping suddenly
forthfrom theradio receiver—themilitary march interrupted three
hours ago,played bythefamiliar screeches ofastudio record. It
tookthem afewstunned seconds tograip it,while thecheerful,
thumping chords went goose-stepping through thesilence, sounding
grotesquely irrelevant, likethemirth ofahalf-wit. The station’s pro-
gram director wasblindly obeying theabsolute thatnoradio time
wasever tobeleftblank.

“Tellthem tocut itoft!”screamed Wesley Mouch, leaping tohis
feet. “Itwillmake thepublic think thatweauthorized thatspeech!”
“Youdamn fooP” cried Mr.Thompson. “Would yourather have
thepublic think thatwedidn’t?”
Mouch stopped short andhiseyes shot toMr.Thompson withthe
appreciative glance ofanamateur atamaster.
“Broadcasts asusual!” ordered Mr.Thompson. “Tellthem togo
onwithwhatever programs they'd scheduled forthishour!Nospe-
cialannouncements, noexplanations’ Tellthem togoonasifnoth-
inghadhappened!”
Halfadozen ofChick Morrison’s morale conditioners went scurry-
ingofftoward telephones.
“Muzzle thecommentators! Don’t allow them tocomment! Send
word toevery station inthecountry! Letthepublic wonder! Don’t
letthem think thatwe’re worried! Don’t letthem think that it’s
important!”
“No!” screamed Eugene Lawson, “No, no.no’Wecan’t givepeo-
pletheimpression thatwe’ie endorsing thatspeech! It'shorrible,
horrible, horrible!’’ Lawson wasnotintears, buthisvoice hadthe
undignified sound ofanadult sobbing with helpless rage.
“Who’s saidanything about endorsing it?"snapped Mr.Thompson.
“It’s horrible! It’simmoral! It’sselfish, heartless, ruthless! It'sthe
most vicious speech evermade’ It .itwillmake people demand
tobehappy!”
“It'sonly aspeech,” saidMrThompson, nottoofirmly.
“Itseems tome,” saidChick Morrison, hisvoice tentatively help-
ful.“that people ofnobler spiritual nature, youknow what Imean,
people of . .of . . .well, ofmystical insight"—hepaused, asif
waiting tobeslapped, butnoonemoved, soherepeated firmly—
“yes, ofmystical insight, won’t goforthatspeech Logic isn’tevery-
thing, after all.”
“The workingmen won’t gofor it,”saidTinkv Holloway, abit
more helpfully. “He didn’t sound likeafriend otlabor,”
“Thewomen ofthecountry won’t gofor it.”declared MaChal-
mers. “It is,1believe, anestablished factthatwomen don’t gofor
that stuffabout themind.Women have finer feelings. Youcancount
onthewomen.”
“You cancount onthescientists,” saidDr.Simon Pritchett. They
were allpressing forward, suddenly eager tospeak, asiftheyhad
found asubject theycould handle with assurance. “Scientists know
better than tobelieve inreason. He'snofriend ofthescientists.”
”He\ nofriend ofanybody," saidWesley Mouch, recapturing a
shade ofconfidence atthesudden realization, “except maybe of
bigbusiness,”
“No!” cried Mr.Mowen interror. ”No! Don't accuse us!Don’t
say it! Iwon't haveyousayit!”
“What?”
“That ...that .,.thatanybody isafriend ofbusiness!”
“Don’t let’smake afussabout thatspeech.” saidDr.Floyd Ferris,
981
“Itwastoointellectual. Much toointellectual forthecommon man.
Itwillhavenoeffect. People aretoodumb tounderstand it.”
“Yeah,” saidMouch hopefully, “that’s so."
“Inthe first place,” saidDr. Ferris, encouraged, “people can’t
think. Inthesecond place, they don't want to.”
“Inthethird place,” saidFredKinnan, “they don't want tostarve.
Andwhatdoyoupropose todoabout that?”
Itwasasifhehadpronounced thequestion which allolthepre-
ceding utterances hadbeen intended tostave off.Nooneanswered
him,butheads drew faintly deeper intoshoulders, andfigures drew
faintly closer tooneanother, likeasmall cluster under theweight
ofthestudio's empty space. Themilitary march boomed through the
silence with theinflexible gaiety ofagrinning skull.
“Turn itoff!” yelled Mr.Thompson, waving attheradio “1urn
thatdamn thing off!” ,
Someone obeyed him.Butthesudden silence wasworse.
“Well?" saidMr.Thompson atlast, raising hiseyes reluctantly to
FredKinnan “What doyouthinkweought todo9”
“Who. me?” chuckled Kinnan “Idon't run thisshow.”
Mr.Thompson slammed his fistdown onhisknee, “Say some-
thing--” heordered, butseeing Kinnan turnaway, added, “some-
body!” There werenovolunteers. “What arewetodo9"heyelled,
knowing that themanwhoanswered would, thereafter, betheman

“Ican!"
Itwrasawoman’s voice, but ithadthequality ofthevoice the\

tostepforward from thedarkness beyond thegroup. Asshestepped
forward, herfacefrightened them- because itwasdevoid oftear.
“Ican," shesaid, addressing Mr.Thompson “You’re togive up."
“Give up?” herepeated blankly.
“You’re through. Don't youseethatyou’re through? What else
doyouneed, afterwhat you’ve heard9Give upandgetoutofthe

“Don’t listen toher!” hecried, hiseyesavoiding hers, while hers
paused onhim forabrief, level glance thatbegan asashock of
astonishment andended asanobituary. “It’syour lifeorhis!”
“Keep quiet, Professor,” saidMr.Thompson, brushing himoff
with thejerk ofonehand. Mr.Thompson’s eyes were watching
Dagny, asifsome thought were struggling totakeshape inside his
skull.
“Youknow thetruth, allofyou,” shesaid,“and sodo I,andso

‘But it’streason!” cried Eugene 1awson. “She’s talking pure
treason!”
“Now, now,” saidMr.Thompson. “You don’t have togoto
extremes”
“Huh?” asked Tinky Holloway
“But . . .butsurely it'soutrageous?” asked Chick Morrison.
“You’re notagreeing with her.areyou0”asked Wesley Mouch.
“Who’s saidanything about agreeing?” saidMr.Thompson, his
tone surprisingly placid. “Don’t bepremature. Just don’t yoube
prematuie, anyofyou.There's noharm inlistening toanyargument,
isthere?”
“That kind ofargument0”asked Wesley Mouch. hisfinger stab-
bingagain andagain inDagny's direction.
“Any kind,” said Mr.Thompson placidly. “We mustn't be
intolerant,”
‘But it’streason, ruin, disloyalty, selfishness and big-business
propaganda!”
“Oh, Idon’t know,” saidMr.Thompson. “We've gottokeep an
openmind. We've gottogiveconsideration toevery one’s viewpoint.
Shemight havesomething there.Heknows what todoWe’ve got
tobeflexible.”
“Doyoumean thatyou're willing toquit?” gasped Mouch.
“Now don'tjump toconclusions,” snapped Mr.Thompson angrily.
“Ifthere's onething 1can't stand, it’speople whojump toconclu-
sions.And another thing isivory-tower intellectuals who stick to
some pettheory andhaven’t anysense ofpiactical reality. Atalime
hke this,we’ve gottobeflexible above all.”
Hesawalook ofbewilderment onallthefacesaround him,on
Dagny’s andontheothers, though notforthesame reasons. He
smiled, rose tohisfeetandturned toDagny.
“Thank you. Miss Taggart,” hesaid.“Thank you forspeaking

andspeak tomewith fullfrankness. We’re notyour enemies. Miss
Taggart. Don’t payanyattention totheboys—they’re upset, but

izethat, don’t you?”
‘Tve saideverything 1had tosay,” sheanswered, turning away
from him, withnoclue tothemeaning ofhiswords andnostrength
toattempt tofind it.
Sheturned toEddie Willers, whohadwatched themenaround
them with alook ofsogreat anindignation thatheseemed para-
lyzed—asifhisbrain were crying, “It’s evil!” andcould notmove
toanyfurther thought. Shejerked herhead, indicating thedoor; he
followed herobediently.
Dr.Robert Stadler waited until thedoor hadclosed after them,
then whirled onMr.Thompson. “You bloody fool!Doyouknow
what you’re playing with? Don’t youunderstand that it’s lifeor
death? That it’syouorhim?”
The thintremor thatranalong Mr.Thompson's lipswasasmile
ofcontempt. “It's afunny way foraprofessor tobehave. 1didn’t
think professors everwent topieces.”
“Don’t youunderstand? Don't youseethat it’soneortheother?”
‘‘And what isitthatyouwantmetodo?”
•“You must killhim.”
ItwasthefactthatDr.Stadler hadnotcried it.buthadsaid itin
aflat,cold, suddenly and fullyconscious voice, thatbrought achill
moment ofsilence asthewhole room’s answer.
“You must findhim,” said Dr.Stadler, hisvoice cracking and
rising oncemore.“You must leave nostone unturned tillyou find
himanddestroy him! Ifhelives, he lldestroy allofus! Ifhelives,
wecan’t!”
“Howam Itofindhim?” asked Mr.Thompson, speaking slowly
and carefully.
“I... Ican tellyou. 1cangiveyoualead.Watch thatTaggart

youtohim,sooner orlater.”
“How doyouknow that?”
‘isn’t itobvious? Isn't itsheer chance thatshehasn’t deserted

“Yeah,” saidMr.Thompson thoughtfully, ^‘yeah, that’s true.”He
jerked hisheadupwith asmile ofsatLsfactiob. “The professor’s gbt

hisfingers atMouch. “Have hertailed day4nd night. We've gotto

“Yes, sir,” saidMouch blankly.
984
‘‘Andwhen youfindhim/’ Dr.Stadler asked tensely, “you’ll kill
him?”
“Kill him,youdamn fool?Weneedhim!” cried Mr.Thompson.
Mouch waited, butnooneventured thequestion thatwasonev-
eryone’s mind, sohemade theeffort toutter stiffly, “1don’t under-
stand you,Mr.Thompson.”
“Oh,youtheoretical intellectuals!” saidMr.Thompson with exas-
peration. “What areyou allgaping at? It’ssimple. Whoever he is,
he’s aman ofaction. Besides, he’s gotapressure group: he’s cor-
nered allthemen ofbrains. Heknows what todo.We’ll findhim

“Sure. Oh, we’ll have tocompromise, we'llhave tomake afew

“But hisideas?”
“Mr.Thompson,” saidMouch, choking. “I . ..I’mafraid he's a

“There’s nosuch thing,” saidMr.Thompson.

Acoldwind rattled thebroken signs over thewindows otaban-
doned shops,mthestreet outside theradio station. The cityseemed
abnormally quiet. The distant rumble olthe traffic sounded lower
than usual andmade thewind sound louder. Empty sidewalks
stretched otfintothedarkness: afewlone figures stood inwhispering
clusters under therare lights.
Eddie Willcrs didnotspeak until theyweremany blocks away
from thestation. Hestopped abruptly, when theyreached adeserted
square where thepublic loud-speakers, which noonehadthought
ofturning off,werenowbroadcasting adomestic comedy—theshrill
voices ofahusband andwife quarreling over Junior’s dates—toan
empty stretch ofpavement enclosed byunlighted house fronts. Be-
yond thesquare, afewdots oflight, scattered vertically above the
twenty-fifth-floor limit ofthe city,suggested adistant, rising form,
which wastheTaggart Building.
Eddie stopped andpointed atthebuilding, hisfinger shaking.
“Dagny!” hecried, thenlowered hisvoice involuntarily. “Dagny,”
hewhispered. “Iknow him.He...heworks there . ..there ...”
Hekept pointing atthebuilding withincredulous helplessness. “He
works forTaggart Transcontinental ...”
“Iknow,” sheanswered; hervoice wasalifeless monotone.
“As atrack laborer ...asthelowest oftrack laborers ..
“Iknow.”
“I’ve talked tohim . .I'vebeen talking tohimforyears ...in
theTerminal cafeteria . . .Heused toaskquestions ... allsorts of
questions about therailroad, and I—God, Dagny! was Iprotecting
therailroad orwas Ihelping todestroy it?”
“Both. Neither. Itdoesn’t matter now.”
985
“Icould have staked my lifethatheloved therailroad!”
“Hedoes.”
“But hedestroyed it.”
“Yes.”
Shetightened, thecollar ofhercoatandwalked on,against agust
ofwind.
“Iused totalktohim,” hesaid, after awhile. “His face ..
Dagny, itdidn’t look likeanyoftheothers, it... itshowed thathe
understood somuch. ... Iwasglad,whenever 1sawhim there, in
thecafeteria ... Ijusttalked ... Idon’t think lknew thathewas

“Did heeveraskyouwhat Ilook like,when I’masleep?”
“Yes ...Yes,hedid... Idfound youonce, asleep intheoffice,
andwhen Imentioned it,he—”Heslopped, asasudden connection
crashed intoplace inhismind.
Sheturned tohim, intherayofastreet lamp, raising andholding
herface inlulllight forasilent, deliberate moment, as ifinanswer
andconfirmation ofhisthought.
Heclosed hiseyes“OhGod, Dagny!” hewhispered.
They walked oninsilence.
“He’s gonebynow, isn’the?”heasked. “From theTaggart Termi-
nal, Imean.”
“Eddie,” shesaid,hervoice suddenly grim, “ifyouvalue his life,
don’t ever askthatquestion. Youdon’t wantthem tolindhim,do
you? Don’t givethem anyleads. Don't everbreathe aword toany-
oneabout having known him.Don't trytofindoutwhether he’s still
working intheTerminal.”
“You don’tmean that he’s stillthere?”
“Idon't know, iknow only thathemight be.”
"Now?"
“Yes.”
“Still?”
“Yes. Keep quiet about it,ityoudon't want todestroy him.”
“Ithink he'sgoneHewon’t beback. Ihaven’t seenhimsince . .
since ...”
“Since when?” sheasked sharply.
“TheendofMay.Thenightwhen you leftforUtah, remember?”
Hepaused, asthememory ofthat night’s encounter andthe full
understanding ofitsmeaning struck himtogether. Hesaidwith ef-
fort, “1sawhimthat night. Notsince . . .I’vewaited torhim, inthe
cafeteria ...Henever came back.”
“Idon’t think he’ll letyouseehimno^, he'llkeep outofyoui
way.Butdon’t look forhim.Don’t inquir^.”
“It’s funny. Idon’t evenknow what nan|e heused. ItwasJohnny
something or—”
“ItwasJohn Galt,” she said, with affaint, mirthless chuckle.
“Don’t look attheTerminal payroll. Thejhame isstillthere.”
“Just likethat? Allthese years?”
“For twelve years. Just likethat.”
“And it’s stilltherenow?”
986
“Yes.”
After amoment, hesaid, “Itproves nothing, Iknow. Theperson-
neloffice hasn’t taken asingle name offthepayroll listsince Direc-
tive10-289. Ifaman quits, they give hisname andjobtoastarving
friend oftheirown, rather than report ittotheUnification Board.”
“Don’t question thepersonnel office oranyone. Don’t callatten-
tiontohisname. Ifyouor Imake anyinquiries about him,somebody
might begin towonder. Don't look forhim.Don’t make anymove
inhisdirection. And ifyouever catch sight ofhimbychance, act
asifyoudidn’t know him.’’
Henodded. After awhile, hesaid, hisvoice tense andlow, “1
wouldn’t turnhimover tothem, noteven tosave therailroad.”
“Eddie—”
“Yes?”
“Ifyouever catch sight ofhim, tellme.”
Henodded.
Two blocks later, heasked quietly. “You’re going toquit,oneof
these days, andvanish, aren’t you?”
“Why doyousaythat?” Itwasalmost acry.
“Aren’t you?”
Shedidnotanswer atonce,when shedid.thesound ofdespair
waspresent inhervoice only intheform ottootight amonotone:
“Eddie, ifIquit,whatwould happen totheTaggart trains?”
“There would benoTaggart trains within aw'eek. Maybe less.”
“There willbenolooters' government within tendays.Thenmen
likeCuffy Meigs willdevour the lastofour tailsandengines. Should

let itgo—Taggart Transcontinental. Eddie- goturever, when one

1canstand them alittle longer. Just alittle longer. I'mnothelping

“What aretheygoing todo?”
“Idon't know. What cantheydo?They ’tofinished.”
“1suppose so.”
“Didn’t youseethem? They're miseiable. panic-stricken rats,run-
ning fortheir lives.”
“Does itmean anything tothem?”
“What?”
“'Their lives,”
“They’re stillstruggling, aren’t they? Butthey're through andthey
know it.”
“Have theyever acted onwhat theyknow?”
“They’ll have to.They’ll give up. Itwon’t belong.And we’ll be
here tosavewhatever’s left.”
“Mr.Thompson wishes ittobeknown,” said official broadcasts
onthemorning ofNovember 23,“that there isnocause foralarm.
Heurges thepublic nottodraw anyhasty conclusions. Wemust

“They’re silent,” wrote Chick Morrison, asasummary ofitscon
tent, across thereport fromoneofthefield agents hehadsentout
onamission entitled Public Pulse Taking. “They’re silent,” hewrote
across thenext report, then across another andanother. “Silence,”
hewrote, with afrown ofuneasiness, summing uphisreport toMr.
Thompson. “People seem tobesilent.”
Theflames thatwentuptotheskyofawinter nightanddevoured

Onthemorning ofNovember 29.theworkers ofashoe factory
inMassachusetts were astonished, onentering their workshop, to
findthat theforeman was late.Buttheywent totheir usual posts
andwentonwith their habitual routine, pulling levers, pressing but-
tons, feeding leather intoautomatic cutters, piling boxes onamoving

front offices oftheplant were empty.
“Yougoddamn cannibals!” screamed awoman inthemidst ofa

theaudience showed nosignofastonishntent, asifshewere scream-

Chick Morrison attempted awhistle-stop tour tobuttress thecoun-
try’smorale byspeeches onself-sacrifice forthegeneral welfare. He
wasstoned atthe firstofhisstops andhadtoreturn toWashington.
Nobody hadever granted them the titleof“the better men” or,
granting it,hadpaused tograsp that title’s meaning, buteverybody
knew, each inhisowncommunity, neighborhood, office orshopand
inhisown unidentified terms, whowould bethemen thatwould
now failtoappear attheir posts onsomecoming morning andwould
silently vanish insearch ofunknown frontiers—themenwhose faces
were tighter than thefaces around them, whose eyesweremore
direct, whose energy wasmore conscientiously enduring—themen
whowerenow slipping away, onebyone,from everycomer ofthe
country— -ofthecountry' which wasnow likethedescendant ofwhat
hadoncebeen regal glory, prostrated bythescourge ofhemophilia,
losing thebestofitsblood lrom awound nottobehealed
“But we’re willing tonegotiate!” yelledMrThompson tohisassis-
tants, ordering thespecial announcement toberepeated byallradio
stations three times aday“We’re willing tonegotiate! Hell hear
it1He’ll answer!”
Special listeners were ordered tokeep watch, uavand night, at
radio receivers tuned toevery known frequency ofsound, waiting
torananswer from anunknown transmitter. There wasnoanswer.
Umpty, hopeless, unfocused faces werebecoming more apparent
mthestreets ofthe cities, butnoonecould read theirmeaning. As
somemenwere escaping with their bodies intotheunderground of
uninhabited regions, soothers could only save their souls andwere
escaping into theunderground oftheir minds—andnopower on
earth could tellwhether their blankly indilferent eyeswere shutters
protecting hidden treasures atthebottom ofshafts nolonger tobe
mined, orweremerely gaping holes oftheparasite’s emptiness never
tobefilled.
“Idon’tknow what todo,” said theassistant superintendent of
anoilrefinery, refusing toaccept thejobofthesuperintendent who
hadvanished—andtheagents oftheUnification Board were unable
totellwhether heliedornot. Itwasonly anedge ofprecision m
thetone ofhisvoice, anabsence otapology orshame, thatmade
themwonder whether hewas arebel orafool. Itwasdangerous to
force thejoboneither.
“Give usmen!” Thepleabegan tohammer progressively louder
upon thedesk oftheUnification Board, from allparts ofacountry
ravaged byunemployment, andneither thepleaders northeBoard
dared toaddthedangerous words which thecrywasimplying: ‘‘Give
usmenofability!” There were waiting lines years* long forthejobs
989
ofjanitors, greasers, porters andbusboys; therewasnoonetoapply
forthejobsofexecutives, managers, superintendents, engineers.
Theexplosions ofoilrefineries, thecrashes ofdefective airplanes,
thebreak-outs ofblast furnaces, thewrecks ofcolliding trains, andthe
rumors ofdrunken orgies intheoffices ofnewly created executives,
made themembers oftheBoard fearthekind ofmenwhodidapply
forthepositions ofresponsibility.
“Don’t despair! Don’t giveup!” said official broadcasts onDecem-
ber 15,andonevery daythereafter. “We willreach anagreement
withJohn Galt.We willgethim tolead us.Hewillsolve allour
problems. Hewillmake things work. Don’t give up!We will get
John Galt!”
Rewards andhonors were offered toapplicants formanagerial
jobs—then toforemen—then toskilled mechanics—then toanyman
whowould make aneffort todeserve apromotion inrank: wage
raises, bonuses, taxexemptions and amedal devised byWesley
Mouch, tobeknown as“The Order ofPublic Benefactors.” it
brought noresults. Ragged people listened totheoffers ofmaterial
comforts andturned away with lethargic indifference, asiftheyhad
losttheconcept of“Value.” These,thought thepublic-pulse-takers
with terror, weremenwho didnotcare tolive—ormenwho did
notcare toliveonpresent terms.
“Don’t despair! Don’t give up!John Galt willsolve ourprob-
lems!” said theradio voices ofofficial broadcasts, traveling through
thesilence offalling snow intothesilence ofunheated homes.
“Don’t tellthem thatwchaven’t gothim!” cried Mr.Thompson
tohisassistants. “But forGod's sake tellthem tofindhim!” Squads
ofChick Morrison’s boyswere assigned tothetaskofmanufacturing
rumors: halfofthem went spreading thestory thatJohn Galtwas
inWashington and inconference withgovernment officials -while
theother halfwent spreading thestory that thegovernment would
give fivehundred thousand dollars asreward forinformation that
would help tofindJohn Galt.
“No, notaclue,” saidWesley Mouch toMr.Thompson, summing
upthereports ofthespecial agents whohadbeen sent tocheck on
every man bythename ofJohn Gall throughout thecountry.
“They’re ashabby lot.There’s aJohn Galt who’s aprofessor of
ornithology, eighty years old— -there’s aretired greengrocer with a
wifeandnine children—there’s anunskilled railroad laborer who’s
held thesame jobfortwelve years—andother such trash.”
“Don’t despair! We willgetJohn Galt!” said official broadcasts
inthedaytime—but atnight, every houronthehour, byasecret,
official order, anappeal wassentIrom $hort-wavc transmitters into
theempty reaches ofspace: “Calling John Galt! . . .Calling John

When theworkers ofafactory beatuptheirforeman andwrecked
themachinery inafitofdespair—noaction could betaken against
them. Arrests were futile, the jailswere full,thearresting officers
winked attheir prisoners and letthem escape ontheirway to
prison—menwere going through themotions prescribed forthemo-
ment, withnothought ofthemoment tofollow. Noaction could be
taken when mobs ofstarving people attacked warehouses onthe
outskirts ofcities.Noaction could betakenwhen punitive squadrons
joined thepeople theyhadbeen sent topunish.
“Are you listening, John Gall? ...Wewish tonegotiate. We

There were whispered rumors ofcovered wagons traveling by
night through abandoned trails, andofsecret settlements armed to
resist theattacks ofthosewhom they called the“Indians”—theat-
tacks ofanylooting savages, betheyhomeless mobs orgovernment
agents. Lights were seen, once inawhile, onthedistant horizon of
aprairie, inthe hills,ontheledges ofmountains, vvheie nobuildings
hadbeenknown toexist Butnosoldiers could bepersuaded to
investigate thesources ofthose lights.
Onthedoors ofabandoned houses, onthegates ofcrumbling
factories, onthewalls ofgovernment buddings, there-appeared, once
inawhile, traced inchalk, inpaint, inblood, thecurving mark which

Theshaft ofredsmoke thatshot totheskyonthenight ofJanuary
22andstood abnormally still forawhile, like asolemn memorial
obelisk, thenwavered andswept backand forth across thesky, like
asearchlight sending some undecipherable message, thenwent out
asabruptly as ithadcome, marked theendofReardon Steel—but
theinhabitants oftheareadidnotknow' it. theylearned itonlyon
subsequent nights, when they—whohadcursed themills forthe
smoke, thefumes, thesootandthenoise—looked outand, instead
oftheglow pulsating with lifeontheir familiar horizon, theysawa
black void.
The millshadbeen nationalized, astheproperty ofadeserter.
The firstbearer ofthe titleof‘People's Manager,” appointed torun
themills, hadbeen aman oftheOrien Boyle faction, apudgy
hanger-on ofthemetallurgical industry, whohadwanted nothing but
tofollow hisemployees while going through themotions ofleading.
But attheendofamonth, after toomany clashes withtheworkers,
toomany occasions when hisonlyanswer hadbeen thathecouldn’t
help it,toomany undelivered orders, toomany telephonic pressures
from hisbuddies, hehadbegged tobetransferred tosome other
position. TheOrren Boyle faction hadbeen tailing apaif, since Mr.
Boyle hadbeen confined toaresthome, where hisdoctor hadforbid-
denhimanycontact with business andhadputhim tothejobof
991
weaving baskets, asameans ofoccupational therapy.. Thesecond
-‘People’s Manager” sent toRearden Steel hadbelonged tothefac-
tionofCuffy Meigs. Hehadworn leather leggings andperfumed
hair lotions, hehadcome towork with agunonhiship,hehad
keptsnapping that discipline was hisprimary goalandthatbyGod
he’d get itorelse.Theonly discernible ruleofthediscipline had
been hisorder forbidding allquestions. After weeks offrantic activ-
ityonthepartofinsurance companies, offiremen, ofambulances
andoffirst-aid units, attending toaseries ofinexplicable accidents—
the“People’s Manager” hadvanished onemorning, having soldand
shipped tosundry racketeers ofEurope andLatin America most of
thecranes, theautomatic conveyors, thesupplies ofrefractory brick,
theemergency power generator, andthecarpet fromwhathadonce
been Rearden’s office.
Noonehadbeen able tountangle theissues intheviolent chaos
ofthenextfewdays—theissues hadnever beennamed, thesides
hadremained unacknowledged, buteveryone hadknown thatthe
bloody encounters between theolder woikers andthenewer had
notbeen driven tosuch ferocious intensity bythe trivial causes that
kept setting them off—neither guards norpolicemen norstate troop-
ershadbeen able tokeep order forthelength ofaday—norcould
anyfaction muster acandidate willing toaccept thepostof“People's
Manager.” OnJanuary 22,theoperations ofRearden Steelhadbeen
ordered temporarily suspended.
The shaft ofredsmoke, that night, hadbeen caused byasixty-
year-old worker, whohad setfiretooneofthestructures andhad
been caught intheact,laughing dazedly andstaring attheflames.
“Toavenge Hank Rearden!” hehadcried defiantly, tears running
down hisfurnace-tanned face.
Don’t let ithurtyou like this—thought Dagny, slumped across her
desk, over thepage ofthenewspaper where asingle briefparagraph
announced the“temporary” endofRearden Steel—don’t let ithurt

inanymanner whatever. ..Then shesat still,withnosightand

Onthenight ofFebruary 3,ayoung pilotwas flying hisusual
route, aweekly flight from Dallas toNewYork City.When he

reached theempty darkness beyond Philadelphia— intheplace
where theflames ofRearden Steel had foryears been hisfavorite
landmark, hisgreeting intheloneliness ofnight, thebeacon ofa
living earth—hesawasnow-covered spread, dead-white andphos-
phorescent inthestarlight, aspread ofpeaks andcraters thatlooked
likethesurface ofthemoon. Hequit hisjob.nextmorning.
Through thefrozen nights, over dying cities, knocking invain at
unanswering windows, beating onunechoing walls, rising above the
roofs oflightless buildings andtheskeletal girders ofruins, theplea
wentoncrying through space, crying tothestationary motion ofthe
stars, totheheatless fireoftheir twinkling: “Can youhear us,John
Galt?Canyouhearus?”
“Miss Taggart, wedon’tknow what todo.” saidMr.Thompson:
hehadsummoned hertoapersonal conference ononeofhisscurry-
ingtrips toNew York. “We'ie ready togive in,tomeet histerms,
tolethimtakeover— butwhere ishe?”
“For thethird time,” shesaid, herlaceandvoice shut tight against
anyfissure ofemotion, “Idonotknow where heisWhatmade you

“Well, 1didn’t know, 1hadtotry . .Ithought, just incase . . .

“Ihaven’t.”

“Ifhe’donlyagree toaconference, justaconference, itwouldn’t

“You’ve heard hisspeech.”

"But, MissTaggart—”
"Ididn't come here toargue.”
Shewas atthedoorwhen hesighed and said, "Ihope he’s still

Amoment passed before shewasable toask,"Who?” and to

From behind therotted posts ofwhat hadonce been acorner
vegetable stand, Dagny glanced furtively back atthestreet: therare
lamp posts broke thestreet intoseparate islands, shecould seea
pawnshop inthe firstpatch oflight, asaloon inthenext, achurch
inthefarthest, andblack gapsbetween them; thesidewalks were
deserted; itwashard totell,butthestreet seemed empty.
Sheturned thecorner, with deliberately resonant steps, then
stopped abruptly tolisten: itwashard totellwhether theabnormal
tightness inside herchest wasthesound ofherown heartbeats, and
hard todistinguish itfrom thesound ofdistant wheels andfrom the
glassy rustle which wastheEastRiver sopiewhere dose by;butshe
heard nosound ofhuman steps behind he*.Shejerked hershoulders,
itwaspart-shrug, part-shudder, andshewalked faster.Arusty clock

Thefearofbeing followed didnotseeirf fully real, asnofearcould

would feel,shethought; justthemotion andthegoal, nothing else.
Shethought itvaguely, distantly, asifherownperson were unreal;
only theword “naked” seemed toreach her:naked ...stripped of
allconcern butforthetarget .. .forthenumber “367 ”thenumber

Shehadcalled ameeting oftheTerminal track laborers forthe

“Was everyone present?” shehadasked theforeman. “Ytah,1guess

Shehadloitered attheTerminal entrances, watching }hemen as
theycame towork. Buttherewere toomany entrances tocover and
noplace where shecould watch while remaining unseen— shehad
stood inthesoggy twilight onasidewalk glittering with rain, pressed
tothewallofawarehouse, hercoat collar raised tohercheekbones,
raindrops falling offthebrim ofherhat—shehadstood exposed to
thesight ofthestreet, knowing that theglances ofthemenwho

thather vigilwastoodangerously obvious. Ifthere wasaJohn Galt

there wasnoJohn Galtamong them ... ifthere wasnoJohn Galt

Nodanger andnoworld, shethought—asshewalked through the
streets oftheslums toward ahouse with thenumber “367/’ which

nothing buttheicydetachment oflightwithout heatorofcognition

Somememory kept struggling toreach her,thencame back: its

Then, abruptly, itceased tomatter; she feltapeculiar shock, like
theshock ofsudden silence, asense ofstillness within her,which

“You won't. But—yes,even that.Youdon’t think it'sindifference,
doyou?Was itindifference thatbroke youandbrought youhere?”
“I—”Andthen theviolence ofthetruthmade herpull hismouth
down tohers, then throw thewords athisface: ”1didn't care
whether either oneofuslived afterwards, justtoseeyou thisonce!”
“Iwould havebeen disappointed ifyouhadn't come.”
“Doyouknow what itwas like, waiting, fighting it,delaying it
onemore day,thenonemore, then—”
Hechuckled. “Do I?”hesaid softly.
Herhand dropped inahelpless gesture: shethought ofhisten
years.“When 1heard your voice ontheradio,” shesaid,“when I
heard thegreatest statement 1ever .. .No, 1havenoright totell
youwhat Ithought ofit.”
“Why not?”
“You think that Ihaven’t accepted it.”
“You will.”
“Were youspeaking from here?”
“No,from thevalley.”
“And thenyourelumed toNewYork?”
“The nextmorning.”
“And you've been hereever since?”
“Yes.”
“Have youheard thekind ofappeals they're sending outtoyou
every night?”
“Sure.”
Sheglanced slowly about theroom, hereyesmoving from the
towers ofthecity inthewindow tothewooden rafters o(hisceiling,
tothecracked plaster ofhiswalls, totheiron posts ofhisbed.
“You’ve been here allthattime,” shesaid.“You've lived here for
twelve years . ..here .. .like this .
“Like this,” hesaid, throwing open thedoor attheendofthe
room.
Shegasped: thelong, light-flooded, windowless space beyond the
threshold, enclosed inashell ofsoftly lustrous metal, like asmall
ballroom aboard asubmarine, wasthemost efficiently modern labo-
ratory shehadever seen.
“Come in,”hesaid, grinning. “Idon’t have tokeep secrets from
youanylonger.”
Itwasvlikecrossing theborder intoadifferent universe. Shelooked
atthecomplex equipment sparkling inabright, diffused glow, atthe
mesh ofglittering wires, attheblackboard chalked withmathemati-
calformulas, atthelongcounters ofobjects shaped bytheruthless
discipline ofapurpose—then atthesagging boards andcrumbling
plaster ofthegarret, Either-or, shethought^ thiswasthechoice con-
fronting theworld: ahuman soul intheimafcc ofoneoroftheother.
“You wanted toknow where 1worked foreleven months outof
theyear,” hesaid. !
“AH this,” sheasked, pointing atthelaboratory, “onthesalary
of’—shepointed atthegarret— “ofanunskilled laborer?”
“Oh, no!Ontheroyalties Midas Mulligan paysmeforhispower-

jobsofthatkind.”
“Then ..,thenwhydidyouhave towork asatrack laborer?”
“Because nomoney earned inthevalley isever tobespent
outside.”^
“Where didyougetthisequipment?”
“Idesigned it.Andrew Stockton’s foundry made it.”Hepointed
toanunobtrusive object thesizeofaradio cabinet inacomer of
theroom: “ITiere’s themotor youwanted,” andchuckled ather
gasp, attheinvoluntary joltthatthrew herforward. “Don’t bother
studying it,youwon’t give itaway tothem now.”
Shewasstaring attheshining metal cylinders andtheglistening
coils ofwire thatsuggested therusted shape resting, likeasacred
relic, inaglass coffin inavault oftheTaggart Terminal.
“Itsupplies myown electric power forthelaboratory,” hesaid.
“Noonehashadtowonder whyatrack laborer isusing such exorbi-
tantamounts ofelectricity.”
“But iftheyeverfound thisplace—”
Hegaveanodd, brief chuckle. “They won t.”
“How longhaveyoubeen—?”
Shestopped; thistime, shedidnotgasp; thesight confronting her
could notbegreeted byanything except amoment oftotal inner
stillness: onthewall, behind arow olmachinery, shesawapicture
cutoutofanewspaper— apicture ofher, inslacks and shirt, standing
bythesideoftheengine attheopening oftheJohn Galt Line, her
head lifted, hersmile holding thecontext, themeaning andthesun-
lightofthatday.
Amoan washeronlyanswer, assheturned tohim.butthelook

“fwasthesymbol ofwhatyouwanted todestroy intheworld.”
hesaid.“Butyouweremysymbol ofwhat Iwanted toachieve.”
Hepointed atthepictuie. “Ihis ishowmen expect tofeelabout
their lifeonce ortwice, asanexception, inthecourse oftheir life-
time. But I—this iswhat Jchose astheconstant andnormal.”
Thelookonhisface, theserene intensity ofhiseyesandofhis
mindmade itrealtoher,now, inthismoment, inthismoment’s full
context, inthis city.
When hekissed her,sheknew that their arms, holding each other,
were holding then greatest triumph, that thiswasthe reality un-
touched bypain orfear, thereality ofHalley’s Fifth Concerto, this
wasthereward theyhadwanted, fought torandwon.
Thedoorbell rang.
Her firstreaction was todraw back, his—tohold hercloser and
longer.
When heraised hishead, hewassmiling. Hesaid only,“Now is
thetimenottobeafraid.”
Shefollowed himback tothegarret. Sheheard thedoor ofthe
laboratory clicking locked behind them.
Heheldhercoat forher silently, hewaited until shehadtied its
beltandputonherhat—thenhewalked totheentrance doorand
opened it.

Three ofthefourmenwhoentered were muscular figures inmili-
tary uniforms, each withtwogunsonhiships, withbroad faces
devoid ofshape andeyesuntouched byperception, lirefourth, their
leader, wasafrail civilian withanexpensive overcoat, aneatmus-
tache, paleblueeyesandthemanner ofanintellectual ofthepublic-
relations species.
Heblinked atGalt, attheroom, made astepforward, stopped,
made another stepandstopped.
“Yes?’' said Galt.
“Arc . . .areyouJohn Galt?” heasked tooloudly.
“That’s myname.”
“AreyoutheJohn Galt?”
“Which one?”
“Did youspeak ontheradio?”
“When9”
“Don’t lethim foolyou.” Themetallic voice wasDagny’s and it
wasaddressed totheleader. “He—is—John—Galt. 1shall report the
proof toheadquarters. Youmayproceed.”
Galt turned toherastoastranger. “Will you tellmenow just
whoyouareandwhat itwas thatyouwanted here?”
Herfacewas asblank asthefaces ofthesoldiers. “Myname is
Dagny Taggart. 1wanted toconvince myself thatyouaretheman
whom thecountry isseeking”
Heturned totheleader. “All right,” hesaid “IamJohnGalt— but
ifyouwantmetoanswer you atall,keep your stool pigeon”—he
pointed atDagny—“away from me.”
“Mr. Galt!” cried theleader with thesound ofanenormous jovial-
ity.4*ltisanhonor tomeet you,anhonor andaprivilege! Please,
Mr.Galt, don’t misunderstand us—we’re ready togrant youyour
wishes—no,ofcourse, youdon't have todealwithMiss Taggart, it
youprefer notto—MissTaggart wasonly trying todoherpatriotic
duty, but—”
“Isaidkeep heraway fromme.”
“We’re notyour enemies, MrGalt, Iassure youwe’re notyour
enemies.” Heturned toDagny. “Miss Taggart, youhavepcrlormed
aninvaluable service tothepeople. Youhave earned thehighest
form ofpublic gratitude. Permit ustotakeoverfrom hereon.”The
soothing motions ofhishands were urging hertostand back, tokeep
outofGalt’s sight.
“Now whatdoyouwant?” asked Galt.
“The nation iswaiting foryou,Mr.Galt. Allwewant isachance
todispel misapprehensions. Just achance toco-operate with you.”
Hisgloved hand waswaving asignal tohisthree men; thefloor-
boards creaked, asthemenproceeded silently tothetaskofopening
drawers and closets; theywere searching $ieroom. “The spirit of
thenation willrevive tomorrow morning. ^Ir.Galt,when theyhear
thatyouhavebeen found.”
“What doyouwant?”
“Just togreet you inthename ofthepeople.”
“Am Iunder arrest?”
“Why think insuchold-fashioned terms? Ourjob isonly toescort
1002
yousafely tothetopcouncils ofthenational leadership, where your
presence isurgently needed.” Hepaused, butgotnoanswer. ‘The
country’s topleaders desire toconfer withyou— justtoconfer and
toreach afriendly understanding.”
The soldiers were finding nothing butgarments andkitchen uten-
sils;therewerenoletters, nobooks, noteven anewspaper, asifthe
room were thehabitation ofanilliterate.
“Our objective isonly toassist youtoassume your rightful placemsociety, Mr.Galt.Youdonotseem torealize yourown public
value.”Tdo.”
“We arehere only toprotect you.”
“Locked!” declared asoldier, banging his fistagainst thelabora-
torydoor.
Theleader assumed aningratiating smile. “What isbehind that
door, Mr.Galt?”
“Private property.”
“Would youopen it,please?”
“No”
The leader spread hishands out inagesture ofpained help-
lessness. “Unfortunately, myhands aretied.Orders, youknow.We
have toenter thatroom”
“Enter it.”
“It’s only aformality, amere formality. There’s noreason why
things should notbehandled amicably. Won’t youplease co-operate?”
“1said, no.”
“I’m sureyouwouldn’t want ustoresoil toan> . ..unnecessary
means.” Hegotnoanswer. “We have theauthority tobreak that
doordown, youknow—but,ofcourse, wewouldn’t want todoit.”
Hewaited, butgotnoanswer. “Force that lock!” hesnapped to
thesoldier.
Dagny glanced atGalt’s face.Hestood impassively, hishead held
level, shesawtheundisturbed lines ofhisprofile, hiseyes directed
atthedoor.The lockwasasmall, square plate ofpolished copper,
without keyhole orfixtuies.
The silence andthesudden immobility ofthethree brutes were
involuntary, while theburglar stools inthehands ofthefourth were
grating cautiously against thewood ofthedoor.
Thewood gaveway easily, andsmall chips felldown, their thuds
magnified bythesilence into therattle ofadistant gun.When the
burglar’s jimmy attacked thecopper plate, theyheard afaint rustle
behind thedoor,nolouder than thesigh ofaweary mind. Inanother
minute, thelock felloutandthedooishuddered torward thewidth
ofaninch.
Thesoldier jumped back.Theleader approached, hissteps irregu-
larlikehiccoughs, andthrew thedooropen.They faced ablack hole
ofunknown content andunrelieved darkness.
They glanced atoneanother and atGalt; hedidnotmove; he
stood looking atthedarkness.
Dagny followed them,when theystepped over thethreshold, pre-
U)03
ceded bythebeams oftheir flashlights. Thespace beyond wasalong
shell ofmetal, empty butforheavy drifts ofdustonthefloor, an
odd, grayish-white dust thatseemed tobelong among ruins undis-
turbed forcenturies. Theroom looked dead likeanempty skull.
Sheturned away, nottoletthem see inherface thescream of
theknowledge ofwhat thatdusthadbeen afewminutes ago.Don’t
trytoopen thatdoor, hehad said toher attheentrance tothe
powerhouse ofAtlantis ... ifyoutried tobreak itdown, themachin-
eryinside would collapse intorubble long before thedoorwould
giveway. . . .Don’t trytoopen thatdoor—shewasthinking, but
knew thatwhat shewasnowseeing wasthevisual form ofthestate-
ment: Don’t trytoforce amind.
Themenbacked out insilence andwentonbacking toward the
exitdoor, thenstopped uncertainly, one after another, atrandom
points ofthegarret, asifabandoned byareceding tide.
“Well,” said Gait, reaching torhisovercoat andturning tothe
leader, “let’s go.”

Three floors oftheWayne-Falkland Hotel hadbeen evacuated
andtransformed intoanarmed camp. Guards withmachine guns
stood atevery turnofthelong, velvet-caipeted corridors. Sentinels
withbayonets stood onthelandings olthefire-stairways. The eleva-
tordoors ofthefifty-ninth, sixtieth and sixty-first floors were pad-
locked; asingle door andoneelevator were leftassolemeans of
access, guarded bysoldiers infullbattle regalia Peculiar-looking
men loitered inthelobbies, restaurants andshops oftheground
floor: their clothes were toonewandtooexpensive, inunsuccessful
imitation ofthehotel’s usual patrons, acamouflage impaired bythe
factthattheclothes were badly fitted totheir wearers’ husky figures
andwere further distorted bybulges inplaces wheie thegarments
ofbusinessmen havenocause tobulge, butthegarments ofgunmen
have.Groups ofguards withTommy gunswere posted atevery en-
trance and exitofthehotel, aswell asatstrategic windows ofthe
adjoining streets.
Inthecenter olthiscamp, onthesixtieth floor, inwhatwasknown
astheroyal suite oftheWayne-Falkiand Hotel, amidst satin drapes,
crystal candelabra andsculptured garlands offlowers. John Galt,
dressed mslacks and shirt, satinabrocaded armchair, one leg
stretched outonavelvet hassock, hishands crossed behind hishead,
looking attheceiling.
Thiswastheposture inwhich Mr.Thompson found him,when
thefourguards, whostood outside thedoor oftheroyal suite since
fivea.m,opened itateleven am. toadmit Mr.Thompson, and
locked itagain.
Mr.Thompson experienced abrief flash jofuneasiness when the
click ofthelock cutoffhisescape and leftjhimalone with thepris-
oner, Butheremembered thenewspaper deadlines dndtheradio
voices, which hadbeenannouncing tothecountry sincedawn; “John
Galt isfound!—John Galt isinNewYork!—John Galt hasjoined
thepeople’s cause!—John Galt isinconference with thecountry’s
1004
leaders, working foraspeedy solution ofallourproblems!”— and
hemade himself feel thathebelieved it.
“Well, well, well!” hesaid brightly, marching uptothearmchair.
“Soyou’re theyoung fellow who’s started allthetrouble— Oh,” he
saidsuddenly, ashegotacloser look atthedarkgreen eyeswatching
him.“Well, I...I’mtickled pink tomeet you,Mr.Galt, justtickled
pink.” Headded,‘Tm Mr.Thompson, youknow.”
“How doyoudo,” said Galt.
Mr.Thompson thudded down onachair, thebrusqueness ofthe
movement suggesting acheerily businesslike attitude. “Now don’tgo
imagining that you’re under arrest orsome such nonsense.” He
pointed attheroom. “This isnojail, asyoucansee.Youcansee
that we’ll treatyou right. You're abigperson, avery bigperson—
andweknow it.Justmake yourself athome. Ask foranything you
please. Fireanyflunky that doesn't obey you.And ifyoutake a
dislike toanyofthearmy boys outside, justbreathe theword—and
we’llsend another onetoreplace him.”
Hepaused expectantly. Hereceived noanswer.
“ITie onlyreason webrought youhere isjust thatwewanted to
talktoyou.Wewouldn’t havedone itthisway, butyou leftusno
choice. You kept hiding. And allwewanted wasachance totell
you thatyougotusallwrong”
Hespread hishands out,palms up,withadisarming smile. Galt’s
eyeswere watching him,without answer.
“That wassome speech youmade. Hoy. areyouanorator! You’ve
donesomething tothecountry— Idon'tknow what orwhy, butyou
have. People seem towant something you've got.Butyouthought
we'dbedead setagainst it?That’s where you're wrong. We're not.
Personally, Ithink there wasplenty inthatspeech thatmade sense.
Yes, sir, Ido.Ofcourse, 1don’t agree withevery word yousaid—
butwhat thehell,youdon't expect ustoagree with everything, do
you? Differences ofopinion- -that’s whatmakes horse racing. Me,
I'malways willing tochange mymind.Pmopen toanyargument.”
Heleaned forward invitingly. Heobtained noanswer.
“The world isinahellofamess. Just asyou said.There, Iagree
with you.Wehave apoint incommon. Wecan starttrom that.
Something’s gottobedone about it.All Iwanted was—Look,” he
cried suddenly, “why don’t you letmetalktoyou?”
“You aretalking tome.”
“I .,.well, that is . . .well,youknow what Imean.”
“Fully.”
“Well? .. .Well, what haveyougottosay?”
“Nothing.”
“Huh?!”
“Nothing.”
“Oh,come now!”
“Ididn’t seek totalk toyou.”
“But ...butlook! ...wehave things todiscuss!”
“Ihaven’t.”
“Look,” said4Mr.Thompson, after apause, “you’re amanofac-
1005
lion.Apractical man. Boy, areyouapractical man!Whatever else
Idon't quite getabout you, I’msureofthat.Now aren't you?”
‘Practical? Yes.”
‘‘Well, soam I.Wecantalk straight. Wecanputourcardsonthe

“I’m always open toadeal.”
.
“Iknew it!”cried Mr.Thompson triumphantly, slamming his fist
down onhisown knee. “Itoldthem so—allthose fool intellectual
theorizers, likeWesley!”
“I’m always open toadeal—withanyone who hasavalue to
offerme."
Mr.Thompson could not tellwhatmade himmiss abeat before
heanswered, “Well, write yourown ticket, brother! Write your
own ticket!”
“What haveyougottoofferme?”
“Why—anything.”
“Such as?”
“Anything youname. Have youheard ourshort-wave broadcasts
toyou?”
“Yes.”
“We said we’llmeet your terms, anyterms.Wemeant it.”
“Have youheardmesayon(heradio that 1havenoteims to
bargain about? 1meant it.”
“Oh. butlook,youmisunderstood us!Youthought we’d fight you.
Butwewon’t. We’re notthat rigid.WeYe willing toconsider any

“Why should I?”
“Because ..because wewanted tospeak toyou inthename ol

“Idon lrecognize your right tospeak inthename ofthecountry.”
“Now look here. I'mnotused to . . .Well, okay, won’t you just
givemeahearing? Won’t youlisten?”
“I’m listening.”
“The country isinaterrible state. People arcstarving andgiving
up,theeconomy isfalling topieces, nobody isproducing anylonger.
Wedon’tknow what todoabout it.You do.Youknowhow to
make things work. Okay, we’re ready togive in.Wewantyou to

“1toldyouwhat todo.”
“What?”
“Get outoftheway.”
“That’s impossible! That's fantastic! That’s outofthequestion!”
“You see9Itoldyouwehadnothing todiscuss.”
“Now. wait! Wait! Don't gotoextremes! There’s always amiddle
ground You can’t have everything. Weafen’t . ..people aren’t
ready for it.You can’t expect ustoditch themachinery ofState.
We’ve gottopreserve thesystem. Butwd’rc willing toamend It.
We’ll modify itanywayyouwish. We’re dotstubborn, theoretical
dogmatists—we’re flexible, We’lldoanything yousay.We’ll giveyou

We’ll keep thesphere ofpolitics andgiveyOu totalpower over the

Galt burst outlaughing.
Itwasthesimple amusement ofthelaughter thatshocked Mr.
Thompson. “What’s thematter withyou?”
“So that’s your idea ofacompromise, isit?”
“What’s the .. .?Don’t sitthere grinning like that! ... Idon’t

“Atthepoint ofagun?”
“Now look, 1 .. .Now what’s sodamn funny about it?”
“Will you tellmejustone thing: ifyou’re able topretend that

“Idon’tknow what youmean!i—”
“Skip it.Itwas justarhetorical question. The firstpart ofitan-

“Huh?”
“Idon't playyourkindofgames, brother— ifyouwant atranslation.”
“Doyoumean thatyou’re refusing myoffer?”
“Iam.”
“Butwhy?”
“Ittookmethree hours ontheradio totellyouwhy.”
“Oh, that’s justtheory! I'mtalking business. I'moffering youthe

“What Itoldyou, inthree hours, wasthat itwon’t work.”
“You canmake itwork.”
“How?”
Mr,Thompson spread hishands out. “Idon’t know. IfIdid, l

genius. Youcansolve anything.”
“Isaid itcan’t bedone.”
“Youcould doit.”
“How?”
“Somehow,” Heheard Galt’s chuckle, andadded. “Why not? Just
tellmewhynot?”
“Okay, I’lltellyou.YouwantmetobetheEconomic Dictator?”
“Yes!”
1007
“And you’ll obey anyorder Igive?”
“Implicitly!”
“Then startbyabolishing allincome taxes.”
“Oh, no!”screamed Mr.Thompson, leaping tohisfeet.“We couldn't
dothat! That’s ...that's notthe fieldofproduction. That’s the field
ofdistribution. Howwould wepaygovernment employees?”
“Fire yourgovernment employees.”
“Oh, no!That's politics! That’s noteconomics! You can’t interfere
with politics! You can’t have everything!”
Gaitcrossed hislegsonthehassock, stretching himself morecom-
fortably inthebrocaded armchair. “Want tocontinue thediscussion?
Ordoyougetthepoint?”
“Ionly—”Hestopped.
“Are you satisfied that Igotthepoint?”
“Look,” saidMr.Thompson placatingly, resuming theedge ofhis
seat. “Idon't want toargue. Finnogood atdebates. I’maman of
action. Time isshort. All Iknow isthatyou’ve gotamind. Justthe
sortofmindweneed.Youcandoanything. Youcouldmake things
work ifyouwanted to.”
“All right, put ityourownway: Idon’t want to. 1don’t want to

forpeople tobefree—which anyrational human being would throw

“Tellme,” saidMr.Thompson, looking athim reflectively, “what

“Itoldyouontheradio.”
“Idon’t get it.You said thatyou’re outforyourown selfish inter-

“Because there arenofunds behind your blank check.”
“W/iar?”
“Because youhavenovalue toofferme.”
“Icanofferyouanything youcanask.Justname it.”
“Youname it.”
“Well, youtalked alotabout wealth. Ifit’smoney thatyouwant—

“After /teach them todoit?”
“Ifyouwant anything foryourowngang— for allthosemen
who’ve disappeared —jobs, positions, authority, taxexemptions, any
special favor atailjustname itand they’ll get it.”
“After /bringthem back?”
“Well, whatonearth doyouwant?”
“What onearthdo Ineedyoufor?”
“Huh?”
“What haveyougottooffermethat 1couldn’t getwithout you?”
There wasadifferent look inMr.Thompson’s eyeswhen hedrew
back, asifcornered, yetlooked straight atGalt forthe firsttime
andsaid slowly, “Without me,youcouldn’t getoutofthisroom,
rightnow.”
Galt smiled. “True.”
“You wouldn't beable toproduce anything. Youcould beleft
here tostarve.”
“True.”
“Well, don’tyousee?”Theloudness ofhomey joviality came back
intoMr.Thompson’s voice, asifthehintgiven andreceived were
now tobesafely evaded bymeans ofhumor. “What I’vegottoolfer
you isyour life.”
“It’s notyours tooffer, Mr.Thompson.” saidGalt softly.
Something about hisvoicemade Mr,Thompson jerk toglance at
him,then jerk faster tolookaway, Galt’s smileseemed almost gentle
“Now,” said Galt, “doyouseewhat 1mean when Isaid thata
zero can’t hold amortgage over life? It's lwho’d have togrant you
thatkind ofmortgage—and Idon’t. Theremoval ofathreat isnot
apayment, thenegation ofanegative isnotareward, thewithdrawal
ofyourarmed hoodlums isnotanincentive, theoffer nottomurder
me isnotavalue.”
“Who .. .who's saidanything about murdering you*”
“Who’s saidanything about anything else? Ifyouweren’t holding
mehere atthepoint otagun,under threat ofdeath, youwouldn't
have achance tospeak tomeatall.And that isasmuch asyour
gunscanaccomplish. Idon’t payfortheremoval ofthreats. Idon't
buymy lifefrom anyone.”
“That’s nottrue,” saidMr.Thompson brightly, “Ifyouhad a
broken leg,you’d payadoctor tosetit.”
“Not ifhewastheonewhobroke it.”Hesmiled atMr.Thomp-
son’s silence. “I’m apractical man, Mr.Thompson. 1don't think it’s
practical toestablish aperson whose solemeans oflivelihood is
thebreaking ofmybones. Idon’t think it'spractical tosupport a
protection racket,”
Mr.Thompson looked thoughtful, thenshook hishead. “Idon’t
think you’re practical,” hesaid.“Apractical mandoesn't ignore the
factsofreality. Hedoesn’t waste histimewishing things tobediffer-
entortrying tochange them.Hetakes things asthey are.We’re
holding you. It’safact.Whether you like itornot, it’safact.You
should actaccordingly.”
1009
“Iam.”
'‘What Imean is,youshould co-operate. Youshould recognize an
existing situation, accept itandadjust toit.”
“Ifyouhadblood poisoning, would you adjust to itoractto
change it?”
“Oh, that's different! That’s physical!”
“You mean, physical facts areopen tocorrection, butyourwhims
arenot?”
“Huh?”
“You mean, physical nature canbeadjusted tomen, butyour
whims areabove thelaws ofnature, andmenmust adjust toyou?”
“Imean that 1hold theupper hand!"
“With agun init?”
“Oh, forget about guns! I—”
‘Ican't forget afactofreality, Mr.Thompson. Thatwould be
impractical.'’
“AH right, then: 1hold agun.What areyougoing todoabout it?”
‘i’ll actaccordingly. I'llobey you.”
“What?"
“I’lldowhatever you tellmeto.”
“Doyoumean it?”
“Imean it.Literally .”Hesaw theeagerness ofMr.Thompson’s
faceebbslowly under alook ofbewilderment. ”1willperform any
motion youordermetoperform. Ifyouordermetomove into the
office ofanEconomic Dictator, I'llmove into it.Ifyouordermeto
sitatadesk, Iwill sitat it.Ifyouordermetoissue adirective, I
willissue thedirective youordermetoissue.”
“Oh, but 1don'tknow what directives toissue!”
“1don’t, either.”
There wasalong pause.
“Well 7”said Galt.“What arcyour orders?”
“Iwantyoutosave theeconomy ofthecountry!”
“Idon’tknowhow tosave it.”
“Iwantyoutofindaway!”
“Idon’tknowhow tofind it.”
“1wantyoutothink!”
“How willyourgunmakemedothat,Mr.Thompson7”
Mr.Thompson looked athimsilently— andGalt saw, inthetight-
ened lips, inthejutting chin, inthenarrowed eyes, thelook ofan
adolescent bully about toutter thatphilosophical argument which is
expressed bythesentence: I'llbashyour teeth in.Galt smiled, look-
ingstraight athim, asifhearing theunspoken sentence andunder-
scoring it.Mr.Thompson looked away.
“No,” saidGalt, “you don’t wantmeto?think.When youforce a
man toactagainst hisown choice andjudgment, it’shisthinking
thatyouwanthimtosuspend. Youwant|umtobecome arobot. 1
shallcomply.”
Mr.Thompson sighed. “Idon’t getit,”hesaid inatoneofgenuine
helplessness. “Something’s offand lcan’t figure itout.Why should
youaskfortrouble? With abrain likeyours—you canbeatanybody.
1010
I’mnomatch foryou,andyouknow it.Why don’t youpretend to

Forthesame reason thatmakes youoffer it:because vou’d win”
“Huh?”
Because itstheattempt ofyour betters tobeatyouonyour
terms thathasallowed your kind togetaway with itforcenturies.
Which oneofuswould succeed, ifIwere tocompete withyoufor
control overyourmusclemen? Sure, Icouldpretend— and Iwouldn't

unchallenged absolute that there willalways beanother victim to
find.Butyou’ve found your lastvictim— theonewho refuses toplay
hishistorical part.Thegame isup,brother.”
“Oh. that’s justtheory!” snapped MrThompson, alittle too
sharply; hiseyeswere roving about theroom, inthemanner ofa
substitute forpacing; heglanced atthedoor, asitlonging toescape.
“You saythat ifwedon’t giveupthesystem, we llperish?” heasked.
“Yes.”
“Then, since we’re holding you,you willperish withus?”
“Possibly.”
“Don’t youwant tolive?”
“Passionately.” Hesawthesnap olaspark inMr.Thompson's
eyesandsmiled. “I’ll tellyoumore: Iknow (hat lwant tolivemuch
more intensely thanyoudo. Iknow that that’s what you're counting
on 1know thatyou. infact,donotwant tolive atall. Iwant it.
Andbecause lwant itsomuch, Iwillaccept nosubstitute.”
Mr.Thompson jumped tohisfeet. “That’s nottrue!” hecried.
“My notwanting tolive —it’s nottrue!Whydoyou talk likethat?”
Hestood, hislimbs drawn faintly together, as itagainst asudden
chill.“Why doyousaysuch things? 1don'tknow whatyoumean.”
Hebacked afewsteps away.“And it'snottrue thatI’magunman.
I’mnot. Idon’t intend toharm you Inever intended toharm any-
body. Iwant people tolikeme. 1want tobeyour triend . ..iwant
tobeyour friend!” hecried tothespace atlarge.
Galt’s eyeswere watching him,without expression, giving himno
clue towhat theywere seeing, except thattheywere seeing it.
Mr.Thompson jerked suddenly into bustling, unnecessary motions,
asifheweremahurry. “I've gottorunalong,” hesaid. “I ..,I
have somany appointments. We’ll talkabout itsome more. Think
itover, lake your time. I’mnottrying tohigh-pressure you. Just
relax, take iteasyandmake yourself athome. Ask foranything you
like—food, drinks, cigarettes, thebest ofanything.” Hewaved his
hand atGalt’s garments. “I'm going toorder themost expensive
tailor inthecity tomake some decent clothes foryou. Iwantyou
togetused tothebest. Iwantyoutobecomfortable and ...Say,”
1011
heasked, alittle toocasually, “have yougotanyfamily? Any rela-
tivesyou’d liketosee?”
“No.”
“Any friends?”
“No.”
“Have yougotasweetheart?”
“No.”
“Itsjustthat 1wouldn’t wantyoutogetlonesome. Wecan letyou
have visitors, any visitor youname, ifthere’s anyone youcare for.”
“There isn’t.”
Mr.Thompson paused atthedoor, turned tolook atGalt fora
moment andshook hishead. “Ican’t figure youout,” hesaid. “I
justcan’t figure youout.”
Galt smiled, shrugged andanswered, “Who isJohn Galt?”

Awhirling mesh ofsleethung over theentrance oftheWayne-
Falkland Hotel, andthearmed guards looked oddly, desolately help-
less inthecircle oflight: theystood hunched, heads down, hugging
their guns forwarmth—as if,were they torelease allthespitting
violence oftheir bullets atthestorm, itwould notbring comfort to
their bodies.
From across thestreet. Chick Morrison, theMoiale Conditioner -
onhisway toaconlercnce onthefilly-ninth floor- -noted thatthe
rare, lethargic passers-by were nottaking thetrouble toglance at
theguards, asthey didnottake thetrouble toglance atthesoggy
headlines ofapile otunsold newspaper onthestand ofaragged,
shivering vendor: “John GaltPromises Prosperity.”
Chick Morrison shook hishead uneasily sixdays offront-page
stories—about theunited efforts ofthecountry's leaders working
withJohn Galt toshape new policies- -hadbrought noresults Peo-
pleweremoving, heobserved, asifthey didnotcare tosecanything
around them.Noonetook anynotice ofhisexistence, except a
ragged oldwoman whostretched outherhand tohim silently, ashe
approached the lights oftheentrance; hehurried past,andonly
drops ofsleet tellonthegnarled, naked palm.
Itwas hismemory ofthestreets thatgave ajagged sound toChick
Morrison’s voice, when hespoke toacircle offaces inMr.Thomp-
son’sroom onthefifty-ninth floor. I'helook ofthefaces matched
thesound ofhisvoice.
“Itdoesn’t seem towork.” hesaid, pointing toapileofreports
from hispublic-pulse-takers. “All thepress releases about ourcollab-
orating withJohn Galt don’t seem tomake anydifference. People
don’t care.They don’t believe aword of it;Some ofthem saythat
he’llnever collaborate with us.Most ofthem don't even believe that
we’ve gothim. Idon’tknow what’s happened topeople. They doo’t
believe anything anymore.” Hesighed. “Three factories went out
ofbusiness inCleveland, daybefore yesterday. Five factories closed
inChicago yesterday. InSanFrancisco—”
“Iknow, Iknow,” snapped Mr.Thompson, tightening themuffler
around histhroat: thebuilding’s furnace hadgone outoforder.
1012
“There's nochoice about it:he’sgottogive inandtake over. He’s
gotto!”
Wesley Mouch glanced attheceiling. “Don’t askmetotalk to
himagain,” hesaid,andshuddered. “I’ve tried.One can’t talkto
thatroan.”
“I . ..Jcan t,Mr.Thompson!” cried Chick Morrison, inanswer
tothestopofMr.Thompson’s roving glance. “I’ll resign, ifyouwantmeto! 1can’t talktohimagain! Don’t make me!”
“Nobody cantalktohim,” saidDr.Floyd Ferris. “It’s awaste of
time.Hedoesn’t hear aword yousay.”
FredKinnan chuckled. “You mean, hehears toomuch, don’t you?
And what’s worse, heanswers it.”
“Well, whydon’t you try itagain?” snapped Mouch. “You seem
tohaveenjoyed it.Why don’t you trytopersuade him*”
“1know better,” saidKinnan. “Don’t fool yourself, brother. No-
body’s going topersuade him, Iwon ttry ittwice. . . .Enjoyed it?”
headded, with alook ofastonishment. “Yeah . . .veah, fguess
Idid.”
“What’s thematter withyou?Areyou falling forhim?Areyou
letting himwinyouover?”
“Me?” Kinnan chuckled mirthlessly, “What usewould hehave for
me? I’llbethe firstone togodown thedrainwhen hewins. . ..It‘s
only”—heglanced wistfully upattheceiling---“it’s only that he’sa
manwho talks straight."
“He won’t win!” snapped Mr. 'Thompson “It's outofthe
question!”
There was along pause.
“There arehunger riots inWest Virginia,” saidWesley Mouch.
“And thefarmers inTexas have—”
“Mr. ITiompson!” saidChick Morrison desperately. “Maybe .. .
maybe wecould letthepublic seehim... atamass rally...or
maybe onTV . ..justseehim. justsothey'd believe thatwe've

“Too dangerous,” snapped Dr.Ferris. “Don’t lethimcome any-
where near thepublic. There's nolimit towhat he’llpermit himself
todo.”
“He’s gottogive in,”saidMr.Thompson stubbornly. “He’s got
tojoin us.One otyoumust—”
“No!” screamed Eugene Lawson. “Not me! Idon’t want tosee
him atall!Notonce! Idon’t want tohave tobelieve it!”
“What?” asked James Taggart; hisvoice hadanoteofdangerously
reckless mockery; Lawson didnotanswer. “What areyouscared
of?” 'Thecontempt inTaggart’s voice sounded abnormally stressed,
asifthesight ofsomeone's greater fearwere tempting himtodefy
hisown,“What isityou’re scared tobelieve. Gene?”
U
Iwon’t believe it! 1won't!” Lawson’s voice was half-snarl, half-
whimper. “You can’tmakemelosemyfaith iuhumanity! You

“You’re afinebunch ofintellectuals, youare,” saidMr.Thompson
scornfully. “Ithought youcould talk tohim inhisownlingo— but

“Trouble is,hedoesn’t want anything,” saidMouch. “What can

“You mean,” saidKinnan, /‘what canweoffer amanwhowants

“Shut up!"screamed James Taggart. “Why didyousaythat?What

“What made youscream?” asked Kinnan.
“Keep quiet, allofyou!” ordered Mr.Thompson “YouYefine at

“Sohe’sgotyou,too?” yelled Lawson.
“Aw, pipedown,” saidMr.Thompson wearily. “He’s thetoughest

He's ashard astheycome . .The faintest tinge ofadmiration
crept into hisvoice. “Ashard astheycome ...”
“There areways topersuade tough bastards,” diawted Dr.Ferris
casually, “asI’veexplained toyou.”
“No!” cried Mr.Thompson. “No! Shut up! 1won't listen toyou\

The sleet ofthefollowing morning felldownonfront-page stories
announcing that aconstructive, harmonious conference between
John Galtandthecountry’s leaders, ontheprevious afternoon, had
produced “The John Galt Flan,” soon tobeannounced. Thesnow-
flakes oftheevening felldown upon thefurniture ofanapartment
house whose front wallhadcollapsed—andupon acrowd ofmen
waiting silently attheclosed cashier's window ofaplant whose
owner hadvanished
“The farmers ofSouth Dakota,” Wesley Mouch reported toMr.
Thompson, nextmorning, “aremarching onthestate capital, burning
every government building ontheirway,andeveryhome worth more
than tenthousand dollars.”
“California’s blown topieces,” hereported intheevening.
‘There’s acivilwargoing onthere—ifthat’s what itis,which nobody
seems tobesure of.They’ve declared thatthey’re seceding from the
Union, butnobody knows who’snow inpow$r. There’s armed fight-
ingallover thestate, between a‘People’s Parly,’ ledbyMaChalmers
andhersoybean cult ofOrient-admirers-^and something called
‘Back toGod,’ ledbysome former oil-field owners.”
“Miss Taggart!” moaned Mr.Thompson, when sheentered his
1014
hotelroom nextmorning, inanswer tohissummons. “What arewe
going todo?'*
Hewondered whyhehadonce feltthatshepossessed some reas-
suring kind ofenergy. Hewaslooking atablank face thatseemed
composed, butthecomposure became disquieting when onenoticed
that itlasted forminute after minute, withnochange ofexpression
nosignoffeeling. Herfacehadthesame look asalltheothers, he
thought, except forsomething inthesetofthemouth that sug-
gested endurance.
*itrust you.Miss Taggart. You’ve gotmore brains than allmy
boys,” hepleaded. “You’ve donemore forthecountry thananyof
them—it'syouwhofound him for us.What arewetodo?With
everything falling topieces, he’stheonlyonewhocanleadusout
ofthismess—buthewon’t. Herefused. Hesimply refuses tolead.
I’venever seen anything like it:amanwhohasnodesire tocom-
mand.Webeghimtogiveorders— andheanswers thathewants to
obey them! It’spreposterous!”
“Itis.”
“What doyoumake ofit?Canyou figure himout?”
“He’s anarrogant egoist,” she said.“He’s anambitious adven-
turer. He’s amanofunlimited audacity who’s playing forthebiggest
stakes intheworld.”
Itwaseasy, shethought. Itwould havebeen difficult inthatdistant
timewhen shehadregarded language asatoolofhonor, always to
beused asifonewere under oath—anoath olallegiance toreality
andtorespect forhuman beings. Now itwasonlyamatter ofmaking
sounds, inarticulate sounds addressed toinanimate objects unrelated
tosuchconcepts asreality, human orhonor.
Ithadbeen easy, that firstmorning, toreport toMr.Thompson
howshehadtraced John Galt tohishome. Ithadbeen easy towatch
Mr.Thompson's gulping smiles and hisrepeated cries of“Thai’smy
girl!” uttered with glances oftriumph athisassistants, thetriumph
ofamanwhose judgment intrusting herhadbeen vindicated. Ithad
been easy toexpress anangry hatred forGalt “1used toagree
with hisideas, but Iwon tlethimdestroy myrailroad!”— and to
hear Mr.Thompson say,“Don’t youworry. Miss Taggart! WeTl
protect youfrom him!”
Uhadbeen easy toassume alook ofcoldshrewdness and to
remind Mr.Thompson ofthefivc-hundred-thousand-dollar reward,
hervoice clearand cutting, likethesound ofanadding machine
punching outthesum ofabill.Shehadseen aninstant’s pause in
Mr.Thompson’s facial muscles, then abrighter, broader smile—like
asilent speech declaring thathehadnotexpected it,butwasde-
lighted toknow whatmade her tickand that itwasthekind of
licking heunderstood, “Of course. Miss Taggart! Certainly! That
reward isyours—allyours! Thecheck willbesent toyou, infull!”
Ithadbeen easy, because shehad feltasifshewere insome
dreary non-world, where herwords andactions were notfactsany
longer—notreflections ofreality, butonly distorted postures inone
ofthose side-show mirrors thatproject deformity fortheperception
ofbeings whose consciousness isnottobetreated asconsciousness.
1015
Thin* single andhot* liketheburning pressure ofawire within her,
likeaneedle selecting hercourse, washeronlyconcern: thethought
ofhissafety. The restwasablurofshapeless dissolution, half-acid,
half-fog.
Butthis—shethought withashudder—wasthestate inwhich they
lived, allthose peoplewhom shehadnever understood, thiswasthe
state they desired, thisrubber reality, thistaskofpretending, dis-
torting, deceiving, withthecredulous stare ofsome Mr.Thompson’s
panic-bleary eyes asone’s onlypurpose andreward. Those who de-
sired thisstate—shewondered-— didtheywant tolive?
“The biggest stakes intheworld. MissTaggart?” Mr.Thompson
wasasking heranxiously. “What isit?What doeshewant?”
“Reality. This earth.”
“Idon’tknow quite whatyoumean, but ...lA>ok. Miss Taggart,
ifyouthink youcanunderstand him,would you .. .would you try
tospeak tohimoncemore?”
She feltasifsheheard herown voice, many light-years away,
crying thatshewould giveher lifetoseehim butinthisroom, she
heard thevoice otameaningless stranger saying coldly, “No, Mr.
Thompson, Iwouldn’t. 1hope I’llnever have toseehimagain.”
“Iknow thatyoucan’t stand him,and 1can't say Iblame you,
butcouldn’t you just tryto—”
“Itried toreason withhim. thenight Ifound him. Iheard nothing
but insults inreturn. Ithink heresents memore than he'd resent
anyone else.Hewon’t forgive methefactthat itwas 1whotrapped
him. I’dbethe lastperson towhom hewould surrender.”
“Yeah . ..yeah, that’s true...Doyou think hewillever
surrender?”
Theneedle within herwavered foramoment, burning itsoscillat-
ingwaybetween twocourses: should shesaythathewould not,and
seethem killhim?—should shesaythathewould, andseethem
holdonto theirpower tilltheydestroyed theworld?
“He will,” shesaid firmly. “He’ll give in, ityou treathim right.
He'stooambitious torefuse power. Don’t lethimescape, butdon't
threaten him-- orharm him. Fear won't work. He’s impervious to
fear.”
“Butwhat if... 1mean, with thewaythings arecollapsing . . .
what ifheholds outtoolong?”
“He won’t. He’s toopractical forthat.Bytheway, areyou letting
himhearanynews about thestate ofthecountry?”
“Why . ..no.”
“Iwould suggest thatyou lethimhave copies ofyour confidential
reports. He’ll seethat itwon’t belong now?.”
“That’s agood idea!Averygood ideal . . .Youknow. Miss
Taggart,” hesaidsuddenly, with thesound i>fsome desperate cling-
inginhisvoice, “Ifeelbetter whenever Italk toyou. It’sbecailse
Itrust you. Idon’t trustanybody around mejButyou— -you’re differ-
ent.You’re solid.”
Shewaslooking unflinchingly straight aihim.“Thank you,Mr.
Thompson,” shesaid.
Ithadbeen easy, shethought—untilshewalked outintothestreet
1016
andnoticed thatunder hercoat, herblouse wassticking damply to
hershoulder blades.
Were sheable tofeel—shethought asshewalked through the
concourse oftheTerminal—shewould know thattheheavy indiffer-
ence shenow feltforherrailroad washatred. Shecould notgetrid
ofthefeeling thatshewasrunning nothing butfreight trains: the
passengers, toher,were notliving orhuman. Itseemed senseless to
waste suchenormous effort onpreventing catastrophes, onpro-
tecting thesafety oftrains carrying nothing butinanimate objects.
Shelooked atthefaces intheTerminal: ifhewere todie,she
thought, tobemurdered bytherulers oltheir system, that these
might continue toeat,sleep andtravel— would shework toprovide
them with trains? Ifshewere toscream fortheir help,would one
ofthem rise tohisdefense? Didtheywanthimtolive,theywho
hadheard him?
Thecheck forfivehundred thousand dollars wasdelivered toher
office, that afternoon; itwasdelivered with abouquet offlowers
fromMr.Thompson. Shelooked atthecheck and let itflutter down
toherdesk: itmeant nothing andmade herfeelnothing, noteven
asuggestion ofguilt. Itwas ascrap ofpaper, ofnogreater signifi-
cance than theonesmtheoffice wastebasket. Whether itcould buy
adiamond necklace orthecitydump orthelastofherfood,made
nodifference. Itwould never bespent. Itwasnotatoken ofvalue
andnothing itpurchased could beofvalue. Butthis— shethought—
thisinanimate indifference was thepermanent state ofthepeople
around her,ofmenwhohadnopurpose andnopassion. Thiswas
thestale ofanon-valuing soul; thosewhochose it—shewondered—
didthevwant tolive?
The lights were outoforder inthehalloftheapartment house,
when shecamehome thatevening, numb withexhaustion— andshe
didnotnotice theenvelope ather feet until sheswitched onthe
lmhl inherfoyer. Itwasablank, sealed envelope thathadbeen

“Have youread theconfidential reports 1sentyou?” moaned Mr,
Thompson, thatevening, facing Galtonce more.Hewasaccompa-
niedbyJames Taggart, whohadvolunteered tomeet theprisoner
forthe firsttime.
Galt satonastraight-backed chair, hislegscrossed, smoking a
cigarette. Heseemed erect andrelaxed, together. They could not
decipher theexpression onhisface, except that itshowed nosign
ofapprehension.
“Ihave,” heanswered.
“There’s notmuch time left,” saidMr.Thompson.
‘There isn’t”
‘'Are yougoing toletsuch things goon?”
“Areyou?"
“How canyoubesosureyou’re right?” criedJames Taggart; his
voice wasnotloud, but ithadtheintensity ofacry.“How canyou
take itupon yourself, ataterrible time like this, tostick toyour
own ideas attheriskotdestroying thewhole world?”
“Whose ideas should Iconsider safer tofollow?”
“How canyoubesureyou’re right?How canyouknow ?Nobody
canbesure ofhisknowledge! Nobody! You’re nobetter than any-
oneelse!”
“Then whydoyouwantme?”
“How canyougamble with other people’s lives?How canyou
permit yourself such aselfish luxury astohold out,when people
needyou°”
“You mean: when theyneedmyideas?”
“Nobody isfully right orwrong! There isn'tanyblack orwhite!
You don’t have amonopoly ontruth!”
There wassomething wrong inTaggart’s manner—thought Mr.
Thompson, frowning—some odd, loopersonal resentment, asifit
•were notapolitical issue thathehadcome here tosolve.
‘ifyouhadanysense ofresponsibility,” Taggart wassaying, “you
wouldn’t dare takesuch achance onnothing butyourownjudgment!
Youwould join usandconsider some ideas other thanyourown
andadmit thatwemight beright, too!Youwould help uswithour
plans! Youwould—”
Taggart wentonspeaking with feverish insistence, butMr.Thomp-
soncould not tellwhether Galtwas listening: Gallhad risen and
waspacing theroom, not inamanner ofrestlessness, but inthe
casual manner ofaman enjoying themotion ofhisownbody. Mr.
Thompson noted thelightness ofthesteps, Jhe straight spine, the
flatstomach, therelaxed shoulders. Galtwalked asifhewereboth
unconscious ofhisbodyandtremendously conscious ofhispride in
it.Mr.Thompson glanced atJames Taggart* atthesloppy posture

watching Galt’s movements withsuchhatred thatMr.Thompson sat
up,fearing itwould become audible intheroom. ButGaltwasnot
looking atTaggart.

ofhuman lives? People areperishing and— Oh,forChrist's sake,"
hesnapped, “stop pacing!"
Galt stopped. “Isthisanorder?"
“No, no!" saidMr.Thompson hastily. “It’snotanorder.Wedon't
want togiveyouorders. ...lake iteasy, Jim."
Galtresumed hispacing. “The world iscollapsing "saidTaggart,
hiseyes following Galt irresistibly. “People areperishing— and it’s
youwhocould savethem! Does itmatter who’s right orwrong? You
should join us,even ifyouthinkwerewrong, youshould sacrifice
yourmind tosavethem!"
“Bywhatmeans will 1then savethem?"
“Who doyouthink youarc?" cried Taggart.
Galt stopped. “You know it."
“You’re anegoist!”
“iam."
“Doyou realize what sortofegoist youare7"
“Do you'V' asked Galt, looking straight athim
Itwastheslowwithdrawal ofTaggart's body intothedepth ofhis
armchair, while hiseyeswere holding Gall’s, thatmade Mr.Thomp-
sonunaccountably afraid ofthenextmoment.
“Say," Mr.'Thompson interrupted inabrightly casual voice, “what
sortofcigarette areyousmoking?"
Gait turned tohimandsmiled Idon’t know."
“Where didyougetit?"
“One ofyourguards brought meapackage ofthem.Hesaidsome
manasked him togive ittomeasapresent.. .Don’t worry," he
added, “your boyshave put itthrough every kindoflest.There were
nohidden messages. Itwas just apresent from ananonymous
admirer."
The cigarette between Gait sfingers bore thesignofthedollar.
James Taggart wasnogood atthejobofpersuasion, Mr.Thomp-
sonconcluded. ButChick Morrison, whom hebrought thenext day,
didnobetter.
“1. ..I’lljustthrow myself onyour mercy. Mr.Gall." saidChick
Morrison withafrantic smile. “You’re right. Illconcede thatyou're
right—and all1canappeal toisyour pity.Deepdown inmyheart,
Ican’t believe thatyou’re atotal egoist who feelsnopity forthe
people." Hepointed toapileofpapers hehadspread onatable.
“Here’s apleasigned bytenthousand schoolchildren, begging you
tojoinusandsavethem. Here’s apleafrom ahome forthecrippled.
Here’s apetition sentbytheministers oftwohundred different
faiths. Here’s anappeal from themothers ofthecountry. Read
them."
“Isthisanorder?"
“No!" cried Mr.Thompson. “It’snotanorder!"
Galtremained motionless, notextending hishand forthepapers.
“These arejustplain, ordinary people, MrGalt," saidChick Mor-
rison inatoneintended toproject their abject humility. “They can’t
tellyouwhat todo.They wouldn’t know. They're merely begging
you.Theymaybeweak, helpless, blind, ignorant. Butyou,whoare
1019
sointelligent andstrong, can’tyoutake pityonthem? Can’t you
helpthem?”
“Bydropping myintelligence andfollowing their blindness?”
“They maybewrong, butthey don’tknow anybetter!”
“But I,who do,should obeythem?”
“Ican’t argue, Mr.Oalt. I’mjustbegging foryour pity.They’re
suffering. Pmbegging you topitythosewho suffer, i’m .. .Mr.
Gait,” heasked, noticing thatGaltwaslooking offatthedistance
beyond thewindow and that hiseyeswere suddenly implacable,
“what’s thematter? What areyouthinking of?”
“Hank Rearden.”
“Uh .. .why?”
“Did they feelanypity forHank Rearden?”
“Oh, butthat’s different! He—”
“Shut up," saidGalt evenly.
“1only—”
“Shut up!”snapped Mr.Thompson. “Don’t mind him,Mr.Galt.
Hehasn’t slept fortwo nights. He’s scared outofhiswits.”
Dr.Floyd Ferris, next day,didnotseem tobescared—but itwas
worse, thought Mr.Thompson. Heobserved thatGaltremained si-
lentandwould notanswer Ferris atall.
“It's thequestion ofmoral responsibility thatyoumight nothave
studied sufficiently, Mr.Galt,” Dr.Ferris wasdrawling intoo airy,
tooforced atone ofcasual informality. “You seem tohave talked
ontheradio about nothing butsinsofcommission. Butthere are
also thesinsofomission toconsider. To failtosave alife isas
immoral astomurder. Theconsequences arethesame—andsince
wejustjudge actions bytheirconsequences, themoral responsibility
isthesame. . . .Forinstance, inview ofthedesperate shortage of
food, ithasbeen suggested that itmight become necessary toissue
adirective ordering thatevery thirdoneofallchildren under the

would you?Youcanprevent it.Oneword fromyouwould prevent
it.Ifyourefuse and allthose people areexecuted— itwillbeyour
faultandyourmoral responsibility!”
“You’re crazy!” screamed Mr.Thompson, recovering from shock
andleaping tohisfeet.“Nobody’s ever suggested anysuch thing!
Nobody’s ever considered it!Please, Mr.Galt! Don’t believe him!
Hedoesn’t mean it!”
“Oh yes,hedoes,” said Galt. “Tell thebastard tolook atme,
thenlook inthemirror, thenaskhimself whether Iwould ever think
thatmymoral stature isatthemercy ofhtiactions.”
“Get outofhere!” cried Mr.Thompson, ranking Ferris tohisfeet.
“Get out!Don’t letmehearanother squeajt outofyou!”Heflung
thedooropen andpushed Ferris atthepartied faceofaguard
outside.

Turning toGalt, hespread hisarmsand Jetthem drop with a
gesture ofdrained helplessness. Galt’s faceWasexpressionless.
“Look,” saidMr.Thompson pleadingly, “Isn’t thereanybody who
cantalktoyou?”
1020
"There’s nothing totalkabout.”
‘Wevegot to.We’ve gottoconvince you. Isthere anyone you’dwant totalkto?”
“No.”
“1thought maybe . ..it’sbecause shetalks— used totalk— like
you, attimes ...maybe ifIsentMissDagny Taggart totellyou—”
“That one? Sure, sheused totalk likeme.She’smyonly failure.
Ithought shewasthekindwhobelonged onmyside.Butshedou-
ble-crossed me,tokeep her railroad. She’d sellhersoul forher
railroad. Send her in, ifyouwantmetoslapherface.”
“No, no,no!Youdon’t have toseeher, ifthat’showyou feel. I
don't want towaste more timeonpeople whorubyouthewrong
way. ...Only ...only ifit’snotMiss Taggart, Idon’tknowwhom
topick.... If... if1could findsomebody you’d bewilling to
consider or . ..”
“I’ve changed mymind,” said Galt. “There tssomebody I’dlike
tospeak to.”
“Who?” cried Mr.Thompson eagerly.
“Dr.Robert Stadler”
Mr.Thompson emitted along whistle andshook hishead appre-
hensively. “That one isnofriend ofyours,” hesaid inatone of
honest warning.
“He’s theone 1want tosee.”
“Okay, ifyouwish. Ifyousayso.Anything youwish. I’llhave
himheretomorrow morning.”
That evening, dining withWesley Mouch inhisown suite, Mr.
Thompson glared angrily ataglass oftomato juice placed before
him.“What? Nograpefruit juice?” hesnapped: hisdoctor hadpre-
scribed grapefruit juice asprotection against anepidemic ofcolds.
“No grapefruit juice,” said thewaiter, with anodd kind of
emphasis.
“Fact is,”saidMouch bleakly, “that agang ofraiders attacked a
tiain attheTaggart Bridge ontheMississippi. They blewupthe
trackanddamaged thebridge. Nothing serious. It’sbeing repaired—
but ailtraffic isheld upand thetrains from Arizona can't get
through.”
“[hat's ridiculous! Aren’t there anyother—?” Mr.Thompson
stopped; heknew thatthere were noother railroad bridges across
theMississippi. After amoment, hespoke upinastaccato voice.
“Order army detachments toguard thebridge. DayaDd night. Tell
them topick their bestmen for it.Ifanything happened tothat
bridge—”
Hedidnotfinish; hesalhunched, staring down atthecostly china
plates andthedelicate horsdoeuvres before him.Theabsence of
soprosaic acommodity asgrapefruit juicehadsuddenly made real
tohim, forthe firsttime, what itwasthatwould happen tothecity
ofNewYork ifanything happened totheTaggart Bridge.
“Dagny,” saidEddie Willers, thatevening, “thebridge isnotthe
onlyproblem.” Hesnapped onherdesklamp which,mforced con-
centration ofherwork, shehadneglected toturnonattheapproach
ofdusk.“No transcontinental trains canleave SanFrancisco. One
1021
ofthefighting factions outthere—Idon’tknow whichone— has
seized oUrterminal andimposed a‘departure tax*ontrains. Meaning
that they’re holding trains forransom. Ourterminal manager has
quit.Nobody knows what todothere now.”
”1can’t leaveNewYork,” sheanswered stonily.
“Iknow,” hesaid softly. “Tbat*s why it’s Iwho'll gothere to
straighten things out.Atleast, tofindaman toputincharge.”
“No! 1don’t wantyou to.It’stoodangerous. Andwhat for? It
doesn’t matter now. There’s nothing tosave.”
“It's stillTaggart Transcontinental. I’llstand by it.Dagny, wher-
everyougo,you’ll always beable tobuild arailroad. Icouldn’t. I
don’t evenwant tomake anew start. Notanymore. Not afterwhat

“Eddie! Don’t youwant—”Shestopped, knowing that itwasuse-
less.“All right, Eddie. Ifyouwish.”
“I'm flying toCalifornia tonight. I’vearranged forspace onan

When you’re ready, just go.Don’t worry about me.Don’t wait to

Sherose toher feet.They stood facing each other: inthedim
halflight oftheoffice, thepicture ofNathaniel Taggart hungonthe
wallbetween them. They were both seeing theyears since that dis-
tantdaywhen theyhad firstlearned towalkdown thetrack ofa
railroad. Heinclined hisheadandheld itlowered foralongmoment.
Sheextended herhand. “Good-bye, Eddie.”
Heclasped herhand firmly, notlooking down athisfingers; he
waslooking atherface.
Hestarted togo,butstopped, turned toherandasked, hisvoice
low,butsteady, neither aspleanorasdespair, butasalastgesture
ofconscientious clarity toclose along ledger, “Dagny ...didyou
know ..,how Ifeltabout you7”
“Yes,” shesaid softly, realizing inthismoment thatshehadknown
itwordlessly foryears, “Iknew it”
“Good-bye, Dagny.”
The faintrumble ofanunderground trainwent through thewalls
ofthebuilding andswallowed thesound ofthedoor closing alter
him.
Itwassnowing, nextmorning, andmelting drops were likeanicy,
cutting touch onthetemples ofDr.Robert Stadler, ashewalked
down thelong corridor oftheWayne-Falkland Hotel, toward the
door oftheroyal suite.Twohusky menwalked byhissides: they
werefrom thedepartment ofMorale Conditioning, butdidnottrou-
bletohidewhatmethod ofconditioning t|eywould welcome a
chance toemploy.
“Justremember Mr.Thompson’s orders,” jjoneofthem toldhim*
contemptuously. “One wrong squawk outofyou—andyou’ll regret
it,brother.”*
Itwasnotthesnow onhistemples—thought Dr.Stadler—itwas
aburning pressure, ithadbeen there since that scene, last night,
when hehadscreamed toMr.ITiompson thathecould notseeJohn
1022
Gait.Hehadscreamed inblind terror, begging acircle ofimpassive
faces nottomake himdo it,sobbing thathewould doanything but
that.The facesbadnotcondescended toargue oreven tothreaten
him; theyhadmerely given him orders. Hehadspent asleepless
night, telling himself thathewould notobey; buthewaswalking
toward thatdoor, theburning pressure onhistemples andthefaint,
dizzying nausea ofunreality came from thefactthathecould not
recapture thesense ofbeing Dr.Robert Stadler.
Henoticed themetallic gleam ofthebayonets heldbytheguards at
thedoor, andthesound ofakeybeing turned inalock.Hefound
himself walking forward andheard thedoor being locked behind him.
Across thelongroom, hesawJohn Galt sitting onthewindow
sill,atall,slender figure inslacks and shirt, one legslanting down
tothefloor, theother bent, hishands clasping hisknee, hishead of
sun-streaked hair raised against aspread ofgraysky-and suddenly
Dr,Stadler sawthefigure ofayoung boy sitting ontheporch-railing
ofhishome, near thecampus ofthePatrick Henry University, with
thesunonthechestnut hairofahead lifted against aspread of
summer blue,andheheard thepassionate intensity ofhisownvoice
saying twenty-two years ago:“The only sacred value intheworld,
John, isthehuman mind, theinviolate human mind ..—andhe
cried tothatboy’s figure, across theloom andacross theyears:
“1couldn’t help it,John! 1couldn’t help it!”
Hegripped theedge ofatablebetween them, forsupport andas
aprotective barrier, even though thefigure onthewindow sillhad
notmoved.
“Ididn’t bring youtothis!’’ hecried. “1didn’tmean to! 1couldn’t

Dr.Stadler’s gaspwasamuffled scream, asiftheimmobility of

suddenly made himseethe fullmeaning ofhisownwords.
“No!” moaned Dr.Stadler, moving hishe&dfrom side toside, to
escape theunmoving green eyes.“No! . . . -* •No!”

Dr.Stadler banged hisfistsagainst thedopr;when itwasopened,
heranoutoftheroom.
* *
Forthree days,nooneentered Galt’s suite except theguards who
brought hismeals. Early ontheevening ofthefourth day,thedoor
1024
opened toadmit Chick Morrison withtwocompanions. Chick Mor-risonwasdressed indinner clothes, and hissmile wasnervous butashade more confident than usual.One ofhiscompanions wasavalet Theother wasamuscular manwhose faceseemed toclashwith histuxedo: itwasastony facewithsleepy eyelids, pale, dartingeyesandaprizefighter’s broken nose; hisskullwasshaved except
forapatch offaded blond curlsontop;hekept hisrighthandmthepocket ofhistrousers.
“You willplease dress. Mr.Galt,” saidChick Morrison persua-
sively, pointing tothedoor ofthebedroom, where acloset hadbeen
filled withexpensive garments which Galthadnotchosen towear.“You willplease putonyour dinner clothes.” Headded, “This isanorder, Mr.Galt.”
Galtwalked silently intothebedroom. The threemen followed.
Chick Morrison satontheedge ofachair, starting anddiscarding
onecigarette after another. The valet went through toomany too
courteous motions, helping Galt todress, handing him hisshin studs,
holding hiscoat.Themuscular manstoodmacorner, hishand in
hispocket. Noonesaid aword.
“You willplease co-operate, Mr.Galt,” saidChick Morrison, when
Galtwasready, and indicated thedoor with acourtly gesture of
invitation toproceed.
Soswiftly thatnoonecould catch themotion ofhishand, the
muscular manwasholding Galt’s armandpressing aninvisible gun
against hisribs. "‘Don’t make any falsemoves,” hesaid inanexpres-
sionless voice.
”1never do,” said Galt.
Chick Morrison opened thedoor.The valet stayed behind. The
three figures indinner clothes walked silently down thehalltothe
elevator.
They remained silent intheelevator, theclicks oftheflashing
numbers above thedoormarking theirdownward progress.
Theelevator stopped onthemezzanine floor.Twoarmed soldiers
preceded them andtwoothers followed, astheywalked through the
long,dim corridors. The corridors were deserted except forarmed
sentinels posted attheturns Themuscular man’s rightarmwas
linked toGalt’s left;thegunremained invisible toanypossible ob-
server. Galt feltthesmall pressure ofthemuzzle against hisside;
thepressure wasexpertly maintained: nottobefeltasanimpedi-
ment andnottobeforgotten foramoment.
Thecorridor ledtoawide, closed doorway. The soldiers seemed
tomeltaway intotheshadows, when Chick Morrison’s handtouched
thedoorknob* Itwashishand thatopened thedoor, butthesudden
contrast oflightandsound made itseem asifthedoorwere flung
open byanexplosion: thelightcame from three hundred bulbs in
theblazing chandeliers ofthegrand ballroom oftheWayne-Falkland
Hotel; thesound wastheapplause offivehundred people.
Chick Morrison ledtheway tothespeakers’ table raised ona
platform above thetables filling theroom. Thepeople seemed to
know, without announcement, thatofthetwofigures following him,
itwasthe tall,slender manwith thegold-copper hairthattheywere
1025
applauding. Hisfacehad thesame quality asthevoice theyhad
heard ontheradio: calm, confident—andoutofreach.
The seatreserved forGaltwastheplace ofhonor inthecenter
ofthelong table, withMr.Thompson waiting forhim athisright
andthemuscular man slipping skillfully intotheseat athis left,not
relinquishing hisarmorthepressure ofthemuzzle. Thejewels on
thenaked shoulders ofwomen carried theglitter ofthechandeliers
totheshadows ofthetables crowded against thedistant walls; the
severe black-and-white ofthemen’s figures rescued theroom’s style
ofsolemnly regal luxury from thediscordant slashes made bynews
cameras, microphones and adormant array oftelevision equipment.
Thecrowd wason itsfeet, applauding. Mr.Thompson wassmiling
andwatching Galt’s face, with theeager, anxious look ofanadult
waiting forachild's reaction toaspectacularly generous gift.Galt
satfacing theovation, neither ignoring itnorresponding,
“The applause youarehearing,” aradio announcer was yelling
intoamicrophone inacomer oftheroom, “isingreeting toJohn
Galt,whohasjusttaken hisplace atthespeakers' table! Yes,my
friends, John Galt inperson— asthose ofyouwhocanfindatelevi-
sion setwillhave achance toseeforyourself inashort while!'’
1mustremember where 1am—thought Dagny, clenching her fists
under thetablecloth, intheobscurity ofaside table. Itwashard to
maintain asense ofdouble reality inthepresence ofGalt, thirty feet
away from her.She feltthatnodanger orpain could exist inthe
world solong asshecould seehisface—and,simultaneously, anicy
terror, when shelooked atthosewhoheldhim intheirpower, when
sheremembered theblind irrationality oftheevent theywere stag-
ing.Shefought tokeep herfacial muscles rigid, nottobetray herself
byasmile ofhappiness orbyascream ofpanic.
Shewondered how hiseyeshadbeen able tofindher inthat
,crowd. Shehadseen thebriefpause ofhisglance, which nooneelse
could notice; theglance hadbeenmore than akiss, ithadbeen a
handshake ofapproval andsupport.
Hedidnotglance again inherdirection. Shecould notforce
herself tolook away. Itwas startling toseehim inevening clothes
andmore startling still thathewore them sonaturally; hemade
them look likeawork uniform ofhonor; hisfigure suggested the
kind ofbanquet, inthedays ofadistant past,where hewould have
been receiving anindustrial award. Celebrations— -sheremembered
herown words, with astaboflonging—should beonly forthose
whohavesomething tocelebrate.
Sheturned away. Shestruggled nottoloojk athimtoooften, not
toattract theattention ofhercompanions. $hehadbeen placed at
atableprominent enough todisplay hertotNeassembly, butobscure
enough tokeep heroutofthelineofGalt’sl sight, along with those
whohad incurred Galt’s disfavor; with dr. Ferris andEugene
Lawson.
Herbrother, Jim,shenoted, hadbeen placed closer totheplat-
form; shecould see hissullen faceamong thenervous figures of
Tinky Holloway, Fred Kinnan, Dr.Simon Pritchett. The tortured
faces strung outabove thespeakers’ tablewere notsucceeding in
1026
thcif efforts tohide thattheylooked likemenenduring anordeal;
thecalm ofGalt’s faceseemed radiant among them; shewonderedwhowasprisoner hereandwhowasmaster. Her glance moved
slowly down theline-up ofhistable: Mr.Thompson, Wesley Mouch,
Chick Morrison, some generals, somemembers oftheLegislature
and, preposterously, Mr.Mowen, chosen asabribe toGall, asa
symbol ofbigbusiness. Sheglanced about theroom, looking forthe
faceofDr.Stadler; hewasnotpresent.
Thevoices filling theroom were likeafever chart, shethought;
theykept darting toohighandcollapsing intopatches ofsilence; the
occasional spurts ofsomeone's laughter broke off,incomplcted, and
attracted theshuddering turnoftheheads attheneighboring tables.
Ibe faces weredrawn and twisted bythemost obvious and least
dignified form oftension: byforced smiles. These people— she
thought—knew, notbymeans oftheir reason, butbymeans oftheir
panic, that thisbanquet wastheultimate climax andthenaked es-
sence oftheir world. ITieyknew that neither theirGod northeir
gunscouldmake thiscelebration mean what theywere struggling to
pretend itmeant.
Shecould notswallow thefood thatwasplaced before her;her
throat seemed closed byarigid convulsion. Shenoticed that the
others athertabic were alsomerely pretending tocat.Dr.Ferris
wastheonlyonewhose appetite seemed unaffected
When shesawaslush oficecream inacrystal bowl before her,
shenoticed thesudden silence oftheroom andheard thescreeching
ofthetelevision machinery being dragged forward foraction.Now—
shethought, with asinking sense ofexpectation, andknew thatthe
same question mark wasonevery mind intheroom. They were all
staring atGalt. Hisfacedidnotmove orchange.
Noonehadtocallforsilence, when Mr,Thompson waved toan
announcer, theroom didnotseem tobreathe.
"‘Fellow citizens,” theannouncer cried into amicrophone, “ofthis
country andofanyother that's able lolisten—from thegrand ball
room oftheWayne-Falkland Hotel inNewYork City,wcarebring-
ingyoutheinauguration oftheJohn Gall Plan!"
Arectangle oftensely bluish lightappeared onthewallbehind
thespeakers’ table—atelevision screen toproject fortheguests the
images which thecountry wasnow tosee.
“The John Gall Plan forPeace, Prosperity andProfit!” cried the
announcer, while ashivering picture oftheballroom sprang intoview
onthescreen. “Thedawn ofanew age!Theproduct ofaharmoni-
ouscollaboration between thehumanitarian spirit ofourleaders and
thescientific genius ofJohn Galt! Ifyour faith inthefuture hasbeen
undermined byvicious rumors, youmaynow seeforyourself our
happily united family ofleadership!. ..Ladies andgentlemen” as
thetelevision camera swooped down tothespeakers’ table, andthe
stupefied faceofMr.Mowen filled thescreen—“Mr.Horace Bussby
Mowen, theAmerican Industrialist!” Thecamera moved toanaged
collection offacial muscles shaped inimitation ofasmile. “General
oftheArmy Whittington S.Iborpe!” Thecamera, likeaneyeata
police line-up, moved from facetoscarred face—scarred bytherav-
1027
agesoffear,ofevasion, ofdespair, ofuncertainty, ofself-loathing,
ofguilt, “Majority Leader oftheNational Legislature, Mr.Lucian
Phelps! .. ,Mr.Wesley Mouch! ...Mr.Thompson!” Thecamera
paused onMr.Thompson: hegave abiggrin tothenation, then
turned andlooked off-screen, tohisleft,withanairoftriumphant
expectancy. “Ladies andgentlemen,” theannouncer saidsolemnly,
“John Gait!”
Good God!—thought Dagny—what arethey doing? From the
screen, theface ofJohn Galtwaslooking atthenation, theface
without painorfearorguilt, implacable byvirtue ofserenity, invul-
nerable byvirtue ofself-esteem. This face—shethought—among
those others? Whatever itisthatthey’re planning, shethought, it’s
undone—nothing more canorhastobesaid—
there’s theproduct of
onecodeandoftheother, there’s thechoice, andwhoever ishuman
willknow it.
“Mr. Galt’s personal secretary.” said theannouncer, while the
camera blurred hastily pastthenext faceandwent on.“Mr. Clarence
‘Chick’ Morrison .. .Admiral Homer Dawley . ..Mr.—”
Shelooked atthefaces around her,wondering: Didtheyseethe
contrast? Didtheyknow it?Didthey seehim?Didtheywanthim
tobereal?
“This banquet,” saidChick Morrison, whohadtaken over asmas-

Thecamera wasroving over theballroom, Hashing tothescreen
andtothecountry thefaces oftheprominent guests, thefaces of
thetensely watchful leaders and—once in&while—thefaceofJohn
Galt.Helooked asifhisperceptive eye^were studying themen
outside thisroom, themenwhowere seeir|g himacross thecountry;
onecould not tellwhether hewaslistening noreaction altered the
composure ofhisface.*
“Iamproud topaytribute tonight,” saidHhe leader oftheLegisla-
ture, thenextspeaker, “tothegreatest economic organizer theworld
haseverdiscovered, themost gifted administrator, themost brilliant
planner—John Galt, themanwho willsave us! Iamhere tothank
him inthename ofthepeople!”
1028
This— “thought Dagny, with asickened amusement —was
facie ofthesincerity ofthedishonest. Themost fraudulent partof
thefraud wasthattheymeant it.They were offering Galt thebest
that their view ofexistence could offer, theywere trying totempt
himwith thatwhich wastheirdream oflife’s highest fulfillment: this
spread ofmindless adulation, theunreality ofthisenormous pre-
tense-approval without standards, tribute without content, honor
without causes, admiration without reasons, lovewithout acode of
values.
“Wehave discarded allourpetty differences,” Wesley Mouch was
nowsaying intothemicrophone, “allpartisan opinions, allpersonal
interests and selfish views— inorder toserve under theselfless lead-
ership ofJohn Galt!”
Why aretheylistening?— thought Dagny. Don’t theyseethehall-
mark ofdeath inthose faces, andthehallmark oflifeinhis?Which state
dotheywish tochoose? Which staledotheyseek formankind? ...
Shelooked atthefaces intheballroom. They were nervously blank;
theyshowed nothing butthesagging weight oflethargy andthe
staleness otachronic fear.They were looking atGaltand atMouch,
asilunahle toperceive anydifference between them ortofeelcon-
cern ifadifference existed, their empty, uncritical, unvaluing stare
declaring: "Who am 1toknow?” Sheshuddered, remembering his
sentence: “Themanwho declares, ‘Whoam Itoknow?' isdeclaring,
‘Whoam 1tolive?’”Didthey care tolive?— shethought. They did
notseem tocareeven fortheeffort ofraising thatquestion. .. .She
sawafewfaceswhoseemed tocare. Theywere looking atGalt with
adesperate plea, with awistfully tragic admiration—andwithhands
lying limply onthetables before them. These were themenwho
sawwhat hewas,who lived infrustrated longing forhisworld— but
tomorrow, iftheysawhimbeing muidered before them, theirhands
would hang aslimply and their eyeswould lookaway, saying, “Who
am Itoact?”
“Unity ofaction andpurpose,” saidMouch, “will bring ustoa
happier world. ..."
Mr,'Thompson leaned toward Gallandwhispered withanamiable
smite, “You’ll have tosayalewwords tothecountry, later on,after
me.No,no,notalongspeech, justasentence ortwo,nomore. Just
‘hello, folks’ orsomething like that, sothey’ll recognize your voice,”
The faintly stressed pressure ofthe“secretary's” muzzle against
Galt’s sideadded asilent paragraph. Galt didnotanswer.
“The John Galt Plan.” Wesley Mouch wassaying, “will reconcile
allconflicts. Itwillprotect theproperty oftherichandgiveagreater
share tothepoor. Itwillcutdown theburden ofyour taxesandprovide
youwithmore government benefits. Itwilllower prices and raise
wages. Itwillgivemore freedom totheindividual andstrengthen
thebonds ofcollective obligations. Itwillcombine theefficiency ot
freeenterprise with thegenerosity ofaplanned economy.
Dagny observed some faces—ittook heraneffort fully tobelieve
il—whowere looking atGalt with hatred. Jimwasoneofthem, she
noted.When theimage ofMouch held thescreen, these faces were
1029
relaxed inbored contentment, which wasnotpleasure, butthecomfort
oflicense, ofknowing thatnothing wasdemanded ofthemandnothing
waslumorcertain. When thecamera flashed theimage ofGalt, their
lipsgrew tightandtheir features weresharpened byatookofpeculiar
caution. She feltwithsudden certainty thatthey feared theprecision
ofhisface, theunyielding clarity ofhisfeatures, thelookofbeing an
entity, alookofasserting existence. They hatehimforbeing himself—
shethought, feeling atouch ofcold horror, asthenature oftheir souls
became real toher— they hatehim forhiscapacity tolive.Dothey
want tolive?—shethought inself-mockery, lbrough thestunned numb-
ness ofhermind, sheremembered thesound ofhissentence: “The
desire nottobeanything, isthedesire nottobe.”
ItwasnowMr.Thompson whowasyelling intothemicrophone
inhisbriskest and folksiest manner: “And 1saytoyou: kickthem
intheteeth, allthose doubters who’re spreading disunity and fear!
They toldyouthatJohn Galtwould never join us,didn’t they? Well,

saidsolemnly, “John Galt—tothecollective family ofmankind!”
Thecamera moved toGalt.Heremained stillforamoment. Then,
with soswiftandexpert amovement that hissecretary’s handwas
unable tomatch it,herose tohisfeet, leaning sidewise, leaving the
pointed gunmomentarily exposed tothesight oftheworld—then,
standing straight, facing thecameras, looking atallhisinvisible view-
ers,hesaid:
“Get thehelloutofmyway!”
Chapter IXTHEGENERATOR
“Get thehelloutofmyway!”
Dr.Robert Stadler heard itontheradio fnhiscar.Hedidnot
know whether thenextsound, part-gasp, part-scream, part-laughter,
started rising fromhimorfrom theradio—butheheard thedick
that cutthem both off.The radio went dead.Nofurther sounds
came from theWayne-Falkland Hotel.
1030
Hejerked hishand from knob toknob under thelighted dial.
Nothing came through, noexplanations, nopleas oftechnical trou-
ble,nosilence-hiding music. Allstations were offthe air.Heshuddered, hegripped thewheel, leaning forward across it,
like ajockey attheclose ofarace,and hisfootpressed down on
theaccelerator. The small stretch ofhighway before himbounced
with theleaping ofhisheadlights. There wasnothing beyond the
lighted strip buttheemptiness oftheprairies ofIowa.
Hedidnotknowwhyhehadbeen listening tothebroadcast: he
didnotknow whatmade himtremble now.Hechuckled abruptly—
itsounded likeamalevolent growl—either attheradio, oratthose
inthecity,oratthesky.
Hewaswatching therare posts ofhighway numbers. Hedidnot
need toconsult amap: forfour days, thatmaphadbeen printed on
hisbrain, likeanetoflines traced inacid.They could nottake it
away from him, hethought, they could notstop him.He feltasif
hewere being pursued; butthere wasnothing formiles behind him,
except thetworedlights ontherearofhiscar—liketwosmall signals
ofdanger, fleeing through thedarkness oftheIowa plains.
Themotive directing hishands andfeetwasfourdaysbehind him.
Itwasthelaceofthemanonthewindow sill,andthefaces hehad
confronted when hehadescaped from thatloom.Hehadcried to
them thathecould notdealwith Galtandneither could they, that
Gallwould destroy them all,unless theydestroyed him tirst.“Don’t
getsmart. Professor.” Mr.Thompson hadanswered coldly ‘You've
done anawful lotofyelling about hating hisguts, butwhen itcomes
toaction, youhaven’t helped usatall. Idon’tknow which side
you're on. Ifhedoesn't give intouspeaceably, wemight have to
resort topressure— -such ashostages whom hewouldn’t want tosee
hurt—andyou're firstonthe list,Professor.”l7?”hehadscreamed,
shaking with terror andwith bitterly desperate laughter. “I?Buthe
damns memore thananyone onearth!” “How do 1know?” Mr.
Thompson hadanswered. “Iheard thatyouused tobehisteacher.
And, don’t forget, you’re theonlyoneheasked for.”
Hismind liquid with terror, hehad feltas ifhewere about tobe
crushed between twowalls advancing upon him: hehadnochance,
ifGalt refused tosurrender -and lesschance, ifGalt joined these
men. Itwasthen that adistant shape hadcome swimming forward
inhismind: theimage ofamushroom-domed structure inthemiddle
ofanIowa plain.
Allimages hadbegun tofuse inhismind thereafter. ProjectX—
hehadthought, notknowing whether itwasthevision ofthat struc-
tureorofafeudal castle commanding thecountryside, thatgavehim
thesense ofanageandaworld towhich hebelonged ...Pm
Robert Stadler—hehadthought—it'smyproperty, itcame frommy
discoveries, they said itwas 1whoinvented it. .. .Pllshow them!—
hehadthought, notknowing whether hemeant themanonthe
window sillortheothers orthewhole ofmankind. ...Histhoughts
hadbecome likechips floating inaliquid, without connections: To
seize control ...VIIshow them! ...Toseize control, torule ..,
There isnootherway toliveonearth. . ..
1031
These hadbeen theonlywords thatnamed theplan inhismind.
Hehad feltthat therestwasclear tohim—clear intheform ofa
savage emotion crying defiantly thathedidnothave tomake itclear.
Hewould seize control ofProjectXandhewould ruleapartofthe
country ashisprivate feudal domain. Themeans? Hisemotion had
answered: Somehow. Themotive? Hismindhadrepeated insistently
that hismotive wasterror ofMr.Thompson’s gang, thathewasnot
safeamong them anylonger, that hisplanwasapractical necessity.
Inthedepth ofhisliquid brain, hisemotion hadheldanother kind
ofterror, drowned along with theconnections between hisbroken
chips ofwords.
These chips hadbeen theonlycompass directing hiscourse
through fourdaysandnights—while hedrove down deserted high-
ways, across acountry collapsing intochaos, while hedeveloped a
monomaniac’s cunning forobtaining illegal purebrses ofgas,while
hesnatched random hours ofrestless sleep, inobscure motels, under
assumed names. . ..I’mRobert Stadler—hehadthought, hismind
repeating itasaformula ofomnipotence. ...Toseize control—he
hadthought, speeding against the futile traffic lights ofhalf-aban-
doned towns—speeding onthevibrating steel oftheTaggart Bridge
across theMississippi—speeding past theoccasional ruins offarms
intheempty stretches ofIowa. . . .I’llshowthem—hehadthought—
letthem pursue, theywon’t stopmethistime. ...Hehadthought
it,even though noonehadpursued him—asnoonewaspursuing
himnow, butthetaillights ofhisown carandthemotive drowned
inhismind.
Helooked athissilent radio andchuckled: thechuckle hadthe
emotional quality ofafistbeing shaken atspace. It’s Iwhoam
practical—liethought—1havenochoice ... Ihavenootherway ...
HIshow allthose insolent gangsters, who forget that IamRobert
Stadler . ..They will allcollapse, but 1won't! .. .I’llsurvive ...
HIwin! . ..I’llshow them!
Thewords were likechunks ofsolidground inhismind, inthe
midst ofafiercely silent swamp; theconnections laysubmerged at
thebottom. Ifconnected, htswords would haveformed thesentence:
I’llshowhimthatthere isnoother waytoliveonearth! ...
The scattered lights inthedistance ahead were thebarracks
erected onthe siteofProject X,nowknown asHarmony City.He
observed, ashecame closer, thatsomething outoftheordinary was
going onatProject X.Thebarbed-wire fence wasbroken, andno
sentinels methim atthegate. Butsome sortofabnormal activity
waschurning inthepatches ofdarkness and intheglare ofsome
wavering spotlights: there werearmored triicks andrunning figures
andshouted orders andthegleam ofbayonets. Noonestopped his
car.Atthecomer ofashanty, hesawthemotionless body ofa
soldier sprawled ontheground. Drunk—|cthought, preferring to
think it,wondering whyhefeltunsure ofk.
Themushroom structure crouched on atknoll before him; there
were lights inthenarrow slitsofitswindows— ^and theshapeless
funnels protruded from under itsdome, aimed atthedarkness of
thecountry.Asoldier barred hisway,when healighted from hiscar
1032
ittheentrance. Thesoldier wasproperly armed, buthatless andhismiform seemed toosloppy. “Where areyougoing, bud?” heasked.“Letmein!”Dr.Stadler ordered contemptuously.
“What’s your business here?”
kTmOr.Robert Stadler.”
ImJoeBlow. Isaid,What syour business? Arcyouoneofthe
leworoneoftheold?”
“Letme in,you idiot! l‘mOr.Robert Stadler!”
Itwasnotthename, butthetone ofthevoice andtheform of
address thatseemed toconvince thesoldier “One ofthenew,” he
saidand,opening thedoor, shouted tosomebody inside, “Hey, Mac,
Lakecare ofCirandpaw here, seewhat hewants!”
Inthebare,dim hallofreinforced concrete, hewasmetbyaman
whomight havebeen anofficer, except that histunicwasopen at
thethroat andacigarette hung insolently inthecorner ofhismouth.
“Who arevow?” hesnapped, hishands jerking tooswiftly tothe
holster onhiship,
‘Tm Dr.Robert Stadler.”
Thename hadnoeffect. “Who gaveyoupermission tocome
here?”
“Ineed nopermission.”
1hisseemed tohave aneffect; themanremoved thecigarette
from hismouth. “Who sent foryou0”heasked, ashade uncertainly.
“Will youplease letmespeak tothecommandant?” Dr.Stadler
demanded impatiently.
“Thecommandant? You’re too late, brother.”
“The chiel engineer, then!”
“The chief-who? Oh, Willie? Willie's. okay, he’sone otus,but
he’soutonancnand justnow.”
There were other figures inthehalllistening withanapprehensive
curiosity. The officer’s handsummoned oneofthem toapproach—
anunshaved civilian with ashabby overcoat thrown over hisshouL
ders.“What doyouwant?” hesnapped atStadler
“Would someone please tellmewhere arethegentlemen ofthe
scientific staff?” Dr.Stadler asked inthecourteously peremptory
lone otanorder.
Thetwomen glanced ateach other, as ifsuch aquestion were
irrelevant inthisplace.“Doyoucome fromWashington?” the civil-
ianasked suspiciously.
“Idonot. 1willhaveyouunderstand thatI’mthrough with that
Washington gang.”
“Oh?” Themanseemed pleased. “Are youaFriend otthePeo-
ple,then?”
“Iwould saythatI’mthebest friend thepeople ever had.Tmthe
manwhogavethem allthis.”Hepointed around him.
“You did?” saidtheman, impressed “Are youoneofthosewho
made adealwith theBoss?”
"Tm theboss here, from now'on.”
Themenlooked ateach other, retreating afewsteps, theofficer
asked, “Didyousaythename wasStadler?”
1033
“Robert Stadler\
And ifyoudon’tknow what thatmeans, you’ll
findout!”
“Will you please follow me, sir?” said the officer, withshaky
politeness.
What happened nextwasnotclear toDr.Stadler, because his
mind refused toadmit thereality ofthethings hewasseeing. There
were shifting figures inhalf-lighted, disordered offices, there were
toomany firearms oneverybody’s hips, there were senseless ques-
tions asked ofhimbyjerky voices thatalternated between imperti-
nence and fear.Hedidnotknow whether anyofthem tried togive
himanexplanation; hewould not listen; hecould notpermit thisto
betrue.Hekept stating inthetone ofafeudal sovereign, ‘Vm the
boss here, fromnowon... Igive theorders ... 1came totake
over ... Iown thisplace. ... IamDr.Robert Stadler —and ityou
don’tknow thatname inthisplace, youhavenobusiness being here,
you infernal idiots! You'll blow yourselves topieces, itthat's the
stateofyourknowledge! Have youhadahigh-school course inphys-
ics?You don’t look tomeas ifyou’ve everbeen allowed inside a
high school, anyofyou!What areyoudoing here?Who arcyou?”
Ittookhimalongtime tograsp—when hismind could notblock
itanylonger—thatsomebody hadbeaten himtohisplan- somebody-
hadheld thesame view' ofexistence ashisown antihad setoutto
achieve thesame future. Hegrasped that these men,who called
themselves theFriends ofthePeople, hadseized possession ofProj-
ectX,tonight, afewhours ago,intending toestablish areign ofthen
own.Helaughed intheir faces, with bitterly incredulous contempt
‘’You don’tnowwhat you’re doing, youmiserable juvenile delin-
quents! Doyouthink thatyou—
you!—canhandle ahigh-precision
instrument ofscience? Who isyour leader? Idemand toseeyour
leader!”
Itwas histone ofoverbearing authority, hiscontempt and their
ownpanic—theblind panic ofmen ofunbridled violence, whohave
nostandards ofsafety ordanger—thatmade themwaver andwondei
whether hewas,perhaps, some secret top-level member oftheir lead-
ership; theywere equally ready todefy orobey anyauthority. After
being shunted from one jittery commander toanother, hefound
himself atlastbeing leddown ironstairways anddown long, echoing,
underground corridors ofreinforced concrete toanaudience with
“The Boss” inperson.
TheBoss hadtaken refuge intheunderground control room.
Among thecomplex spirals ofthedelicate scientific machinery that
produced thesound ray,against thewallpanel ofglittering levers,
dialsandgauges, known astheXylophone* Robert Stadler faced the
new ruler ofProject X.ItwasCuffy Meig^,
Hewore atight, semi-military tunic andjleather leggings; theflesh
ofhisneck bulged over theedge ofhiscellar; hisblack curls were
matted with sweat. Hewaspacing restlesfcly, unsteadily infront ot
theXylophone, shouting orders tomenwtyokept rushing inandout*
oftheroom:
“Send couriers toevery county seatwithin ourreach! Tell’em
thattheFriends ofthePeople havewon! Tell’emthey’re notto

People’s Commonwealth isHarmony City, henceforth tobeknown
asMeigsvillc! Tell’emthat I’llexpect livehundred thousand dollars
perevery fivethousand heads ofpopulation, bytomorrow morning—
orelse!”&
Ittooksome timebefore Cufly Meigs’ attention andbleary brown
eyescould bedrawn tolocus ontheperson ofDr.Stadler. “Well,
what isit?What isit?”hesnapped.
“1amDr.Robert Stadler.”
“Huh?— Oh,yeah! Yeah! You’re thebigguyfrom outer spaces,
aren’t you?You’re thefellowwhocatches atoms orsomething. Well’
whatonearth areyoudoing here?”
“U isIwhoshould askyouthat question.''
“Huh? Look, Professor, I’minnomood forjokes.”
“Ihavecome here tolake control.”
“Control? Ofwhat?”
“Of thisequipment. Ofthisplace. Ofthecountryside within its
ladius ofoperation.”
Meigs stared athimblankly foramoment, then asked softly,
“How didyougethere?”
“Bycar”
“Imean,whom didyoubrine withyou?”
“Nobody.”
“What weapons didyoubring?”
“None. Myname issufficient”
“You came here alone, withyourname andyour car?”
“Idid.”
Cuffy Meigs burst outlaughing inhisface.
“Doyouthink,” asked Dr.Stadler. “thatyoucanoperate anin-
stallation olthiskind?”
“Run along. Professor, runalong! Beat it.before 1haveyoushot!
We've gotnouseforintellectuals around here!”
“How much doyouknow about this'*" Dr.Stadler pointed at
theXylophone.
“Who caies? Technicians areadime adozen these days! Beat it!
Thisain’tWashington! I'mthrough with those impractical dreamers
inWashington! They won't getanywhere, bargaining with thatradio
ghost andmaking speeches! Action— that’s what’s needed! Direct
action! Beat it.Doc!Your day isover!” Hewasweaving unsteadily
backand forth, catching atalever oftheXylophone once inawhile.
Di.Stadler realized thatMeigs wasdrunk.
“Don’t touch those levers, you fool!”
Meigs jerked hishand back involuntarily, thenwaved itdefiantly
atthepanel *TUtouch anything 1please! Don’t vou tellmewhat

“Getaway from that panel! Getoutofhere! This ismine!Do
youunderstand? It’smyproperty!”
“Property? Huh!” Meigs gave abrief bark thatwasachuckle.
”1invented it! 1created it! Imade itpossible!”
“You did? Well, many thanks. Doc.Many thanks, butwedon’t

1035
‘‘Have youanyideawhat Ihad toknow inorder tomake it

Meigs shrugged. “Maybe not.”
“Then howdareyouthink thatyoucanown it?How dareyou

Meigs patted hisholster. “This

“Don’t you talk tomelike that,youoldfool!Who areyou to

“You’re ascared thugwayoutofhisdepth!”
“Oh, Iam,am1?I’mtheBoss! I’mtheBossandI’mnotgoing
tobestopped byanoldscarecrow likeyou!Getoutofhere!”
They stood staring ateach other foramoment, bythepanel of
theXylophone, bothcornered byterror. Theunadmitted rootofDr.
Stadler’s terror was hisfrantic struggle nottoacknowledge thathe
waslooking athisfinalproduct, that thiswas hisspiritual son.Cutty
Meigs’ terror hadwider roots, itembraced allofexistence; hehad
lived inchronic terror allhis life,butnowhewasstruggling notto
acknowledge what itwasthathehaddreaded: inthemoment ofhis
triumph, when heexpected tobesafe, that mysterious, occult
breed—theintellectual— wasrefusing tofearhimanddefying his
power.
“Get outofhere'” snarled Cutty Meigs. “I'll callmymen! I'll

“Get outofhere,youlousy, brainless, swaggering moron!” snarled
Dr.Stadler. “Doyouthink I'll letyoucash inonmy life?Doyou

Hechuckled andreached foralever.
“Hey. Cut'fy, take iteasy!” yelled some figuic intheback ofthe
room, darting forward.
“Stand back!” roared Cully Meigs “Stand back, allofyou!
Scared, amI?I’llshow youwho’s boss!”
Dr,Stadler leaped tostophim—butMeigs shoved himaside with
onearm,gave agulp oflaughter atthesight ofStadler falling to
thefloor, and,with theother arm,yanked alever oftheXylophone.
Thecrash ofsound —the screeching crash ofripped metal andof
pressures colliding onconflicting circuits, th£sound ofamonster
turning upon itself—washeard only inside thjestructure. Nosound
washeard outside. Outside, thestructure merely rose intothe air,
suddenly and silently, cracked open into ajfew large pieces, shot
some hissing streaks ofblue light totheskyandcamedown asa
pileofrubble. Within the circle ofaradios ofahundred miles,
enclosing parts offour states, telegraph potes felllikematchsticks,
farmhouses collapsed into chips, city buildings wentdown as if
slashed andminced byasingle second’s blow, withnotime fora

circle speriphery, halfway across theMississippi, theengine andthefirst
sixcarsofapassenger train flew asashower ofmetal intothewater
oftheriver, along with thewestern spans oftheTaggart Bridge cut

Onthe siteofwhat hadonce been Project X.nothing remained
aliveamong theruins—except, forsome endless minutes longer, a
huddle oftorn flesh andscreaming pain thathadonce been a
great mind.

There wasasense ofweightless freedom- thought Dagny -inthe
feeling thatatelephone boolh washeronly immediate, absolute
goal, withnoconcern loranyotthegoals ofthepassers-by inthe
streets around her. Itdidnotmake hertedestranged from thecity:
itmade her feel, forthe firsttime, thatsheowned thecityandthat
sheloved it,thatshehadnever loved itbefore asshedidinthis
moment, with sopersonal, solemn andconfident asense ofposses-
sion,The night was stilland clear; shelooked atthesky; asher
feeling wasmore solemn than joyous, butheld thesense ofafuture
joy—sotheairwasmore windless thanwarm, butheld thehintof
adistant spring
Getthehelloutofmyway—shethought, notwithresentment, but
almost withamusement, withasense ofdetachment anddeliverance,
addressing ittothepassers-by, tothe traffic when itimpeded her
hurried progress, and toanyfearshehadknown inthepast. Itwas
lessthananhour agothatshehadheard him utter thatsentence,
and hisvoice stillseemed toring intheairofthestreets, merging
intoadistant hintoflaughter
Shehadlaughed exultantly, intheballroom oftheWaync-Falkland,
when shehadheard himsay it;shehadlaughed, herhand pressed
tohermouth, sothatthelaughter wasonly inhereyes—and inhis,
when hehadlooked straight atherandshehadknown thatheheard

theheads ofthegasping, screaming crowd—above thecrash ofthe
microphones being shattered, though allstations hadbeen instantly
cutoff—above thebursts ofbreaking glassonfalling tables, assome
people were stampeding tothedoors.
Then shehadheard Mr.Thompson cry,waving hisarm atGalt,
“Take himback tohisroom, butguard himwithyour lives!”-- and
thecrowd hadparted asthreemen ledhim out.Mr.Thompson
seemed Cocollapse foramoment, dropping hisforehead onhisarm,

tofollow andrushed out,through aprivate side exit.Noonead-
dressed orinstructed theguests: some were running blindly toes-
cape, others sat still,notdaring tomove. Theballroom was likea
shipwithout acaptain. Shecutthrough thecrowd andfollowed the
clique. Noone tried tostop her.
Shefound them huddled inasmall private study; Mr.Thompson
wasslumped inanarmchair, clutching hishead with both hands,
Wesley Mouch wasmoaning, Eugene Lawson wassobbing withthe
sound ofanasty child’s rage, Jimwaswatching theothers withan
1037
oddly expectant intensity. “Itoldyouso!”Dr.Ferris wasshouting.
“Itoldyou so,didn’t l?That’s where yougetwithyour ‘peaceful

Sheremained standing bythedoor. They seemed tonotice her

Hewaved hisarms insome shapeless gesture offutility orfarewell,

“He hasahide-out allstocked forhimself inTennessee,” said
Tinky Holloway reflectively, asifhe,too,hadtaken asimilar precau-

spread hishands anddidnot finish.
Sheknew what thoughts were filling thepause: sheknew that
nomatter what private escapes thesemenhadonce provided for
themselves, theywerenowgrasping thefactthat allofthem were
trapped.
Sheobserved thatthere wasnoterror intheir faces; shesawhints
ofit,but itlooked likeaperfunctory terror Their expressions ranged
from blank apathy totherelieved look ofcheats whohadbelieved
thatthegame could endnoother wayandweremaking noeffort
tocontest itorregret it—tothepetulant blindness ofLawson, who
refused tobeconscious ofanything—tothepeculiar intensity ofJim,
whose facesuggested asecret MTiile.
“Well? Well?” Dr.Ferris wasasking impatiently, with thecrack-
lingenergy ofamanwho feels athome inaworld ofhysteria. “What
.areyounowgoing todowithhim?Argue? Debate? Make speeches?"
Nooneanswered.
“He .. .has , . .to . . .save . . .us,” saidMouch slowly, as it
straining thelastofhismind intoblankness anddelivering anultima-
tumtoreality. “Hehasto .. .takeover . . .andsave thesystem."
“Why don’t youwrite himalove letter about it?”said F’crris.
“We’ve gotto . ..make him ...takeover . ..We’ve gottoforce
him torule,” saidMouch inthelone ofasleepwalker.
“;Vok\” said Ferris, suddenly dropping hisvoice, “doyouseewhat
avaluable establishment theState Science Institute really is?”
Mouch didnotanswer him,butsheobserved lhatthey allseemed
toknow what hemeant. *
“You objected tothatprivate research prelect ofmine as‘imprac-
tical?”said Ferris softly. “Butwhat did 1t0llyou?”
Mouch didnotanswer; hewascracking hisknuckles.
“This isnotime forsqueamishness,” James Taggart spoke upwith
unexpected vigor, buthisvoice, too,wasod<Jly low.“We don’t have
tobesissies about it.”
“Itseems tome ..saidMouch dully, "that ...that theend

Nooneanswered; theywere acting asiftheywished that their
pauses, nottheir words, would statewhat theywere discussing.
“Itwon’t work,” saidTinky Holloway “Hewon't give in.”
“That’s whatyouthink!” said Ferris, andchuckled. “You haven’t
seenourexperimental model inaction. Lastmonth, wegotthree
confessions inthree unsolved murder cases.”
“If...” started Mr.Thompson, and hisvoice cracked suddenly
intoamoan, “ifhedies,we allperish!”
“Don’t worry.” said Ferris. “He won't. The Ferris Persuader is
safely calculated against that possibility.”
Mr.Thompson didnotanswer.
“It.seems tome .. .thatwehavenoother choice . ..”said
Mouch; itwasalmost awhisper
They remained silent, Mr.Thompson wasstruggling nottosee
thattheywere alllooking athim.Then hecried suddenly, “Oh,do
anything youwant! Icouldn't help it!Doanything youwant!”
Dr.Ferris turned toLawson. “Gene.” hesaid tensely, stillwhisper-
ing.“run totheradio-control office. Order allstations tostand by.

Lawson leaped tohisfeet, with asudden, mirthful grin,andran

“Ifwewere tofly—”saidMouch, andstopped abruptly, asifhe
hadcaught some warning inFerris' face.
Shesaw Ferris' eyesmove toher, asifhehadsuddenly remem-
hered herpresence. Sheheld hisglance, letting himseetheuntrou-
bled indifference ofhers, asifshehadneither cared norunderstood.
Then, asifmerely grasping thesignal ofaprivate discussion, she
turned slowly, with thesuggestion ofashrug, and lefttheroom. She
knew thattheywerenow past thestage ofworrying about her.
Shewalked withthesame unhurried indifference through thehalls
andthrough theexitofthehotel. Butablock away, when shehad
turned acorner, herhead flewupandthefolds ofherevening gown
slammed likeasailagainst herlegswith thesudden violence ofthe
speed ofhersteps.
Andnow, assherushed through thedarkness, thinking only of
finding atelephone booth, she feltanewsensation rising irresistibly
within her,pasttheimmediate tension ofdanger andconcern: itwas
thesense offreedom ofaworld thathadnever hadtoheobstructed.
Shesawthewedge oflightonthesidewalk, thatcame from the
window ofabar.Noonegave herasecond glance, asshecrossed
thehalf-deserted room: thefewcustomers were stillwaiting and
whispering tensely infront ofthecrackling blue void ofanempty
television screen.
Standing inthetightspace ofthetelephone booth, asinthecabin
ofashipabout totake offforadifferent planet, shedialed the
number OR6-5693.
Thevoice thatanswered atoncewasFrancisco’s. “Hello?5’
“Francisco?”
“Hello, Dagny. Iwasexpecting youtocall.”
‘Didyouhear thebroadcast?”
“Idid.”
“They arenowplanning toforce himtogive in.”Shekept her
voice tothetone ofafactual report. “They intend totorture him.
They havesome machine called theFerris Persuader, inanisolated
unitonthegrounds oftheState Science Institute. It’sinNewHamp-
shire.They mentioned flying. They mentioned thattheywould have
himontheradio within three hours.”
“1see.Areyoucalling from apublic phone booth?”
“Yes.”
“You’re still inevening clothes, aren’t you?”
“Yes.”
“Now listen carefully. Gohome, change your clothes, pack afew
things you’ll need, takeyourjewelry andanyvaluables thatyoucan
carry, takesomewarm clothing. Wcwon't lave time todo itlater.
Meetmeinforty minutes, onthenorthwest! corner, twoblocks east
ofthemain entrance oftheTaggart Termir^1”
“Right”
“Solong. Slug.”
“Solong, Frisco.”
Shewas inthebedroom ofherapartment, inlessthan fiveminutes,
tearing offherevening gown. She left itlying inthemiddle ofthe
floor, Tikethediscarded uniform ofanarmy shewasnotserving any
1040
longer. Sheputonadark blue suitand— remembering Galt'swords—
awhite, high-collared sweater. Shepacked asuitcase andabagwith
astrap thatshecould carryswung over hershoulder. Sheputher
jewelry inacorner ofthebag, including thebracelet ofRearden
Metal shehadearned intheoutside world, andthefive-dollar gold
piece shehadearned inthevalley.
Itwaseasy toleave theapartment andtolock thedoor, even
though sheknew shewould probably never open itagain. Itseemed
harder, foramoment, when shecame toheroffice.Noonehadseen
hercome in;theanteroom ofheroffice wasempty; thegreat Taggart
Building seemed unusually quiet. Shestood looking foramoment at
thisroom and atalltheyears ithadcontained. Then shesmiled— no,
itwasnottoohard, shethought; sheopened hersafeandtook the
documents shehadcome here toget. Iherewasnothing elsethat
shewanted totakefrom heroffice—except thepicture ofNathaniel
Taggart andthemap ofTaggart Transcontinental. Shebroke the
twoframes, folded thepicture andthemap,andslipped them into
hersuitcase.
Shewaslocking thesuitcase, when sheheard thesound ofhurrying
steps.Thedoor (lewopen andthechief engineer lushed in;hewas
shaking; hisfacewasdistorted.
“Miss Taggart!” hecried, “Oh, thank God, Miss laggart. you're
here!We’ve been calling lotyou allover!”
.Shedidnotanswer; shelooked athiminquiringly.
“Miss Taggart, haveyouheard*”
“What?”
“Then youhaven’t! OhGod. Miss laggait, it’s . Ican’t believe
it, 1stillcan't believe it,but . ..OhGod, what arewcgoing todo?
The...theTaggart Bridge isgone*”
Shestated athim,unable tomove.
“It’sgone! Blown up!Blown up,apparently, inonesecond! No-
bodyknows forceitain whathappened— but itlooks like . ,they
think thatsomething wentwrong atProjectXand... itlooks like
those sound rays. Miss Taggart! Wccan’t getthrough toanypoint
within aradius ofahundred miles’ It’snotpossible, itcan’t be
possible, but itlooks as ifeverything inthat circle hasbeen wiped
out! . ..Wecan’t getanyanswers! Nobody cangetananswer- -the
newspapers, theradio stations, thepolice! We’re stillchecking, but
thestories that arecoming from therimofthat circlearc—” He
shuddered. “Only onething iscertain: thebridge isgone! MissTag-
gart!Wedon’tknow what todo!”
Sheleaped toherdesk andseized thetelephone receiver. Her
hand stopped inmid-air. Then, slowly, twistedly, with thegreatest
effort everdemanded ofher.shebegan tomove herarmdown to
place thereceiver back. Itseemed toherthat ittook along time,
asifherarmhad tomove against some atmospheric pressure that
nohuman body couldcombat— and inthespan ofthese fewbrief
moments, inthestillness ofablinding pain, sheknew what Francisco
had felt, that night, twelve years ago—andwhat aboyoftwenty-six
had feltwhen hehadlooked athismotor forthelasttime.
1041
“Miss Taggart!” cried thechief engineer, “We don’tknow what
todo!’
The receiver clicked softly back into itscradle. “Idon't, either,”
sheanswered.
Inamoment, sheknew itwasover: Sheheard hervoice telling
theman tocheck further andreport toherlater—andshewaited
forthesound ofhissteps tovanish intheechoing silence ofthehall.
Crossing theconcourse oftheTerminal forthe lasttime, she
glanced atthestatue ofNathaniel Taggart—andremembered a
promise shehadmade. Itwould beonly asymbol now, shethought,
but itwould bethekind offarewell thatNathaniel Taggart deserved.
Shehadnoother writing instrument, soshetook thelipstick from
herbagand, smiling upatthemarble faceofthemanwhowould
have understood, shedrew alarge signofthedollar onthepedestal
under hisfeel.
Shewas first toreach thecorner, twoblocks eastoftheTerminal
entrance. Asshewaited, sheobserved the first trickles ofthepanic
thatwassoon toengult thecity:there were automobiles driving too
fast,some ofthem loaded with household effects, there were too
many police carsspeeding by,andtoomany sirens bursting inthe
distance. Thenews ofthedestruction oftheBridge wasapparently
spreading through the city; theywould know that the citywas
doomed andtheywould start astampede toescape— buttheyhad
noplace togo,and itwasnotherconcern anylonger.
ShesawFrancisco's figure approaching fromsome distance away;
sherecognized theswiftness ofhiswalk, before shecould distinguish
thefaceunder thecappulled lowover hiseyes. Shecaught the
•moment when hesaw her, ashecame closer. Hewaved hisarm,
with asmile ofgreeting. Some conscious stress inthesweep ofhis
armmade itthegesture ofad’Anconia, welcoming thearrival ofa
long-awaited traveler atthegates ofhisowndomain.
When heapproached, shestood solemnly straight and.looking at
hisfaceand atthebuildings ofthegreatest city intheworld, asat
thekind ofwitnesses shewanted, shesaidslowly, hervoice confident
andsteady:
“1swear—bymy lifeandmylovt ofit—that 1willnever live for
thesake ofanother man, noraskanother man toliveformine.”
Heinclined hishead, asifinsignofadmittance. Hissmile was
nowasalute.
Then hetook hersuitcase withonehand, herarmwith theother,
and said,“Come on.”

The unitknown as“Project F”—inhonor ofitsoriginator. Dr.
Ferris—wasasmall structure ofreinforced concrete, lowontheslope
ofthe hillthatsupported theState Science Institute onahigher,
more public level Only thesmall graypatc£ oftheunit’s roofcould
beseenfrom theInstitute’s windows, hidden inajungle ofancient
trees; itlooked nobigger than thecover ofamanhole.
The unitconsisted oftwo stories inth<$shape ofasmall cube
placed asymmetrically ontopofalarger one.The firststoryhadno
windows, onlyadoorstudded with iron spikes; thesecond story had

butonewindow, asifinreluctant concession todaylight likeaface
withasingle eye.ThemenonthestaffoftheInstitute feltnocurios-
ityabout thatstructure andavoided thepaths thatleddown toits
door;nobody hadeversuggested it,buttheyhadtheimpression that
thestructure housed aproject devoted toexperiments withthegerms
ofdeadly diseases.&
Thetwo floors were occupied bylaboratories thatcontained a
greatmany cages withguinea pigs,dogsand rats.Buttheheart andmeaning ofthestructure was aroom initscellar, deep under the
ground; theroom hadbeen incompetently lined with theporous
sheets ofsound-proofing material; thesheets hadbegun tocrack and
thenaked rockofacaveshowed through.
The unitwasalways protected byasquad offour special guards.
Tonight, thesquad hadbeenaugmented tosixteen, summoned for
emergency dutybyalong-distance telephone callfromNew York.
Hieguards, aswell asallother employees of“Project F.”hadbeen
carefully chosen onthebasis otasingle qualification: anunlimited
capacity torobedience.
Thesixteen were stationed torthenight outside thestructure and
inthedeserted laboratories above theground, where theyremained
uncritically onduty, withnocunosily about anything thatmight be
taking place below.
Inthecellar room, undei thegiound. Dr.Ferris, Wesley Mouch
andJames Taggart satinarmchairs lined upagainst one wall.A
machine thatlooked like asmall cabinet otirregular shape st<xidm
acorner across from them. Itsfaceborerows olglass dials, each
dialmarked byasegment ofred,asquaie screen thatlooked like
anamplifier, rows ofnumbers, rows ofwooden knobs and plastic
buttons, asingle lever controlling aswitch atonesideandasingle
icdglass button attheother. The laceofthemachine seemed to
havemore expression than theface otthemechanic incharge ofit;
hewasahusky youngman inasweat- stained shirt withsleeves rolled
above theelbows; hispaleblueeyeswere gla/ed byanenormously
conscientious concentration onhistask;hemoved hislipsonce ina
while, asifreciting amemorised lesson.
Ashort wire ledfrom themachine toanelectric storage battery
behind it.Long coils ofwire, likethetwisted arms ofanoctopus,
stretched forward across thestone flooi, from themachine toa
leather mattress spread under acone ofviolent light.John Galt lay
strapped tothemattress. Hewasnaked; thesmall metal disks of
electrodes attheends ofthewires were attached tohiswrists, his
shoulders, hishipsand hisankles; adevice resembling astethoscope
wasattached tohischest andconnected totheamplifier.
“Get this straight,” said Dr. Ferris, addressing him forthe first
time. **Wewant you totake fullpower over theeconomy ofthe

Galtwaslooking straight atthem, hisface expressionless, asifhe

They heard thesound ofthestop-watch inthesilence, counting off
theseconds, andthesound ofMouch's choked, irregular breathing as
hegripped thearms othischair
Ferris waved asignal tothemechanic althemachine Theme-
chanic threw theswitch, itlighted theredglassbutton andsetofftwo

Gallopened hiseyesandglanced atthem toramoment They
could tellnothing except that hisglance wassteady and fully con-
1044
stious. Then hedropped hishead again andlay still, asifhehad
forgotten them.
Hisnaked body looked strangely outofplace inthis cellar. Theyknew it,though none ofthem would identify thatknowledge. The
long lines ofhisbody, running from hisankles tothe flathips to
theangle ofthewaist, tothestraight shoulders, looked likeastatue
ofancient Greece, sharing that statue’s meaning, butstylized toa
longer, lighter, more active formandagaunter strength, suggesting
more restless anenergy— thebody, notofachariot driver, butofa
builder ofairplanes. And asthemeaning ofastatue ofancient
Greece—thestatue ofman asagod— clashed with the spirit ofthis
century’s halls, sohisbody clashed with acellar devoted toprehistorical
activities, 'lbedashwasthegieater, because heseemed tobelong with
electric wires, with stainless steel, with precision instruments, with the
levers ofacontrol board Perhaps- thiswasthethought most fiercely
resisted andmost deeply buried atthebottom ofhiswatchers’ sensa-
tions. thethought theyknew only asadiffused hatred andanunfo-
cused terror— perhaps itwastheabsence olsuch statues from the
modern world thathadtransformed agenerator intoanoctopus and
brought abody such ashisinto itstentacles
“1understand you’re some sort oielectrical expert,” said Ferris,
andchuckled. “Soarewe-don’t youthink so?”
Twosounds answered him inthesilence: thedrone ofthegenera-
torandthebeating ofGalt’s heart
“The mixed scries!” ordered Ferris, waving one linger atthe
mechanic.
Theshocks nowcame atirregular, unpredictable inteivals. one
after another orminutes apart. Only theshuddering convulsions of
Galt’s legs, arms, torso orentire bodyshowed whether thecurrent
wasracing between twoparticular electrodes orthrough allofthem
atonce.Theneedles onthedials keptcoming dose totheredmarks,
then receding: themachine wascalculated toinflict themaximum
intensity ofpainwithout damaging thebody olthevictim.
Itwasthewatchers whofound itunbearable towaitthrough the
minutes ofthepauses filled with thesound oltheheartbeat: theheart
wasnowracing inanirregular rhythm. Thepauses were calculated to
letthatbeatslowdown, butallow norelief tothevictim, whohad
towait forashock atanymoment.
Galt layrelaxed, asifnotattempting tolight thepain, butsurren-
dering toit,notattempting tonegate it,buttobear it.When bis
lipsparted forbreath and asudden joltslammed them tight again,
hedidnotresist theshaking rigidity ofhisbody, butheletitvanish
theinstant thecurrent lefthim.Only theskin olhisfacewaspulled
tight,andthesealed lineofhislipstwisted sidewise once inawhile.
When ashock raced through hischest, thegold-copper strands of
hishairflewwith thejerking ofhishead, asifwaving inagustof
wind, beating against hisface, across hiseyes.Thewatchers won-
deredwhy hishairseemed tobegrowing darker, untilthey realized
that itwasdrenched insweat.
The terror ofhearing one’sown heart struggling asifabout to
burst atanymoment, hadbeen intended tobefeltbythevictim. It
1045
was(hetorturers whowere trembling with terror, asthey listened
tothejagged, broken rhythm andmissed abreath withevery missing
beat. Itsounded now asiftheheartwere leaping, beating frantically
against itscageofribs, inagony and inadesperate anger. Theheart
wasprotesting; themanwould not.Helay still, hiseyes closed, his
hands relaxed, hearing hisheart as itfought forhis life.
Wesley Mouch was firsttobreak.“OhGod, Floyd!'’ hescreamed.
‘’Don't killhim!Don’t dare killhim! Ifhedies,wedie!'’
“Hewon’t,” snarled Ferris. “He’ll wish hedid,buthewon’t! The
machine won’t lethim! It'smathematically computed! It’ssale!”
“Oh, isn’t itenough? He’llobey usnow!Fmsure he'llobey!”
“No! It’snotenough! Idon’t wanthim toobey! Iwanthimto

forusvoluntarily!”
“Goahead!” cried Taggart “What areyouwaiting for?Can't you
make thecurrent stronger? Hehasn’t evenscreamed yet!”
“What’s thematter withyou?" gasped Mouch, catching aglimpse
ofTaggart’s facewhile acuirentwastwisting Galt's body: Taggart
wasstaring atitintently, yethiseyesseemed glazed anddead, but
around thatinanimate stare themuscles ofhisfacewere pulled into
anobscene caricature ofenjoyment.
“Had enough?” Ferns kept yelling toGalt. “Are youready to
wantwhatwewant?”
They heard noanswer. Galt raised hishead once inawhile and
looked atthem. There were dark rings under hiseyes, buttheeves
were clearandconscious.
Inmounting panic, thewatchers lost their sense ofcontext ami
language—andtheir three voices blended intoaprogression ofindis-
criminate shrieks: “Wewantyoutotake over! ...Wewantyouto
/ule! . . .Weorder youtogive orders! .. .Wedemand thatyou
dictate! , ..Weorder youtosave us! ..Weorder youtothink! . .
They heard noanswer butthebeating oftheheartonwhich their
own livesdepended.
Thecurrent wasshooting through Galt’s chestandthebeating was
coming inirregular spurts, asifitwere racing andstumbling- -when
suddenly hisbody fell still, relaxing: thebeating hadstopped.
The silence was likeastunning blow, andbefore theyhadtime to
scream, their horror wastopped byanother: bythefact thatGalt
opened hiseyesandraised hishead.
Then they realized that thedrone otthemotor hadceased, too,
andthattheredlighthadgone outonthecontrol panel: thecurrent
hadslopped: thegenerator wasdead.
Themechanic wasjabbing hisfinger atthebutton tonoavail.He
yanked thelever oftheswitch again andagain!Hekicked theside of
themachine. Theredlightwould notgoon; thfesound didnotreturn
“Well?” snapped Ferris. “Well? What’s th$matter?”
“The generator's ontheblink,” saidthemechanic helplessly.
“What’s thematter with it?”
“1don’t know.”
”WcH, findoutand fixit!”
Themanwasnotatrained electrician; hehadbeen chosen, not
1046
forhisknowledge, butforhisuncritical capacity forpushing any
buttons; theeffort heneeded tolearn histaskwassuch that his
consciousness could berelied upon tohavenoroom foranything
else.Heopened therearpanel ofthemachine andstared inbewil-
derment attheintricate coils: hecould findnothing visibly outol
order.Heputonhisrubber gloves, picked upapairofpliers, tight-
ened afewbolts atrandom, andscratched hishead.
Idon tknow', hesaid; hisvoice had asound ofhelpless docility.“Whoam 1toknow?”
Thethreemenwereontheir feet,crowding behind themachine
tostare atitsrecalcitrant oigans. They were acting merely byreflex:
theyknew thatthey didnotknow.
“Bui you’ve gottotixil»”yelled Perris. ‘It'sgottowork! We’ve
gottohave electricity1”
“Wemust continue!” cried Taggart, hewasshaking. “It’s ridicu-
lous! 1won’t have it! Iwon’t beinterrupted! Iwon’t" lethimoff”
Hepointed inthedirection ofthemattress.
“Dosomething!” Penis wascrying tothemechanic “Don't just
stand there!Dosomething! Fix it! 1order youtofixit!”
“But ldon’tknow what’s wrong with it.”said theman, blinking.
“Then tindout!"
“Howam ltofindout”
“1order youtofix it!Doyouheatme?Make itwork-or i’lltire
youandthrow you injail!”
“But 1don'tknow what’s wrong with it.”Theman sighed, bewil-
dered, Tdon’tknow what todo.”
It’sthevibratoi that’s outoforder,” said avoice behind them;
they whirled around; Galtwas struggling torbreath, buthewas
speaking inthebrusque, competent tone otanengineer, ‘lake it
outandpry oflthealuminum cover. You'll findapair otcontacts
fused together. Force them apart, take asmall fileanddean upthe
pitted surfaces Then replace thecover, plug itback into thema-
chine- -andyour generatoi willwork”
There wasalongmoment oftotal silence.
Themechanic wasstaring atGalt, hewasholding Galt’s glance—
andeven hewasable torecognize thenature ofthesparkle inthe
darkgreen eyes: itwasasparkle ofcontemptuous mockery.
Hemade astepback. Intheincoherent dimness ofhisconscious-
ness, insome wordless, shapeless, unintelligible manner, evenhesud-
denly grasped themeaning otwhatwasoccurring inthat cellar.
Helooked atGalt -holooked atthethreemen— helooked at
themachine. Heshuddered, hedropped hispliers andranoutof
theroom.
Galt burst outlaughing.
Thethreemenwere backing slowly away from themachine. They
were struggling nottoallow themselves tounderstand what theme-
chanic hadunderstood.
“No!” cried Taggart suddenly, glancing atGaltandleaping for-
ward, “No! Iwon't lethimgetaway with it!”He felldownonhis
knees, groping frantically tofindthealuminum cylinder ofthevibra-
1047
tor.‘77/ fix it!I’llwork itmyself! We’ve gottogoon!We’ve got
tobreak him!”
“Take iteasy, Jim,” saidFerris uneasily, jerking himuptohisfeet.
“Hadn’t we . ,.hadn’t webetter layoffforthenight?” said
Mouch pleadingly; hewaslooking atthedoor through which the
mechanic hadescaped, hisglance part-envy, part-terror.
“No!” cried Taggart.
“Jim, hasn’t hehadenough? Don’t forget, wehave tobecareful,”
“No!Hehasn't hadenough! Hehasn’t evenscreamed yet!”
“Jim!” criedMouch suddenly, terrified bysomething inTaggart’s
face.“We can’t afford tokillhim!Youknow it!”
“Idon’t care! Iwant tobreak him! Iwant tohearhimscream! 1
want—”
And then itwasTaggart whoscreamed. Itwas along, sudden,

staring atspace andseemed blankly sightless. The sighthewascon-
fronting waswithin him.Theprotective walls ofemotion, ofevasion,
ofpretense, ofsemi-thinking andpseudo-words, builtupbyhim
through allofhisyears, hadcrashed inthespan ofonemoment—

fully that hisowndeath would follow'.
Hewassuddenly seeing themotive thathaddirected alltheactions
ofhis life. Itwasnothisincommunicable soulorhislove forothers
orhissocial duty oranyofthefraudulent sounds bywhich hehad
maintained hisself-esteem: itwasthe lusttodestroy whatever was
living, forthesake ofwhatever was not. Itwastheurge todefy
reality bythedestruction ofevery living value, forthesake ofprov-
ingtohimself thathecould exist indefiance ofreality andwould
never have tobebound byany solid, immutable facts.Amoment

thehatred wasproof ofGalt’s evil,which heneed define nofurther,
thathewanted Galt tobedestroyed forthesakeofhisown survival.
Now heknew thathehadwanted Galt’s destruction attheprice of
hisowndestruction tofollow, heknew thathehadnever wanted to
survive, heknew that itwasGalt’s greatness hehadwanted totorture

Itwasnotbymeans ofwords that hisknowledge confronted his

They pulled Taggart tohisfeet:hedidnotresist, heobeyed lethar-

Hesaved them from thenecessity ofadmitting tothemselves that
theywanted toescape Galt's eyes. Galtwaswatching them; his

“We llbeback," snapped Ferris tothechief oftheguards. “Stay

They pushed Taggart into their car,parked bythetrees atthe

Calmly andimpersonally, she,whowould have hesitated tofire at

Shepicked upthekey Irotn theground— then waited forafew

Francisco’s handwastoofastforthetwomen tosee itsmotion,
and hisgunwastoo silent. What theysawandheard nextwasthe

“Don't shoot, mister!" hecried.
“Come down here withyourhands up.”ordered Francisco, hold-

Bythetime theguard descended the stairs, Rcarden wasthere to
disarm him,andDanneskjtMd totiehishands and feet.The sight of
Dagny seemed tofrighten himmore than the rest;hecould not
understand it:thethreemenwore capsandwindbreakers, and,but
fortheir manner, could betaken foragang ofhighwaymen; the
presence ofaladywasinexplicable.
“Now.” said Francisco, “where isyour chief?”
Theguard jerked hishead inthedirection ofthe stairs. “Up
there.”
“How many guards arethere inthebudding'"
“Nine.”
,“Where arethey?”
“One's onthecellar stairs. Theothers are allupthere.”
“Where?”

“What arethese rooms?” Hepointed atthedoors leading off
the hall.
“They’re labs, too.They're locked forthenight.”
“Who’s gotthekey?”
“Him.” Hejerked hishead atPete.
Rearden andDanneskjold took thekeyfrom Pete's pocket and
hurried soundlessly tocheck therooms, while Francisco continued.
“Are there anyothermen inthebuilding?”
“No.”
“Isn’t there aprisoner here7”

pleadingly, “Mister, can 1askyouaquestion?”
“Goahead.”
“Who areyou?”
Heanswered inthesolemn toneofadrawing-room introduction

He lefttheguard gaping athimandturned toabrief, whispered

“Ifyoucame from headquarters, you’d know thatI’mnotsup-
posed toknow anything about anyprisoner—andthatnobody t$to

“Except me.”
Thechief leaped tohisfeet,darted toatelephone andseiyed the
receiver. Hehadnotraised ithalfway tohisearwhen hedropped
itabruptly withagesture thatsent avibration ofpanic through the
room: hehadhadtime tohear thatthetelephone wasdeadandto
know thatthewires were cut.
Hislook ofaccusation, ashewhirled toReardon, broke against the
faintly contemptuous reproof ofReardon’s voice: “That's nowayto
guard abuilding—ifthis iswhatyouallowed tohappen. Better letme
have theprisoner, before anything happens tohim—ifyoudon’t want
metoreport you fornegligence, aswell asinsubordination.”
The chief dropped heavily backonhischair, slumped lorward
across thetable andlooked upatRcarden with aglance thatmade
hisemaciated faceresemble theanimals thatwere beginning tostir

“Who istheprisoner7”heasked.
“Mygoodman,” saidRcarden, “Ifyourimmediate superiors did
notsee fittotellyou, Icertainly willnot.”
“They didn’t see fittotellmeabout yourcoming here, either!”
yelled thechief, hisvoice confessing thehelplessness ofanger and
broadcasting thevibrations ofimpotence tohismen.“How do 1

“That’s your problem, notmine.”

“But haven’t youheard?”
“What?”
“John Galthasmade adealwith thegovernment andhasbrought

“Oh, thank God!” cried oneoftheguards, theyoungest.
“Shut yourmouth! You’re nottohave any political opinions!”
snapped thechief, andjerked back toRcarden.' “Why hasn’t itbeen

“Doyoupresume toholdopinions onwhen andhowthegovern-

Oneoftheguards looked atthechief, dropped hisgunand, raising
hisarms, backed away from thegroup toward Rearden.
“Goddamn you!” yelled thechief, seized agunwith hislefthand
and fired atthedeserter.
Intime with the falloftheman's body, thewindow burst into a
shower ofglass-— andfrom thelimb ofatree, asfrom acatapult,
the tall,slender figure ofaman flew into theroom, landed on its
feetand fired atthe firstguard inreach.
“Who areyouV' screamed some terror-blinded voice,
“Ragnar Danncskjold.”
Three sounds answered him:along, swelling moan ofpanic—the
clatter offourgunsdropped tothefloor—andthebark otthe fifth,
firedbyaguard attheforehead ofthechief.
Bythetime thefoursurvivors ofthegarrison began toreassemble
thepieces oftheir consciousness, their figures were stretched onthe
floor, bound andgagged; the fifthonewas leftstanding, hishands
tiedbehind hisback.
“Where istheprisoner?” Francisco asked him.
“Inthecellar ... Iguess.”
“Who hasthekey?”
“Dr. Ferris.”
“Where arethestairs tothecellar 7”
“Behind adoor inDr.Ferris’ office.”
“Lead theway.”
Asthey started, Francisco turned toRearden. “Are you all
right.Hank?”
“Sure.”
“Need torest?”
“Hell, no!”
From thethreshold ofadoor inFerris' office. theylooked down
asteep flight ofstone stairs andsawaguard! onthelanding below.
“Come here withyourhands up!”ordered Francisco.
Theguard sawthesilhouette otaresol utefstranger andtheglint

Then thefour rescuers were free toflydown the stairs tothe
locked steeldoor atthebottom. They hadacted andmoved with
1056
theprecision ofacontrolled discipline. Now, itwasasiftheir inner
reinshadbroken.
Danneskjold hadthetools tosmash thelock. Francisco was first

which hadbeenthrown onthefloor inacorner oftheroom.“Do

“Sure,”
While Francisco andRearden were helping Galt todress, Dan-
neskjOld proceeded calmly, systematically, withnovisible emotion,
todemolish thetorture machine into splinters.
Galtwasnotfully steady onhisfeet, buthecould stand, leaning
onFrancisco’s shoulder. The firstfewsteps were hard, butbythe
time theyreached thedoor, hewasable toresume themotions of
walking. Hisonearm encircled Francisco’s shoulders forsupport;
hisother armheldDagny’s shoulders, both togainsupport andto
give it.
They didnotspeak astheywalked down the hill,with thedarkness

Thewheels were running faster, asifgaming speed andpurpose

when theysaw thedark shapes ofthetrees sweeping down and
dropping past theirwindows, Galt leaned silently overandpressed
hislipstoDagny’s hand; hewasleaving theouter world with the
onevalue hehadwanted towinfrom it.
Francisco hadproduced afirsi-aid kitandwasremoving Rearden’s

Rearden smiled. “Iwillrepeat whatyousaidwhen lthanked you,

There were notmany lights ontheearth below. Thecountryside
wasanempty black sheet, with afewoccasional flickers inthewin-
dows ofsomegovernment structuies. andthetrembling glow ofcan-
dles inthewindows ofthriftless homes. Most oftherural population
hadlong since beenreduced tothelifeofthose ageswhen artificial
lightwasanexorbitant luxury, andasunset putanend tohuman
activity. Thetowns were likescattered puddles, leftbehind bya
receding tide, stillholding some precious drops otelectricity, but
drying outinadesert ofrations, quotas, controls andpower-conser-
vation rules.
Butwhen theplace thathadonce been thesource ofthetide—
NewYork City—rose inthedistance before them, itwas stillex-
tending itstights tothesky, stilldefying theprimordial darkness,
almost asif,inanultimate effort, inafinalappeal forhelp, itwere
now stretching itsarms totheplane thatwascrossing itssky.Invol-
untarily, they satup,asifatrespectful attention atthedeath bedof
whathadbeen greatness.
Looking down, they could seethe lastconvulsions: thelights of
thecarswere darting through thestreets, likeanimals trapped ina
maze, frantically seeking anexit, thebridges werejammed with cars,
theapproaches tothebridges were veins ofmassed headlights, glit-
tering bottlenecks stopping allmotion, andthedesperate screaming
ofsirens reached faintly totheheight oftheplane. Thenews of
thecontinent’s severed artery hadnowengulfed thecity,menwere
deserting their posts, trying, inpanic, toabandon NewYork, seeking
escape where allroads were cutoffandescape wasnolonger
possible.
Theplane wasabove thepeaks oftheskyscrapers when suddenly,
with theabruptness otashudder, as iftheground hadparted to
engulf it,thecitydisappeared from theface oftheearth. Ittook
them amoment torealize that thepanic hadreached thepower
stations—andthatthelights ofNewYork hadgone out.
Oagny gasped. “Don’t lookdown!" Galtordered sharply.

“The engineer istrying tofindoutwhat's wrong. Mr.Willers," he
answered softly, inatoneimplying that itwas hisduty tohope, but
thathehadheldnohope foryears.
“He doesn't know?”
“He's working onit."Theconductor waited forapolite half-

‘Tknow," saidEddie Willers quietly.
Theconductor sensed that hisexplanation wasworse than none:
itledtoquestions thatmen didnotaskthese days.Heshook his
headandwent out.
Eddie Willers satlooking attheempty darkness beyond thewin-
dow. Thiswasthe firsteastbound Comet outotSanFrancisco in

Theconductor shrugged andshm»k hishead.
“Send Ihefireman toatrack phone Have* him telltheDivision

“Yes, sir,"
There wasnothing toseebeyond thewindows; turning offthe

howmenhadeverventured tocross it,and atwhat price, inthedays
1062
when there werenotrains.Hejerked hisheadawayandsnapped onthe light.
Itwasonly thefactthattheComet was inexile, hethought, that
gavehim thissense ofpressing anxiety. Shewas stalled onanalien
rail—ontheborrowed track oftheAtlantic Southern that ran
through Arizona, thetrack theywere using without payment. He
hadtogetheroutofhere, hethought, hewould notfeel like this

No,hethought, thatwasnot all.Hehadtoadmit tohimself what

mind, driving himwith thevagueness otapiayer andthescalding

other was;Don't let itgo! ...
Theconductor returned anhour later, with thefireman, whose
facelooked oddly grim.
“Mr. Willers," said thefireman slow!). “Division Headquarters

Eddie Willers satup,hismind refusing tobelieve it,yetknowing
suddenly that forsome inexplicable reason thiswaswhat hehad
expected. “It’s impossible!" hesaid, hisvoice low,thefireman was

“No, Mr.Willers. Itwasnotoutoforder. The linewas alive all

After awhile, itseemed tohimthathedistinguished some largeMack shapes advancing slowly, theyweremoving inalineparallelwiththetrack, thespotoflighthunglowover theground swinging;
hestrained hisears, butheard nothing.
Then hecaught afeeble, muffled beat thatsounded likethehoofs

with alook ofgrowing terror, asifsome supernatural apparition
were advancing upon them outofthedesert night. Inthemomentwhen theychuckled suddenly, joyously, recognizing theshapes it
wasEddie’s face that froze into alook ofterror atthesight ofa
ghostmore frightening thananytheycould have expected: itwasa

Theswinging lantern jerked toastopbythesidetheengine, ‘Hey,

Thepassengers oftheComet were peering outthewindows; some
were descending thestepsandapproaching. Women's facespeeked
from thewagons, Iromamong thepiles ofhousehold goods; ababy
wailed somewhere attherear ofthecaravan.
"Are youentry?" asked Eddie Willers.
"No. Imean it,brother. Wegotplenty ofroom.We llgiveyou

"TheComet, eh?Looks more likeadead caterpillar tome.What’s
thematter, brother? You’re notgoinganywhere— andyoucan’t get
there anymore, even ifyou tried."
"What doyoumean?"
"You don’t think you’re going toNew York, doyou?"
"We aregoing toNewYork"
"Then ,.*thenyouhaven't heard?"
"What?''
"Say,when wasthe tasttimeyouspoke toanyofyour stations?"

rayexplosion orsomething. Nobody knows exactly. Only there ain’t
anybridge anymore tocross theMississippi. There ain’tanyNew

Eddie Willers didnotknow whathappened next; hehad fallen
hack against thesideoftheengineer’s chair, staring attheopendoor
ofthemotor unit; hedidnotknowhowlonghestayed there, but
when, atlast,heturned hishead, hesaw thathewasalone. 'The
engineer andthefireman had leftthecab.There wasascramble of
voices outside, screams, sobs, shouted questions andthesound of
theside-show barker’s laughter.
Eddie pulled himself tothewindow ofthecab: theComet spas-
sengers andcrewwere crowding around theleader ofthecaravan
1065
and hissemi-ragged companions; hewaswaving hisloose arms in
gestures ofcommand. Some ofthebetter-dressed ladies from the
Comet—whose husbands hadapparently been firsttomake adeal—
were climbing aboard thecovered wagons, sobbing andclutching
their delicate make-up cases.
“Step right up,folks, step right up!” thebarker wasyelling cheer-
fully. “We’ll makeroom foreverybody! Abitcrowded, butmoving—
better than being lefthere forcoyote fodder! Thedayoftheiron
horse ispast! Altwegot isplain, old-fashioned horse! Slow, but

Eddie Willers climbed halfway down theladder onthesideofthe
engine, toseethecrowd andtobeheard. Hewaved onearm,hang-
ingontotherungs with theother. “You’re notgoing, areyou?” he
cried tohispassengers. “You’re notabandoning theComet?”
They drew' alittleaway from him, asiftheydidnotwant tolook

“What's thematter with thegrease-monkey?” asked thebarker,
pointing atEddie
“Mr. Willers,” saidtheconductor softly, “it'snouse . .
“Don’t abandon theComet!” cried Eddie Wipers. “Don’t let it

“Areyoucrazy?”cried thebarker "You’ve noideawhat's going

“No!” cried Eddie, clutching themetal rung as ilhewanted his

Thebarker shrugged. “Well, it’syour funeral!”
“Which wayareyougoing?” asked theengineer, notlooking at
Eddie.
“Just going, brother! Just looking forsome place tostop . . .

mean-minded tobecome thefounders of4secret, free settlement,
andnotmean-minded enough tobecome a|ang ofraiders; theyhad

“No” saidEddie.

“Getaway from here,” saidEddie Willers.
Heclimbed back intothecab—-when thewagons jerked forward

Then, suddenly, hefelttheblinding surge ofadesperate, righteous

righteous defiance, hewaspulling levers atrandom, hewasjerking

which wasdead, hewasgroping todistinguish theform ofsome

desperate battle wasfedbythat vision andwasfought for itssake.
Don’t let itgo! hismind wascrying- while hewasseeing the
streets ofNewYork—Don’t let itgo!—while hewasseeing thelights-
ofrailroad signals— Don’t let itgo—while hewasseeing thesmoke

thiswasthecountry based onmymoral premises andtheonlycoun-
