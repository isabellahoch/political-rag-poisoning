PREFACE
Thisbook isananalysis ofeconomic fallacies thatareat
lastsoprevalent that theyhave almost become anevir
orthodoxy. Theonething thathasprevented thishasbeen
theirovm self-contradictions, which have scattered those
who accept thesame premises intoahundred different
"schools,” forthesimple reason that itisimpossible in
matters touching practical Mfetobeconsistently wrong. But
thedifference between onenew school andanother is
merely thatonegroup wakes upearlier thananother tothe
absurdities towhich itsfalse premises aredriving it,and
becomes atthatmoment inconsistent byeither unwittingly
abandoning itsfalsepremises oraccepting conclusions from
them lessdisturbing orfantastic than those thatlogicwould
demand.
There isnotamajor government intheworld atthis
moment, however, whose economic policies arenot in-
fluenced ifthey arenotalmost wholly determined by
acceptance ofsome ofthese fallacies. Perhaps dieshortest
andsurestwaytoanunderstanding ofeconomics isthrough
adissection ofsuch errors, andparticularly ofthecentral
errorfromwhich they stem.That istheassumption ofthis

volume andofitssomewhat ambitious andbelligerent title.
Tbevolume istherefore primarily oneofexposition. It
makes noclaim tooriginality withregard toanyofthechief
ideas that itexpounds; Rather itseffort istoshow that
many oftheideaswhichnow pass forbrilliant innovations
andadvances areinfactmere revivals ofancient errors, and
afurther proof ofthedictum thatdiosewho areignorant
ofthepastarecondemned torepeat it.
Thepresent essay itself is,Isuppose, unblushingly “clas-
sical,” “traditional” and“orthodox:” atleast these arethe
epithets withwhich those whose sophisms arehere sub-
jected toanalysis willnodoubt attempt todismiss it.But
thestudent whose aim istoattain asmuch truth aspossible
willnotbefrightened bysuch adjectives. Hewillnotbe
forever seeking arevolution, a“fresh start,” ineconomic
thought. Hismind will, ofcourse, beasreceptive tonew

restless orexhibitionistic straining fornovelty and origi-
nality. AsMorris R.Cohen hasremarked: “The notion that
wecandismiss theviews ofallprevious thinkers surely
leaves nobasis forthehope thatourownwork willprove
ofanyvalue toothers.”^
Because this isawork ofexposition Ihave availed myself
freely andwithout detailed acknowledgment (except for
rarefootnotes andquotations) oftheideas ofothers. This
isinevitable when onewrites inafield inwhich many of
theworld’s finestminds have labored. Butmyindebtedness

isnottoexpose, thespecial errors ofparticular writers, but

popular stage, become anon3unous anyway. The subtleties

tried topresent statistical confirmation, inreferring tothe
effects oftariffs, price-fixing, inflation, andthecontrols
oversuchcommodities ascoal, rubber and cotton, would
have swollen thisbookmuch beyond thedimensions con-
templated. Asaworking newspaper man, moreover, Iam
acutely aware ofhowquickly statistics become out-of-date
andaresuperseded bylater figures. Those who areinter-
ested inspecific economic problems areadvised toread
current “realistic” discussions ofthem, with statistical docu-
mentation: they willnotfind itdifficult tointerpret the
statistics correctly inthelight ofthebasic principles they
have learned.
Ihave tried tovvrite thisbook assimply andwith as
much freedom from technicalities asisconsistent with
reasonable accuracy, sothat itcanbefullyunderstood bya
reader withnoprevious acquaintance with economics.

THELESSON
CHAPTER I
THELESSON
Economics ishaunted bymore fallacies than any
other studyknown toman.This isnoaccident. The
inherent difficulties ofthesubject would begreatenough
inanycase, butthey aremultiplied athousandfold bya
factor that isinsignificant in,say,physics, mathematics or
medicine— thespecial pleading ofselfish interests. While
every group hascertain economic interests identical with
those ofallgroups, every group hasalso, asweshall see,
interests antagonistic tothose ofallother groups. While
certain public policies would inthelongrunbenefit every-
body, other policies would benefit onegroup only atthe
expense ofallother groups. Thegroup thatwould benefit
bysuch policies, having such adirect interest inthem, will
argue forthem plausibly and persistently. Itwillhirethe
bestbuyable minds todevote theirwhole time topresenting
itscase.And itwill finally either convince thegeneral pub-
licthat itscase issound, orsobefuddle itthat clear think-
ingonthesubject becomes next toimpossible.
Inaddition tothese endless pleadings ofself-interest,
there isasecond main factor thatspawns neweconomic
fallacies every day.This isthepersistent tendency ofmen
toseeonly theimmediate effects ofagiven policy, orits
3
ECONOMICS INONELESSON
effects onlyonaspecial group, and toneglect toinquire
what thelong-run effects ofthatpolicy willbenotonlyon
that special group butonallgroups^ Itisthefallacy of
overlooking secondary consequences.
Inthis liesalmost thewhole difference between good
economics andbad.Thebadeconomist seesonlywhat im-
mediately strikes theeye; thegood economist also looks
beyond. Thebadeconomist seesonly thedirect conse-
quences ofaproposed course; thegood economist looks
also atthelonger andindirect consequences. Thebadecon-
omist seesonlywhat theeflFect ofagiven policy hasbeen or
willbeononeparticular group; thegoodeconomist inquires
alsowhat theeffect ofthepolicy willbeonallgroups.
The distinction mayseem obvious. The precaution of
looking foralltheconsequences ofagiven policy toevery-
onemayseem elementary. Doesn't everybody know, inhis
personal life,thatthere areallsorts ofindulgences delight-
fulatthemoment butdisastrous intheend? Doesn't every
littleboyknow that ifheeatsenough candy hewillget
sick? Doesn't thefellowwho getsdrunk know thathewill
wakeupnextmorning with aghastly stomach andahor-
head? Doesn't thedipsomaniac know thatheismin-
hisliverandshortening hislife?Doesn't theDonJuan
know thatheisletting himself inforevery sortofrisk,from
blackmail todisease? Finally, tobring ittotheeconomic
though stillpersonal realm, donottheidleranddiespend-
thrift know, even inthemidst oftheir glorious fling, that
areheading forafuture ofdebtandpoverty?
etwhenweenter thefieldofpublic economics, these
elementary truths areignored. There aremen regarded
THELESSON
f5
today asbrilliant economists, who deprecate saving and
recommend squandering onanational scale asthewayof
economic salvation; andwhen anyone points towhat the
consequences ofthese policies willbeinthelong run,they
reply flippantly, asmight theprodigal sonofawarning
father: 'Inthelongrunwearealldead/^Andsuchshallow
wisecracks pass asdevastating epigrams and the ripest
wisdom.
Butthetragedy isthat,onthecontrary, wearealready
suffering thelong-run consequences ofthepolicies ofthe
remote orrecent past.Today isalready thetomorrow which
thebadeconomist yesterday urged ustoignore. The long-
runconsequences ofsome economic policies maybecome
evident inafewmonths. Others maynotbecome evident
forseveral years. Still othersmaynotbecome evident for
decades. But inevery case those long-run consequences
arecontained inthepolicy assurely asthehenwasinthe
egg,theflower intheseed.
From thisaspect, therefore, thewhole ofeconomics can
bereduced toasingle lesson, andthatlesson canbereduced
toasingle sentence. The artofeconomics consists inlook-
ingnotmerely attheimmediate hutatthelonger effects of
anyactorfolicy; itconsists intracing theconsequences of
thatpolicy notmerely foronegroup hutforallgroups.
z
Nine-tenths oftheeconomic fallacies thatareworking
such dreadful harm intheworld today aretheresult of
'
6 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
ignoring this lesson. Those fallacies allstemfromoneof
twocentral fallacies, orboth: that oflooking only atthe
immediate consequences ofanactorproposal, andthatof
looking attheconsequences only foraparticular group to
theneglect ofother groups.
Itistrue, ofcourse, thattheopposite error ispossible. In
considering apolicyweought nottoconcentrate onlyon
itslong-run results tothecommunity asawhole. This is
theerror oftenmadebytheclassical economists. Itresulted
inacertain callousness toward thefateofgroups thatwere
immediately hurtbypolicies ordevelopments which proved
tobebeneficial onnetbalance andinthelong run.
Butcomparatively fewpeople todaymake thiserror;and
those few consist mainly ofprofessional economists. The
most frequent fallacy byfartoday, thefallacy thatemerges
again andagain innearly every conversation thattouches
oneconomic affairs, theerror ofathousand political
speeches, thecentral sophism ofthe^hew'^ economics, is
toconcentrate ontheshort-run effects ofpolicies onspecial
groups and toignore orbelittle thelong-run effects onthe
community asawhole. The^hew*^ economists flatter them- i
selves that this isagreat, almost arevolutionary advance
over themethods ofthexlassicaF or^hrthodox^^ econo-
mists, bedause theformer take intoconsideration short-run
effects which thelatter often ignored. Butinthemselves
ignoring orslighting thelong-run effects, they aremaking
thefarmore serious error.They overlook thewoods in
their precise andminute examination ofparticular trees.
Their methods andconclusions areoften profoundly reac-

THELESSON
tionary. They aresometimes surprised tofindthemselves
inaccord with seventeenth-century mercantilism. They
fall,infact, into alltheancient errors (orwould, ifthey
were notsoinconsistent) thattheclassical economists, we
hadhoped, hadonce for allgotridof.
Itisoften sadly remarked thatthebadeconomists pre
sent their errors tothepublic better than thegood econo^
mists present their truths. Itisoften complained thatdema-
gogues canbemore plausible inputting forward economic
nonsense from theplatform than thehonest menwho try
toshowwhat iswrong with it.Butthebasic reason for
thisought not tobemysterious. The reason isthat the
demagogues andbadeconomists arepresenting half-truths.
They arespeaking only oftheimmediate efltect ofapro-
posed policy oritseffect upon asingle group. Asfaras
theygotheymayoftenberight. Inthese cases theanswer
consists inshowing that theproposed policy would also
have longer and lessdesirable effects, orthat itcould benefit
onegroup only attheexpense ofallother groups. The
answer consists insupplementing andcorrecting thehalf-
truth with theother half.Buttoconsider allthechief ef-
fects ofaproposed course oneverybody often requires a
long, complicated, anddullchain ofreasoning. Most ofthe
audience finds thischain ofreasoning difficult tofollow
andsoonbecomes bored and inattentive. Thebadecono-
mists rationalize this intellectual debility and laziness by
8 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
assuring theaudience that itneed noteven attempt tofol-
lowthereasoning orJudge itonitsmerits because itis
only "classicism” or‘laissez faire” or"capitalist apologetics”
orwhatever other term ofabusemayhappen tostrikethem
aseflFective.
Wehave stated thenature ofthelesson, andofthefal-
lacies thatstand initsway, inabstract terms. Butthe les-
sonwillnotbedriven home, andthefallacies willcontinue
togounrecognized, unless both areillustrated byexamples.
Through these examples wecanmove from themost ele-
mentary problems ineconomics tothemostcomplex and
difficult. Through themwecanlearn todetect andavoid
firstthecrudest andmost palpable fallacies and finally
some ofthemost sophisticated and elusive. TothattasL
weshallnow proceed.

THELESSON APPLIED
CHAPTER II
THEBROKEN WINDOW
"'Fet usLegm with thesimplest illustration possible:
JL^ letus,emulating Bastiat, choose abroken pane of
glass.’
Ayoung hoodlum, say,heaves abrick through thewin-
dow ofabakeds shop.Theshopkeeper runs outfurious,
buttheboy isgone.Acrowd gathers, andbegins tostare
with quiet satisfaction atthegaping hole inthewindow
andtheshattered glass over thebread and pies. After a
while thecrowd feels theneed forphilosophic reflection.
And several ofitsmembers arealmost certain toremind
each other orthebaker that, after all,themisfortune has
itsbright side. Itwillmake business forsome glazier. As
theybegin tothink ofthisthey elaborate upon it.How
much does anew plate glasswindow cost? Fifty dollars?
That willbequite asum. After all, ifwindows were never
broken, whatwould happen totheglass business? Then,
ofcourse, thething isendless. The glazier willhave$50
more tospend with other merchants, and these inturn
willhave$50more tospend with stillother merchants,
andsoadinfinitum. Thesmashed window willgoonpro-
viding money andemployment inever-widening circles.
The logical conclusion from allthiswould be, ifthecrowd

drew it,thatthe littlehoodlum whothrew thehrick, far
from being apublic menace, was apublic benefactor.
Now letustakeanother look.Thecrowd isatleast right
initsfirstconclusion. This little actofvandalism willin
the firstinstance meanmore business forsome glazier. The
glazier willbenomoreunhappy tolearn oftheincident
thananundertaker tolearn ofadeath. Buttheshop-
keeper willbeout$50thathewasplanning tospend for

dowandasuithemustbecontent with thewindow and

thecommunity has lostanew suit thatmight otherwise
havecome intobeing, and isjustthatmuch poorer.
The glazier’s gain ofbusiness, inshort, ismerely the

CHAPTER III
THEBLESSINGS OF
DESTRUCTION.
SoWEhave finished with thebroken window. An
elementary fallacy. Anybody, onewould think, would
beable toavoid itafter afewmoments^ thought. Yetthe
broken-window fallacy, under ahundred disguises, isthe
most persistent inthehistory ofeconomics. Itismore
rampant nowthan atanytime inthepast. Itissolemnly
reaffirmed every daybygreat captains ofindustry, by
chambers ofcommerce, bylabor union leaders, byeditorial
writers andnewspaper columnists andradio commentators,
bylearned statisticians using themost refined techniques,
byprofessors ofeconomics inourbest universities. Intheir
various ways they alldilate upon theadvantages ofde-
struction.
Though some ofthemwould disdain tosaythatthere
arenetbenefits insmall actsofdestruction, they seealmost
endless benefits inenormous actsofdestruction. They tell
ushowmuch better offeconomically weallareinwarthan
inpeace. They see'miracles ofproduction^^ which itre-
quires awar toachieve. And they seeapost-war world
made certainly prosperous byanenormous "accumulated^^
or"backed-up"' demand. InEurope they joyously count
•'I
14 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
thehouses, thewhole cities thathavebeen leveled tothe
ground andthat “willhave tobereplaced.” InAmerica
theycount thehouses thatcould notbebuilt during the
war, thenylon stockings thatcould notbesupplied, the
worn-out automobiles and tires, theobsolescent radios and
refrigerators. They bring together formidable totals.
Itismerely ouroldfriend, thebroken-window fallacy,
innew clothing, andgrown fatbeyond recognition. This
time itissupported byawhole bundle ofrelated fallacies.
Itconfuses need,withdemand. Themorewardestroys, the
more itimpoverishes, diegreater is'thepostwirar need. In-
dubitably. Butneed isnotdemand; Effective economic
demand requires notmerely need butcorresponding pur-
chasing power. Theneeds ofChina today areincompa-
rably greater than theneeds ofAmerica. But itspurchas-
ingpower, andtherefore the“new business” that itcan
stimulate, areincomparably smaller.
But ifwegetpast thispoint, there isachance foran-
other fallacy, anddiebroken-windowites usually grab it.
They think of“purchasirig power” merely interms of
money.Nowmoney canberunoffbytheprinting press.
Asthis isbeing written, infact, printing money isthe
world’s biggest industry—^iftheproduct ismeasured in
monetary terms. Butthemoremoney isturned outinthis
way, themore thevalue ofanygiven unitofmoney falls.
This falling value canbemeasured inrising prices ofcom-
modities. Butasmost people aresofirmly inthehabit of
thinking ofdieir wealdi andincome interms ofmoney,
theyconsider themselves better offasthese monetary totals
THEBLESSINGS OFDESTRtTCTION 15
rise, inspite ofthefactthatinterms ofthings theymay
have lessandbuy less.Most ofthe'good'^ economic re-
sultswhich people attribute towararereally owing towar-
time inflation. They could beproduced just aswellbyan
equivalent peacetime inflation. Weshallcome back tothis
money illusion later.
Now there isahalf-truth inthe^"backed-up'^ demand
fallacy, just asthere was inthebroken-window fallacy.
Thebroken window didmakemore business fortheglazier.
The destruction ofwar willmake more business forthe
producers ofcertain things. The destruction ofhouses and
cities willmake more business forthebuilding andcon-
struction industries. The inability toproduce automobiles,
radios, and refrigerators during thewar willbring about
acumulative post-war demand forthosefarticular products.
Tomost people thiswillseem likeanincrease intotal
demand, asitmay wellheinterms ofdollars oflower
purchasing power. Butwhat really takes place isadiversion
ofdemand tothese particular products from others. The
people ofEurope willbuildmorenewhouses than other-
wisebecause theymust. Butwhen theybuildmore houses
they willhave justthatmuch lessmanpower andproduc-
tivecapacity leftover foreverything else.When theybuy
houses they willhave justthatmuch lesspurchasing power
foreverything else.Wherever business isincreased inone
direction, itmust (except insofar asproductive energies
maybegenerally stimulated byasense ofwant and
urgency) becorrespondingly reduced inanother.
Thewar, inshort, willchange thepost-war direction of
I
ECONOMICS INONELESSON l6
effort; itwillchange thebalance ofindustries; itwill
change thestructure ofindustry. And thisintime willalso
have itsconsequences. There willbeanother distribution
ofdemand when accumulated needs forhouses andother
durable goods havebeenmade up.Then these temporarily
favored industries will, relatively, have to;shrink again, to
allow other industries filling other needs togrow.
Itisimportant tokeep inmind, finally, thatthere will
notmerely beadifference inthepattern ofpost-war as
compared with pre-war demand. Demand willnotmerely
bediverted fromonecommodity toanother. Inmostcoun-
tries itwillshrink intotalamount.
This isinevitable whenweconsider thatdemand and
supply aremerely twosides ofthesame coin.They arethe
same thing looked atfrom different directions. Supply
creates demand because atbottom itisdemand. The sup-
plyofthething theymake isallthatpeople have, infact,
tooffer inexchange forthethings theywant. Inthissense
thefarmers’ supply ofwheat constitutes theirdemand for
automobiles andother goods. The supply ofmotor cars
constitutes thedemand ofthepeople intheautomobile in-
dustry forwheat andother goods. Allthis isinherent in
themodem division oflaborandinanexchange economy.
This fundamental fact, itistrue, isobscured formost
people (including some reputedly briUiant economists)
through such complications aswage payments andthein-
direct form inwhich virtually aUmodem exchanges are
made through themedium ofmoney. John Stuart Milland
other classical writers, though theysometimes failed totake
THEBLESSINGS OFDESTBUCTION I7
sufficient account ofthecomplex consequences resulting
from theuseofmoney, atleastsawthrough themonetary
veiltotheunderlying realities. Tothatextent theywere in
advance ofmany oftheir present-day critics, who arebe-
fuddled bymoney rather than instructed by it.Mere in-
flation—that is,themere issuance ofmore money, with
theconsequence ofhigher wages and prices—^may look
likethecreation ofmore demand. Butinterms ofthe
actual production andexchange ofrealthings itisnot.Yet
afallinpost-war demand maybeconcealed frommany
people bytheillusions caused byhigher money wages that
aremore than offset byhigher prices.
Post-war demand inmost countries, torepeat, willshrink
inabsolute amount ascompared withpre-war demand be-
cause post-war supply willhave shrunk. This should be
obvious enough inGermany andJapan, where scores of
great citieswere leveled totheground. The point, inshort,
isplainenough whenwemake thecaseextreme enough.
IfEngland, instead ofbeing hurtonly totheextent she
wasbyherparticipation inffiewar,hadhad allhergreat
cities destroyed, allherfactories destroyed andalmost all
heraccumulated capital andconsumer goods destroyed,
sothatherpeople hadbeenreduced totheeconomic level
oftheChinese, fewpeople would betalking about the
great accumulated andbacked-up demand caused bythe
war. Itwould beobvious thatbuying power hadbeen
wiped outtothesame extent thatproductive power had
beenwiped out.Arunaway monetary inflation, lifting
prices athousandfold, might none thelessmake the‘ha-
tional income” figures inmonetary terms higher than be-
forethewar.Butthosewhowould bedeceived bythat
into imagining themselves richer than before thewar
would bebeyond thereach ofrational argument. Yetthe
same principles apply toasmallwardestruction astoan
overwhelming one.
Theremay be,itistrue, offsetting factors. Technological
discoveries andadvances during thewar, forexample, may
increase individual ornational productivity atthispoint
orthat.Thedestruction ofwar will, itistrue, divert post-
wardemand fromsome channels into others. And acer-
tainnumber ofpeople maycontinue tobedeceived in-
definitely regarding their realeconomic welfare byrising
wages andprices caused byanexcess ofprinted money.
Butthebelief thatagenuine prosperity canbebrought
about bya"replacement demand” forthings destroyed
ornotmade during thewar isnone the lessapalpable
fallacy.

porteach other.Wecannot explore thatwhole network

^Veowe ittoourselves.” We shall return tosuch extraor-
dinary doctrines atalater point. Here Iamafraid thatwe
shallhave tobedogmatic, andpoint outthatsuch pleasant
dreams inthepasthave always been shattered bynational
insolvency orarunaway inflation. Hereweshallhave to
saysimply that allgovernment expenditures must eventu-
allybepaidoutoftheproceeds oftaxation; that toputoff
theevildaymerely increases theproblem, andthat infla-
tion itself ismerely aform,andaparticularly vicious form,
oftaxation.
Having putaside forlater consideration thenetwork of
fallacies which restonchronic government borrowing and
inflation, weshall take itforgranted throughout thepres-
entchapter that either immediately orultimately every
dollar ofgovernment spending must beraised through a
dollar oftaxation. Oncewelook atthematter inthisway,
thesupposed miracles ofgovernment spending willappear
inanother light
Acertain amount ofpublic spending isnecessary toper-
form essential government functions. Acertain amount of
public works— ofstreets androads andbridges andtun-
nels, ofarmories andnavy yards, ofbuildings tohouse
legislatures, police and firedepartments —isnecessary to
supply essential public services. With such public works,
necessaiy fortheirown sake,anddefended onthatground
alone, Iamnothereconcerned. Iamhereconcerned with
public works considered asameans of'providing em-
ployment” orofadding wealth tothecommunity that it
would nototherwise have had.

Ifrom them, there canbenoobjection. Butabridge built
iprimarily “toprovide employment” isadifferent kind of
Ibridge. When providing employment becomes theend,
I,needbecomes asubordinate consideration. “Projects” have
ttobeinvented. Instead offfiinldng onlywhere bridges must
[bebuilt, thegovernment spenders begin toaskthemselves
Iwhere bridges canbebuilt.Can they think ofplausible
reasons whyanadditional bridge should connect Easton
andWeston? Itsoonbecomes absolutely essential. Those
whodoubt thenecessity aredismissed asobstructionists
and reactionaries.
Twoarguments areputforward forthebridge, oneof
which ismainly heard before itisbuilt, theother ofwhich
I ismainly heard after ithasbeen completed. The firstargu-
fment isthat itwillprovide employment. Itwill provide,
say,500jobs forayear.The implication isthatthese are
jobsthatwould nototherwise havecome intoexistence.
This iswhat isimmediately seen.But ifwehave trained
ourselves tolookbeyond immediate tosecondary conse-
quences, andbeyond thosewhoaredirectly benefited bya
government project toothers who areindirectly affected,
adifferent picture presents itself. Itistruethataparticu-
largroup ofbridgeworkers may receive moreemployment
Ithan otherwise. Butthebridge hastobepaid foroutof

taxes. Forevery dollar that isspent onthebridge adollar
willhetaken away from taxpayers. Ifthebridge costs
$1,000,000 thetaxpayers will lose$1,000,000. They will
have thatmuch taken away fromthemwhich theywould
otherwise have spent onthethings theyneeded most.
Therefore forevery public jobcreated bythebridge
project aprivate jobhasbeen destroyed somewhere else.
Wecanseethemenemployed onthebridge.Wecan
watch them atwork.Theemployment argument ofthe
government spenders becomes vivid, andprobably formost
people convincing. Butthere areother things thatwedo
not see,because, alas,theyhave never been permitted to
come into existence. They arethejobs destroyed bythe
$1,000,000 taken from thetaxpayers. Allthathashap-
pened, atbest, isthat there hasbeen adiversion ofjobs
because oftheproject. More bridge builders; fewer auto-
mobile workers, radio technicians, clothing workers,
farmers.
Butthenwecome tothesecond argument. The bridge
exists. Itis,letussuppose, abeautiful andnotanugly
bridge. Ithascome intobeing through themagic ofgovern-
ment spending. Where would ithavebeen iftheobstruc-
tionists andthereactionaries hadhad dieirway? There
would havebeennobridge. Thecountry would havebeen
justthatmuch poorer.
Here again thegovernment spenders have thebetter of
theargument with allthosewhocannot seebeyond the
immediate range oftheir physical eyes.They canseethe
bridge. But iftheyhave taught themselves tolook forin-
POBLIG WORKS MEAN TAXES 23
direct aswell asdirect consequences theycanoncemore
seeintheeyeofimagination thepossibilities thathave
never been allowed tocome into existence. They cansee
theunbuilt homes, theunmade carsand radios, theun-
made dresses and coats, perhaps theunsold andungrown
foodstuffs. Toseethese uncreated things requires akind
ofimagination thatnotmany people have.Wecanthink
ofthese non-existent objects once, perhaps, butwecam
notkeepthem before ourminds aswecanthebridge that
wepassevery working day.What hashappened ismerely
thatonething hasbeen created instead ofothers.
Thesame reasoning applies, ofcourse, toevery other
form ofpublic work. Itapplies just aswell, forexample,
totheerection with public funds ofhousing forpeople of
lowincomes. Allthathappens isthatmoney istakenaway
through taxes from families ofhigher income (and per-
hapsalittlefrom families ofevenlower income) toforce
them tosubsidize these selected families withlowincomes
andenable them tolive inbetter housing forthesame
rentorforlower rentthan previously,
Idonotintend toenter here into alltheprosandcons
ofpublic housing. Iamconcerned only topoint outthe
error intwoofthearguments most frequently put for-,
ward infavor ofpublic housing. One istheargument
that it''creates employment''; theother that itcreates
wealth which would nototherwise havebeen produced.
M ECONOMICS INONELESSON
Both ofthese arguments arefalse, because they overlook
what islostthrough taxation. Taxation forpublic housing
destroys asmany jobs inother lines asitcreates in
housing. Italso results inunbuilt private homes, inun-
made washing machines and refrigerators, andinlackof
innumerable odier commodities and services.
Andnone ofthis isanswered bythesortofreplywhich
points out,forexample, thatpublic housing doesnothave
tobefinanced byalumpsum capital appropriation, but
merely byannual rent subsidies. This simply means that
thecost isspread overmany years instead ofbeing con-
centrated inone. Italsomeans thatwhat istaken from
thetaxpayers isspread overmany years instead ofbeing
concentrated into one.Such technicalities areirrelevant
tothemain point.
The great psychological advantage ofthepublic housing
advocates isthatmen areseen atworkonthehouses when
they aregoing up,andthehouses areseenwhen they are
finished. People live inthem, andproudly show their
friends through therooms. Thejobsdestroyed bythetaxes
forthehousing arenotseen, norarethegoods and serv-
icesthatwere never made. Ittakes aconcentrated effort
ofthought, andanew effort eachtimethehouses andthe
^^PPypeople inthem areseen, tothink ofthewealth that
wasnotcreated instead. Isitsurprising thatthechampions
ofpublic housing should dismiss this, ifitisbrought to
their attention, asaworld ofimagination, astheobjections
ofpure theory, while theypoint tothepublic housing that
exists? Asacharacter inBernard Shaw’s Saint Joan replies
PUBLIC WORKS MEAN TAXES 25
when toldofthetheory ofPythagoras thattheearth is
round andrevolves around thesun:“What anutter fool!
Couldn’t heusehiseyes?”
Wemust apply thesame reasoning, oncemore, togreat
projects liketheTennessee Valley Authority. Here, be-
cause ofsheer size,thedanger ofoptical illusion isgreater
than ever.Here isamighty dam, astupendous arcof
steeland concrete, “greater than anything that private
capital could have built,” thefetish ofphotographers, the
heaven ofsocialists, themost often used syrnlx)! ofthe
miracles ofpublic construction, ownership andoperation.
Here aremighty generators andpower houses. Here isa
whole region lifted toahigher economic level, attracting
factories andindustries thatcould nototherwise have ex-
isted.And itisallpresented, inthepaneg3o:ics ofitspar-
tisans, asaneteconomic gainwithout offsets.
Weneed notgohere intothemerits oftheTVA or
public projects like it.But thistimeweneed aspecial ef-
fortoftheimagination, which fewpeople seem able to
make, tolook atthedebit sideoftheledger. Iftaxes are
taken from people andcorporations, andspent inonepar-
ticular section ofthecountry, whyshould itcause surprise,
whyshould itberegarded asamiracle, ifthat section be-
comes comparatively richer? Other sections ofthecountry,
weshould remember, arethen comparatively poorer. The
thing sogreat that“private capital could nothave built it”
hasinfactbeen builtbyprivate capital—^thecapital that
wasexpropriated intaxes (or, ifthemoney wasborrowed,
thateventually mustbeexpropriated intaxes). Againwe

mustmake aneffort oftheimagination toseetheprivate
power plants, theprivate homes, thetypewriters andradios
thatwere never allowed tocome intoexistence hecause of
themoney thatwastaken from people alloverthecountry
tobuild thephotogenic Norris Dam.

Ihave deliberately chosen themost favorable examples
ofpublic spending schemes—that is,those that arembst
frequently andfervently urged bythegovernment spend-
ersandmost highly regarded bythepublic. Ihave not
spoken ofthehundreds ofboondoggling projects thatare
invariably embarked upon themoment themain object is
to'give jobs^^and"toputpeople towork.'" Forthen the
usefulness oftheproject itself, aswehave seen, inevitably
becomes asubordinate consideration. Moreover, themore
wasteful thework, themore costly inmanpower, thebetter
itbecomes forthepurpose ofproviding more employment.
Under such circumstances itishighly improbable thatthe
projects thought upbythebureaucrats willprovide the
same netaddition towealth and welfare, perdollar ex-
pended, aswould have been provided bythetaxpayers
themselves, iftheyhadbeen individually permitted tobuy
orhavemade what they themselves wanted, instead of
being forced tosurrender partoftheir earnings tothestate.
CHAPTER V
TAXES DISCOURAGE
PRODUCTION
There isastill further factor which mates itim-
probable that thewealth created bygovernment
s;^ending will fully compensate forthewealth destroyed
bythetaxesimposed topayforthatspending. Itisnota
simple question, assooften supposed, oftaking some-
thing outofthenation sright-hand pocket toputinto its
left-hand pocket. Thegovernment spenders tellus,fdrex-
ample, that ifthenational income is$200,000,000,000
(they arealways generous infixing thisfigure) then gov-
ernment taxes of$50,000,000,000 ayearwould mean that
only25percent ofthenational income wasbeing trans-
ferred from private purposes topublic purposes. This is
totalk asifthecountry were thesame sortofunit of
pooled resources asahuge corporation, and asifallthat
were involved were amere bookkeeping transaction. The
government spenders forget thatthey aretaking themoney
fromAinorder topay ittoB,Orrather, theyknow this
very well; butwhile they dilate upon allthebenefits of
theprocess toB,and allthewonderful things hewillhave
which hewould nothavehad ifthemoney hadnotbeen
transferred tohim, they forget the ejSFects ofthetransaction
onA.Bisseen;Aisforgotten.
28 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
Inourmodem world there isnever thesame percentage
ofincome taxlevied oneverybody. The great burden of
income taxes isimposed onaminor percentage ofthena-
tions income; and these income taxes have tobesup-
plemented bytaxes ofother kinds. These taxes inevitably
affect theactions andincentives ofthose fromwhom they
aretaken.When acorporation loses ahundred cents of
every dollar itloses,and ispermitted tokeep only60cents
ofevery dollar itgains, andwhen itcannot offset itsyears
oflosses against itsyears ofgains, orcannot dosoade-
quately, itspolicies are aflFected. Itdoes notexpand its
operations, oritexpands only those attended with amini-
mum ofrisk.People who recognize this situation arede-
terred from starting new enterprises. Thus oldemployers
donotgivemore emplo)7ment, ornotasmuch more as
theymight have;andothers decide nottobecome employ-
ersatall.Improved machinery andbetter-equipped fac-
tories come into existence much more slowly than they
otherwise would. The result inthelongrun isthatcon-
sumers areprevented from getting better andcheaper prod-
ucts,andthat realwages arehelddown.
There isasimilar effectwhen personal incomes aretaxed
50,60,75and90percent. People begin toaskthemselves
whytheyshould work six,eight ortenmonths oftheentire
year forthegovernment, andonly six,fourortwomonths
forthemselves and their families. Ifthey losethewhole
dollarwhen they lose,butcankeeponlyadime ofitwhen
theywin, they decide that itisfoolish totake riskswith
their capital. Inaddition, thecapital available forrisk-tak-
TAXES DISCOURAGE PRODUCTION 29
ing itself shrinks enormously. Itisbeing taxed away be-
fore itcanbeaccumulated. Inbrief, capital toprovide new
private jobs isfirstprevented fromcoming into existence,
andthepart thatdoescome into existence isthen dis-
couraged from starting new enterprises. Thegovernment
spenders create theveryproblem ofunemployment that
they profess tosolve.
Acertain amount oftaxes isofcourse indispensable to
carryonessential government functions. Reasonable taxes
forthispurpose need nothurtproduction much. Thekind
ofgovernment services then supplied inreturn, which
among other things safeguard production itself, more than
compensate forthis.Butthelarger thepercentage ofthe
national income taken bytaxes thegreater thedeterrent
toprivate production andemployment. When thetotal tax
burden grows beyond abearable size, theproblem ofde-
vising taxes that willnotdiscourage anddisrupt produc-
tionbecomes insoluble.
CHAPTER VI
CREDITDIVE RTS
PRODUCTION
Government “encouragement” tobusiness issome-
times asmuch tobefeared asgovernment hostility.
This supposed encouragement often takes theform ofa
direct grant ofgovernment credit oraguarantee ofprivate
loans.
Thequestion ofgovernment credit canoften becompli-
cated, because itinvolves thepossibility ofinflation. We
shall defer analysis oftheeffects ofinflation ofvarious
kinds untilalater chapter. Here, forthesakeofsimplicity,
weshallassume thatthecreditwearediscussing isnon-
inflationary. Inflation, asweshall later see,while itcom-
plicates theanalysis, does notatbottom change thecon-
sequences ofthepolicies discussed.
Themost frequent proposal ofthis sortinCongress is
formore credit tofarmers. Intheeyes ofmost Congress-
men thefarmers simply cannot getenough credit. The
credit supplied byprivate mortgage companies, insurance
companies orcountry banks isnever "adequate.'' Congress
isalways finding newgaps thatarenotfilledbytheexisting
lending institutions, nomatter howmany ofthese ithas
itself already brought intoexistence. Thefarmers mayhave
CREDIT DIVERTS PRODnCTION
enough long-term credit orenough short-term credit, hut,
itturns out,theyhave notenough ^intermediate^^ credit;
ortheinterest rate istoohigh; orthecomplaint isthat
private loans aremade only torichand well-established
farmers.’ Sonew lending institutions andnew types of
farm loans arepiledontopofeach otherbythelegislature.
The faith inallthese policies, itwillbefound, springs
fromtwo actsofshortsightedness. One istolook atthe
matter onlyfrom thestandpoint ofthefarmers that bor-
row.The other istothink only ofthe firsthalf ofthe
transaction.
Now allloans, intheeyes ofhonest borrowers, must
eventually berepaid. Allcredit isdebt. Proposals foran
increased volume ofcredit, therefore, aremerely another
name forproposals foranincreased burden ofdebt.They
would seem considerably lessinviting iftheywere habitu-
allyreferred tobythesecond name instead ofbythe first.
Weneed notdiscuss here thenormal loans that are
made tofarmers through private sources. They consist of
mortgages; ofinstallment credits forthepurchase ofauto-
mobiles, refrigerators, radios, tractors andother farmma-
chinery, andofbank loansmade tocarry thefarmer along
untilheisable toharvest andmarket hiscropandgetpaid
for it.Hereweneed concern ourselves only with loans
tofanners eithermade directly bysomegovernment bureau
orguaranteed by it.
These loans areoftwomain types.One isaloan to
enable thefarmer tohold hiscrop offthemarket. This is
anespecially harmful type; but itwillbemore convenient
32. ECONOMICS INONELESSON
toconsider itlaterwhenwecome tothequestion ofgov-
ernment commodity controls. The other isaloan topro-
vide capital—often tosetthefarmer upinbusiness by
enabling him tobuythefarm itself, oramule ortractor,
orallthree.
Atfirstglance diecaseforthistypeofloanmayseem a
strong one.Here isapoor family, itwillbesaid,withno
means oflivelihood. Itiscruelandwasteful toputthem
onrelief. Buyafarm forthem; setthemupinbusiness;
malce productive and self-respecting citizens ofthem; let
them add tothetotal national product andpaytheloan
offoutofwhat theyproduce^ Orhere isafarmer strugghng
along with primitive methods ofproduction because hehas
notthecapital tobuyhimself atractor. Lendhim the
money forone; lethim increase hisproductivity; hecan
repay theloanoutoftheproceeds ofhisincreased crops.
Inthatwayyounotonly enrich himandputhimonhis
feet;youenrich thewhole community bythatmuch added
output. And theloan, concludes theargument, costs die
government andthetaxpayers lessthan nothing, because
itis“self-liquidating.’’
Now asamatter offact this iswhathappens every day
under ^the institution ofprivate credit. Ifamanwishes to
buyairp^, andhas, letussay,onlyhalforadiird asmuch
money asthefarm’costs, aneighbor orasavings bank will
lendhimtherestintheform ofamortgage onthefarm.
Ifhewishes tobuy atractor, thetractor company itself,
orafinance company, willallowhim tobuy itforone-third
ofthepurchase pricewith theresttobepaid offininstall-
CREDIT DIVERTS PRODUCTION 33
ments outofearnings thatthetractor itself willhelp to
provide.
Butthere isadecisive difference between theloans sup-
pliedbyprivate lenders andtheloans supplied byagov-
ernment agency. Each private lender risks hisown funds.
(Abanker, itistrue, risks thefunds ofothers thathave
been entrusted tohim;but ifmoney islosthemust either
make good outofhisownfunds orbeforced outofbusi-
ness.)When people risktheirownfunds they areusually
careful intheir investigations todetermine theadequacy
oftheassets pledged andthebusiness acumen andhonesty
oftheborrower.
Ifthegovernment operated bythesame strict standards,
therewould benogoodargument foritsentering thefield
atall.Why doprecisely what private agencies already do?
Butthegovernment almost invariably operates bydifferent
standards. Thewhole argument foritsentering thelending
business, infact, isthat itwillmake loans topeople who
could notgetthem from private lenders. This isonly an-
otherwayofsaying thatthegovernment lenders willtake
risks with other people’s money (the taxpayers’) that
private lenders willnottakewith theirownmoney. Some-
times, infact, apologists will freely acknowledge thatthe
percentage oflosses willbehigher onthese government
loans thanonprivate loans. Buttheycontend that this
willbemore than offset bytheadded production brought
intoexistence bydieborrowers whopayback, andeven
bymost oftheborrowers whodonotpayback.
Thisargument willseem plausible only aslong aswe
ECONOMICS INONELESSON
concentrate ourattention ontheparticular borrowers whom
thegovernment supphes with funds, and overlook the
peoplewhom itsplan deprives offunds. Forwhat isreally
being lent isnotmoney, which ismerely themedium of
exchange, but capital. (Ihave already putthereader on
notice thatweshallpostpone toalaterpoint thecomplica-
tions introduced byaninflationary expansion ofcredit.)
What isreally being lent, say, isthefarm orthetractor
itself.Now thenumber offarms inexistence islimited,
andsoistheproducton oftractors (assuming, especially,
thataneconomic surplus oftractors isnotproduced simply
attheexpense ofother things). Thefarm ortractor that
islent toAcannot belent toB.The realquestion is,
therefore, whetherAorBshall getthefarm.
'ITiis brings ustotherespective merits ofAandB,and
what each contributes, oriscapable ofcontributing, topro-
duction. A,letussay, isthemanwhowould getthefarm
ifthegovernment didnotintervene. The localbanker or
hisneighbors knowhimandknow hisrecord. They want
tofindemployment fortheir funds. Theyknow thatheis
agood farmer andanhonest manwhokeeps hisword.
They consider himagood risk.Hehasalready, perhaps,
through industry, frugality and foresight, accumulated
enough cash topayafourth oftheprice ofthefarm.They
lendhimtheother three-fourths; andhegetsthefarm.
There isastrange idea abroad, heldbyallmonetary
cranks, that credit issomething abanker gives toaman.
Credit, onthecontrary, issomething aman already has.
Hehas it,perhaps, because healready hasmarketable
W'
If
.
CREDIT DIVERTS PRODaCTION 35
* assets ofagreater cashvalue than theloan forwhich he
isasking. Orhehas itbecause hischaracter andpast rec-
ordhave earned it.Hebrings itintothebank withhim.
That iswhy thebanker makes himtheloan.Thebanker
isnotgiving something fornothing. Hefeels assured of
lepayment. He ismerely exchanging amore liquid form
ofasset orcredit foralessliquid form. Sometimes hemakes
amistake, andthen itisnotonly thebanker who suffers,
butthewhole community; forvalues which were supposed
tobeproduced bythelender arenotproduced and re-
I sources arewasted.
Now itistoA,letussay,whohascredit, thatthebanker
would make hisloan. Butthegovernment goes intothe
lending business inacharitable frame ofmind because, as
wesaw, itisworried about B.Bcannot getamortgage
orother loans from private lenders because hedoes not
have credit with them.Hehasnosavings; hehasnoim-
pressive record asagood farmer; heisperhaps atthe
moment onrelief.Why not,saytheadvocates ofgovern-
ment credit, makehim auseful andproductive member
ofsociety bylending himenough forafarmandamule
ortractor and setting himupinbusiness?
Perhaps inanindividual case itmaywork out allright.
But itisobvious that ingeneral thepeople selected by
these government standards willbepoorer risksthan the
people selected byprivate standards. Moremoney willbe
lostbyloans tothem. There willbeamuch higher per-
centage offailures among them.They willbeless efficient.
More resources willbewasted bythem. Yettherecipients
ECONOMICS INONELESSON 36
ofgovernment credit willgettheir farms and tractors at
theexpense ofwhat otherwise would havebeen therecipi-
entsofprivate credit. Because Bhasafarm,Awillhede-
prived ofafarm.Amaybesqueezed outeither because
interest rateshavegoneupasaresult ofthegovernment
operations, orbecause farm prices havebeen forced upas
aresult ofthem, orbecause there isnoother farm tobe
hadinhisneighborhood. Inanycasethenetresult ofgov-
ernment credit hasnotbeen toincrease theamount of
wealth produced bythecommunity buttoreduce it,be-
cause theavailable realcapital (consisting ofactual farms,
tractors, etc.)hasbeen placed inthehands oftheless eflGi-
cient borrowers rather than inthehands ofthemore effi-
cient andtrustworthy.
2
The casebecomes even clearer ifweturnfromfarming
toother forms ofbusiness. Theproposal isfrequently made
thatthegovernment ought toassume the risks that are
I “too great forprivate industry.” Thismeans thatbureau-
cratsshould bepermitted totake riskswith thetaxpayers’
; money thatnoone iswilling totakewith hisown.
ISuch apolicy would lead toevils ofmany different
kinds. Itwould lead tofavoritism: tothemaking ofloans
tofriends, orinreturn forbribes. Itwould inevitably lead
toscandals. Itwould lead torecriminations whenever the
taxpayers’ money wasthrown away onenterprises that
failed. Itwould increase thedemand forsocialism: for, it
would properly beasked, ifthegovernment isgoing to
CREDIT DIVERTS PRODUCTION 37
beartherisks,whyshould itnotalsogettheprofits? What
justification could there possibly be,infact, forasking the
taxpayers totaketheriskswhile permitting private capital-
iststokeep theprofits? CThis isprecisely, however, aswe
shall later see,whatwealready dointhecase of“non-
recourse” govenunent loans tofanners.)
Butweshall passover allthese evils forthemomentj
andconcentrate onjustoneconsequence ofloans ofthis
type.This isthatthey willwaste capital andreduce pro-
duction. They willthrow theavailable capital intobador
atbestdubious projects. They willthrow itintothehands
ofpersons who are lesscompetent orlesstrustworthy
than thosewhowould otherwise have got it.Forthe
amount ofreal capital atanymoment (asdistinguished
from monetary tokens run oflFonaprinting press) is
limited. What isputintothehands ofBcannot beputinto
thehands ofA.
People want toinvest theirovm capital. Butthey are
cautious. They want toget itback.Most lenders, there-
fore, investigate anyproposal carefully before they risktheir
ownmoney init.They weigh theprospect ofprofits against
thechances ofloss.Theymaysometimes make mistakes.
Butforseveral reasons they arelikely tomake fewer mis-
takes than government lenders. Inthe first place, the
money iseither theirownorhasbeen voluntarily entrusted
tothem. Inthecaseofgovernment-lending themoney is
»that ofother people, and ithasbeen taken from them,
regardless oftheir personal xvish, intaxes.The private
money willbeinvested onlywhere repayment with in*
z1
ECONOMICS INONELESSON 38
terest orprofit isdefinitely expected. This isasign that
thepersons towhom themoney hasbeen lent willbeex-
pected toproduce things forthemarket thatpeople actually
want.Thegovernment money, ontheother hand, islikely
tobelent forsomevague general purpose like'creating
employment;^' andthemore inefficient thework—that is,
thegreater thevolume ofemployment itrequires inrela-
tion tothevalue ofproduct—themore highly thought of
theinvestment islikely tobe.
The private lenders, moreover, areselected byacruel
market test. Iftheymake badmistakes they lose their
money andhavenomoremoney tolend. Itisonly ifthey
havebeen successful inthepastthattheyhavemoremoney
tolend inthefuture. Thus private lenders (except the
relatively small proportion thathave got their funds
through inheritance) arerigidly selected byaprocess ofsur-
vival ofthe fittest.Thegovernment lenders, ontheother
hand, ateeither thosewhohave passed civil service exam-
inations, andknowhow toanswer hypothetical questions
hypothetically, orthey arethosewhocangive themost
plausible reasons formaking loans andthemost plausible
explanations ofwhy itwasn't their fault that theloans
failed. Butthenetresult remains: private loans will utilize
existing resources and capital farbetter thangovernment
loans. Government loans willwaste farmore capital and
resources than private loans. Government loans, inshort,
ascompared with private loans, willreduce production, not
increase it.

Weremarked atthebeginning ofthischapter thatgov-

THECURSE OFMACHINERY
Among themost viable ofalleconomic delusions isthe
ubelief thatmachines onnetbalance create un-
employment. Destroyed athousand times, ithasrisen a
thousand times outofitsown ashes ashardy andvigorous
asever.Whenever there islong-continued massunem-
ployment, machines gettheblame anew. This fallacy is
stillthebasis ofmany labor union practices. The public
tolerates these practices because iteither believes atbottom
thattheunions areright,* oristooconfused toseejust
whythey arewrong.
The belief thatmachines cause unemployment, when
held withany logical consistency, leads topreposterous
conclusions. Notonlymustwebecausing unemployment
with every technological improvement wemake today, but
primitive manmust have started causing itwith the first
efforts hemade tosavehimself from needless toiland
sweat.

Things could beblacker, fortheIndustrial Revolution
wasjustinitsinfancy. Letuslook atsome oftheincidents
and aspects ofthat revolution. Letussee, forexample,
what happened inthestocking industry. New stocking
frames astheywere introduced were destroyed bythe
handicraft workmen (over 1,000 inasingle riot), houses
were burned, theinventors were threatened andobliged
toflyfortheir lives, andorder wasnot finally restored
until themilitary hadbeen called outand theleading
rioters hadbeen either transported orhanged.
Now itisimportant tobear inmind that insofaras
therioters were thinking oftheirownimmediate oreven
longer futures their opposition tothemachine was ra-
tional. ForWilliam Felkin, inhisHistory oftheMachine-
Wrought Hosiery Manufactures (1867), tellsusthatthe
larger part ofthe50,000 English stocking knitters and
their families didnotfullyemerge from thehunger and
misery entailed bytheintroduction ofthemachine forthe
next forty years. Butinsofarastherioters believed, as

Arkwright invented hiscotton-spinning machinery in
1760. Atthattime itwasestimated that there were in
England 5,200 spinners using spinning wheels, and2,700
weavers^in all,7,900 persons engaged intheproduction
ofcotton textiles. The introduction ofArkwright’s inven-
tionwasopposed ontheground that itthreatened the
livelihood oftheworkers, andtheopposition had tobe
putdown byforce. Yetin1787— twenty-seven years after
theinvention appeared—aparliamentary inquiry showed

thatthenumber ofpersons actually engaged inthespin-
ningandweaving ofcotton had risen from 7,900 to
320,000, anincrease of4,400 percent.

Mr.Wells topause, andwonder why there wasanyem-

concluded, with restrained pessimism, that ^'under such
circumstances industrial overproduction . . .maybecome

Inthedepression of1932, thegame ofblaming unem-
ployment onthemachines started allover again. Within a
fewmonths thedoctrines ofagroup calling themselves
theTechnocrats hadspread through thecountry likea

' tions toshow what thereal facts were. Itisenough to
saythat theTechnocrats returned totheerror inallits
native purity thatmachines permanently displace men—
except that, intheir ignorance, theypresented thiserror as
anewandrevolutionary discovery oftheir ovm. Itwas
; simply onemore illustration ofSantayana saphorism that
thosewhocannot remember thepastarecondemned tore-
peat it.
‘TheTechnocrats were finally laughed outofexistence;
buttheir doctrine, which preceded them, lingers on. Itis
reflected inhundreds ofmake-work ralesandfeather-bed
practices bylabor unions; and these ralesand practices
aretolerated andevenapproved because oftheconfusion

Testifying onbehalf oftheUnited States Department

with refusal toinstall electrical equipment made outside of

Invarious cities theelectrical union required that ifany

ber 19,1945, wrote: 'We have reached apoint today
where labor-saving devices aregood onlywhen theydo
notthrow theworker outofhisjob.”
Ifitwere indeed true that theintroduction oflabor
saving machinery isacause ofconstantly mounting un-
employment and misery, the logical conclusions tobe
drawn would berevolutionary, notonly inthetechnical
fieldbutforourwhole concept ofcivilization. Notonly
should wehave toregard alEfurther technical progress as
acalamity; weshould have toregard allpast technical
progress with equal horror. Every dayeach ofusinhis
own capacity isengaged intrying toreduce theeffort it
requires toaccomplish agiven result. Each ofusistrying
tosave hisown labor, toeconomize themeans required to
achieve hisends. Every employer, small aswell aslarge,
seeks constantly togain hisresults more economically and
efficiently—that is,bysaving labor. Every intelligent work-
man tries tocutdown theeffort necessary toaccomplish his
assigned job.Themost ambitious ofustrytirelessly toin-
crease theresults wecanachieve inagiven number of

nuity asnotonly useless butvicious, Wliy should freight
becarried fromNewYork toChicago byrailroads when
wecould employ enormously more men, forexample, to
carry itallontheir backs?
Theories asfalse asthisarenever heldwith logical con-
sistency, buttheydogreatharm because they areheld at
all.Letus,therefore, trytoseeexactly whathappens when
technical improvements andlabor-saving machinery arein-
troduced. The details willvary ineach instance, depend-
ingupon theparticular conditions that prevail inagiven
industry orperiod. Butweshallassume anexample that
involves themain possibilities.
Suppose aclothing manufacturer learns ofamachine
that willmakemen sandwomen sovercoats forhalf as
much labor aspreviously. He installs themachines and
drops half hislabor force.
This looks atfirstglance likeaclear lossofemployment.
Butthemachine itself required labor tomake it;sohere,
asone oflFset, arejobsthatwould nototherwise have existed.
Themanufacturer, however, would have adopted thema-
chine only ifithad either made better suits forhalf as
much labor, orhadmade thesamekind ofsuits atasmaller
cost. Ifweassume the latter,wecannot assume thatthe
amount oflabor tomake themachines was asgreat in
terms ofpayrolls astheamount oflabor thattheclothing
manufacturer hopes tosave inthelongrunbyadopting
themachine; otherwise therewould havebeennoecon-
omy,andhewould nothaveadopted it.

I Sothere isstillanetlossofemployment toheaccounted
for.Butweshould atleastkeep inmind therealpossibility
; thateven the first effect oftheintroduction oflabor-saving
; machinery maybetoincrease employment onnetbalance;
because itisusually only inthelongrunthattheclothing
manufacturer expects tosavemoney byadopting thema-
chine; itmay take several years forthemachine to'pay
for itself/'
After themachine hasproduced economies sufficient to
offset itscost, theclothing manufacturer hasmore profits
than before. (We shallassume thathemerely sells his
coats forthesame price ashiscompetitors, andmakes no
effort toundersell them.) Atthispoint, itmayseem, labor
hassuffered anetlossofemployment, while itisonlythe
manufacturer, the capitalist, whohasgained. But itis
precisely outofthese extra profits thatthesubsequent so-
cialgains must come.Themanufacturer must usethese
extra profits inatleastoneofthree ways, andpossibly he
willusepartofthem inallthree: (i)hewillusetheextra
profits toexpand hisoperations bybuying more machines
^tomakemore coats; or(2)hewillinvest theextra profits
insome other industry; or(3)hewillspend theextra
profits onincreasing hisownconsumption. Whichever of
these three courses hetakes, hewillincrease employment.
^ Inother words, themanufacturer, asaresult ofhis
economies, hasprofits thathedidnothave before. Every
dollar oftheamount hehassaved indirect wages tofor-
mercoatmakers, henowhastopayoutinindirect wages

Other capital industry, ortothemakers ofanewhouse or
motor carforhimself, orofjewelry andfurs forhiswife.
Inanycase(unless heisapointless hoarder) hegives in-
directly asmany jobs asheceased togive directly.
Butthematter doesnotandcannot restatthisstage. If
thisenterprising manufacturer effects great economies as
compared with hiscompetitors, either hewillbegin to
expand hisoperations attheir expense, orthey will start
buying themachines too.Again morework willbegiven
tothemakers ofthemachines. Butcompetition andpro-
duction willthen alsobegin toforcedown theprice of
overcoats. There willnolonger beasgreat profits forthose
wh6adopt thenewmachines. The rateofprofit ofthe
manufacturers using thenewmachine willbegin todrop,
while themanufacturers whohave stillnotadopted the
machine maynowmake noprofit atall.The savings, in
other words, willbegin tobepassed along tothebuyers of
overcoats— tothe
Butasovercoats arenow cheaper, more people willbuy
them. Thismeans that,though ittakes fewer people to
make thesamenumber ofovercoats asbefore, more over-
coats arenowbeingmade than before. Ifthedemand for
overcoats iswhat economists call “elastic^^—that is,ifafall
intheprice ofovercoats causes alarger totalamount of
money tobespent onovercoats than previously—^then
more people mayBeemployed even inmaking overcoats
than before thenew labor-saving machine wasintroduced.
Wehave already seenhow thisactually happened histor-
ically with stockings andother textiles.
THECURSE OEMACHINERY
Butthenewemployment doesnotdepend ontheelas-
ticity ofdemand fortheparticular product involved. Sup-
pose that,though theprice ofovercoats wasalmost cutin
half—from aformer price, say,of$50 toanew price of
$30—notasingle additional coatwas sold.The result
would bethatwhile consumers were aswellprovided with
newovercoats asbefore, eachbuyer would nowhave$20
leftover thathewould nothavehad leftover before.He
will therefore spend this$20forsomething else,andso
provide increased employment inother lines.
Inbrief,onnetbalance machines, technological improve-
ments, economies andefficiency donotthrowmenoutof
work.
Not allinventions anddiscoveries, ofcourse, are^labor-
saving” machines. Some ofthem, like precision instru-
ments, likenylon, Incite, plywood andplastics ofallkinds,
simply improve thequality ofproducts. Others, likethe
telephone ortheairplane, perform operations that direct
human labor could notperform atall. Still others bring
intoexistence objects and services, such asX-rays, radios
andsynthetic rubber, thatwould otherwise noteven exist.
Butintheforegoing illustration wehave taken precisely
thekind ofmachine thathasbeen thespecial object of
modem technophobia.
Itispossible, ofcourse, topiish toofartheargument
thatmachines donotonnetbalance throw men outof
work. Itissometimes argued, forexample, thatmachines
52 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
create more jobsthanwould otherwise have existed. Under
certain conditions thismaybetrue.They cancertainly
create enormously more jobs inforticular trades. The
eighteenth century figures forthetextile industries area
caseinpoint. Theirmodem counterparts arecertainly no
less striking. In1910, 140,000 persons wereemployed in
theUnited States inthenewly created automobile indus-
try.In1920, astheproduct wasimproved and itscost re-
duced, theindustry employed 250,000. In1930, asthis
product improvement and costreduction continued, em-
ployment intheindustry was380,000. In1940 ithad
risen to450,000. By1940, 35,000 people wereemployed
inmaking electric refrigerators, and60,000 were inthe
radio industry. Soithasbeen inonenewly created trade
after another, astheinvention wasimproved andthecost
reduced.
There isalsoanabsolute sense inwhich machines may
besaid tohaveenormously increased thenumber ofjobs.
Thepopulation oftheworld today isthree times asgreat
asinthemiddle oftheeighteenth century, before theIn-
dustrial Revolution had gotwellunder way.Machines
maybesaid tohave given birth tothisincreased popula-
tion; forwithout themachines, theworld would nothave
been able tosupport it.Two outofevery three ofus,there-
fore,maybesaid toowenotonlyourjobsbutourvery

Yet itisamisconception tothink ofthefunction or

ordevelopment inthelongrunandonthewhole com-

viewandthebroad view, theysometimes neglected totake
alsotheshort viewandthenarrow view.They were too
often inclined tominimize ortoforget altogether theim-
mediate effects ofdevelopments onspecial groups.We
have seen, forexample, thattheEnglish stocking knitters
suffered realtragedies asaresult oftheintroduction ofthe
new stocking frames, oneoftheearliest inventions ofthe
Industrial Revolution.
Butsuch factsand theirmodem counterparts have led
some writers totheopposite extreme oflooking only atthe

thatweshould trytoseeallthemain, consequences ofany

CHAPTERVIII
SPREAD-TH E-WORK SCHEMES
IHAVE referred tovarious union make-work andfeather-
bed practices. These practices, andthepublic tolera-
tionofthem, spring from thesamefundamental fallacy as
thefearofmachines. This isthebelief thatamore eflScient
wayofdoing athing destroys jobs,and itsnecessary corol-
larythatalessefficient wayofdoing itcreates them.
Allied tothis fallacy isthebelief that there isjusta
fixedamount ofwork tobedone intheworld, and that,
ifwecannot addtothisworkbythinking upmorecum-
bersome ways ofdoing it,atleastwecanthink ofdevices
forspreading itaround among aslarge anumber ofpeople
aspossible.
This error liesbehind theminute subdivision oflabor
upon which unions insist. Inthebuilding trades inlarge
cities thesubdivision isnotorious. Bricklayers arenot al-
lowed tousestones forachimney; that isthespecial work
ofstonemasons. Anelectrician cannot ripoutaboard to
fixaconnection andput itback again: that isthespecial
job,nomatterhowsimple itmay be,ofthecarpenters. A
plumber willnotremove orputback atileincident tofix-
ingaleak intheshower; that isthejobofatile-setter.
Furious "jurisdictional” strikes arefought among unions

fortheexclusive right todocertain types ofborderline
jobs. Inastatement recently prepared bytheAmerican
railroads fortheAttorney-General’s Committee onAd-
ministrative Procedure, theroads gave innumerable ex-
amples inwhich theNational Railroad Adjustment Board
haddecided that“each separate operation ontherailroad,
nomatter how minute, such astalking overatelephone
orspiking orunspiking aswitch, issofaranexclusive prop-
ertyofaparticular class ofemploye that ifanemploye of
another class, inthecourse ofhisregular duties, performs
such operations hemust notonlybepaidanextra day’s
wages fordoing so,butatthesame time thefurloughed
orunemployed members oftheclass held tobeentitled
toperform theoperation must bepaid aday’swages for
nothaving been called upon toperform it.”
Itistruethatafewpersons canprofit attheexpense of
therestofusfrom thisminute arbitrary subdivision of
'labor—^provided ithappens intheir case alone. Butthose
whosupport itasageneral practice failtoseethat italways
raises production costs; that itresults onnetbalance in
lessworkdoneandinfewer goods produced. Thehouse-
holder who isforced toemploy twomen todothework

Buthehasjustthatmuch lessmoney leftover tospend

Thehouseholder, however, isworse off.Instead ofhaving
arepaired shower andasweater, hehastheshower and
nosweater. And ifwecount thesweater aspartofthe
national wealth, thecountry isshort one sweater. This
symbolizes thenetresult oftheeffort tomake extrawork
byarbitrary subdivision oflabor.
Butthere areother schemes for'spreading thework,^'
often putforward byunion spokesmen and legislators. The
most frequent ofthese istheproposal toshorten thework-
ingweek, usually bylaw.The belief that itwould "spread
theworF^ and "give more jobs^^ wasoneofthemain
reasons behind theinclusion ofthepenalty-overtime pro-
vision intheexisting Federal Wage-Hour Law.The pre-
vious legislation intheStates, forbidding theemployment
ofwomen orminors formore, say,than forty-eight hours
aweek, wasbased ontheconviction thatlonger hours were
injurious tohealth andmorale. Some ofitwasbased on"^
thebelief thatlonger hours wereharmful toefficiency. But
theprovision intheFederal law, thatanemployer must
payaworker a50percentpremium above hisregular
hourly late ofwages for allhours worked inanyweek
above forty, wasnotbased primarily onthebelief that
forty-five hours aweek, say,wasinjurious either tohealth
orefficiency. Itwasinserted partly inthehope ofboosting
theworker sweekly income, andpartly inthehope that,
bydiscouraging theemployer from taking onanyone reg-
ularly formore than forty hours aweek, itwould force
him toemploy additional workers instead. Atthetime of
SPREAD-THE-WORK SCHEMES 59
writing^^ A^^ aremany schemes for"averting rmem-
ployment^* byenacting athirty-hour week.W istheactual effect ofsuch plans, whether en-
forced byindividual unions orbylegislation? Itwillclarify
theproblem ifweconsider two cases*The first isareduc-
tion inthestandard working week from forty hours to
thirty without anychange inthehourly rateofpay.The
second isareduction intheworking week from forty
hours tothirty, butwith asuflScient increase inhourly
wage rates tomaintain thesame weekly payforthein-
dividual workers already employed.
Letustakethe first case.Weassume thattheworking
week iscutfrom forty hours tothirty, withnochange in
hourly pay. Ifthere issubstantial unemployment when
thisplan isputinto effect, theplan willnodoubt provide
additional jobs.Wecannot assume that itwillprovide
sufl&cient additional jobs, however, tomaintain thesame
payrolls andthesamenumber ofman-hours asbefore,
unlesswemake theunlikely assumptions that ineach in-
dustry there hasbeen exactly thesame percentage ofun-
employment andthatthenewmenandwomen employed
arenoless efficient attheir special tasksontheaverage
than thosewhohadalready been employed. Butsuppose
wedomake these assumptions. Suppose wedoassume that
therightnumber of"additional workers ofeach skill is
available, andthatthenewworkers donotraise produc-
tion costs.What willbetheresult ofreducing thework-
ingweekfrom fortyhours tothirty (without anyincrease in
hourly pay)?
V
6o ECONOMICS INONELESSON
Though more workers willbeemployed, each willbe
working fewer hours, andthere will, therefore, benonet
increase inman-hours. Itisunlikely that there willbe
anysignificant increase inproduction. Total payrolls and
"purchasing power” willbenolarger. Allthat willhave
happened, even under themost favorable assiunptions
(which would seldom berealized) isthattheworkers pre-
viously employed will subsidize, ineffect, theworkers
previously unemployed. Forinorder thatthenewwork-
erswillindividually receive three-fourths asmany dollars
aweek astheoldworkers used toreceive, theoldworkers
willthemselves nowindividually receive only three-fourths
asmany dollars aweek aspreviously. Itistruethattheold
workers willnowwork fewer hours; but thispurchase of
more leisure atahigh price ispresumably notadecision
theyhavemade foritsown sake: itisasacrifice made to
provide others vwth jobs.
The labor union leaders whodemand shorter weeks to
"spread thework” usually recognize this,and therefore
theyputtheproposal forward inaform inwhich everyone
issupposed toeathiscakeandhave ittoo.Reduce the
working week from forty hours tothirty, they tellus,to
provide more jobs; butcompensate fortheshorter week
byincreasing thehourly rateofpayby33^^ percent.The
workers employed, say,were previously getting anaverage
of$40aweek forfortyhours work; inorder thattheymay
stillget$40foronly thirty hours work, thehourly rateof
paymustbeadvanced toanaverage of$1.33^.
What would bethecon^uences ofsuch aplan?The
SPREAD-THE-WORK SCHEMES 6l
firstandmost obvious consequence would betoraise costs
ofproduction. Ifweassume thattheworkers, when previ-
ously employed forforty hours, were getting lessthan
thelevel ofproduction costs, prices and profits made pos-
sible, thentheycould have gotthehourly increase without
reducing thelength oftheworking week.They could, in
other words, haveworked thesamenumber ofhours and
gottheir totalweekly incomes increased hyone-third, in-
stead ofmerely getting, asthey areunder thenew thirty-
hour week, thesame weekly income asbefore. But if,
under theforty-hour week, theworkers were already get-
ting ashigh awage asthelevel ofproduction costsand
prices made possible Cand theveryunemployment they
aretrying tocuremaybeasign thattheywere already
getting evenmore than this), then theincrease inproduc-
tion costs asaresult ofthe33 percent increase in
hourly wage rates willbemuch greater than theexisting
state ofprices, production and costscanstand.
The result ofthehigher wage rate, therefore, willbea
much greater unemployment than before. The least effi-
cient firms willbethrown outofbusiness, andthe least
efficient workers willbethrown outofjobs. Production
willbereduced allaround the circle. Higher production
costsandscarcer supplies willtend toraise prices, sothat
workers canbuy lesswith thesame dollar wages; onthe
other hand, theincreased unemployment -willshrink de-
mand andhence tend tolower prices. What ultimately
happens totheprices ofgoods willdepend upon what
monetary policies arethen followed. But ifapolicy of
ECONOMICS INONELESSON
monetary inflation ispursued, toenable prices toriseso
that theincreased hourly wages canbepaid, this will
merely beadisguised wayofreducing realwage rates, so
that these will return, interms oftheamount ofgoods
theycanpurchase, tothesame realrateasbefore. The re-
sultwould thenbethesame asiftheworking weekhad
been reduced without anincrease inhourly wage rates.
And theresults ofthathave already been discussed.
Thespread-the-work schemes, inbrief, restonthesame
sortofillusion thatwehavebeen considering. Thepeople
whosupport suchschemes think only oftheemployment
theywould provide forparticular persons orgroups; they
donotstop toconsider what theirwhole effect would be
oneverybody.
The spread-the-work schemes rest also, aswebegan by
pointing out,onthefalseassumption that there isjusta
fixedamount ofwork tobedone. There could beno
greater fallacy. There isnolimit totheamount ofwork
tobedone aslong asanyhuman need orwish thatwork
could fillremains unsatisfied. Inamodern exchange econ-
omy, themostwork willbedonewhen prices, costsand
wages areinthebest relations toeach other.What these
relations areweshall later consider.

DISBANDING TROOPS AND
BUREAUCRATS
?HEN, after every great war, itisproposed tode-
mobilize thearmed forces, there isalways agreat
fearthatthere willnotbeenough jobsforthese forces and
thatinconsequence they willbeunemployed. Itistrue
that,when millions ofmen aresuddenly released, itmay
require time forprivate industry toreabsorb them—though
what hasbeen chiefly remarkable inthepasthasbeen
thespeed, rather than theslowness, withwhich thiswas
accomplished. The fears ofunemployment arise because
people look atonlyonesideoftheprocess.
They seesoldiers being turned looseonthelabor mar-
ket.Where isthe‘purchasing power” going tocome from
toemploy them? Ifweassume thatthepublic budget is
being balanced, theanswer issimple. Thegovernment will
cease tosupport the soldiers. Butthetaxpayers willbe
allowed toretain thefunds thatwere previously taken
fromthem inorder tosupport thesoldiers. And thetax-
payers willthenhave additional funds tobuy additional
goods. Civilian demand, inother words, willbeincreased,
and willgiveemployment totheadded labor force repre-
sented bythesoldiers.
63
ECONOMICS INONELESSON 64
Ifthesoldiers havebeen supported byanunbalanced
budget—that is,bygovernment borrowing andother forms
ofdeficit financing—thecase issomewhat difiFerent. But
that raises adifiFerent question: weshall consider theeffects
ofdeficit financing inalater chapter. Itisenough torecog-
nizethat deficit financing isirrelevant tothepoint thathas
justbeenmade; forifweassume thatthere isanyadvan-
tage inabudget deficit, then precisely thesame budget
deficit could bemaintained asbefore bysimply reducing
taxesbytheamount previously spent insupporting the
wartime army.
Butthedemobilization tvillnotleave useconomically
justwhere wewere before itstarted. The soldiers previ-
ously supported bycivilians willnotbecome merely civil-
ianssupported byother civilians. They willbecome self-
supporting civilians. Ifweassume thatthemenwhowould
otherwise havebeen retained inthearmed forces areno
longer needed fordefense, then their retention would have
been sheer waste. They would have been unproductive.
The taxpayers, inreturn forsupporting them, would have
gotnothing. Butnowthetaxpayers turn over thispartof
theirfunds tothem asfellow civilians inreturn forequiva-
lent goods orservices. Total national production, the
wealth ofeverybody, ishigher.

equivalent totheremuneration they receive. Yetwhenever
anyeffort ismade tocutdown thenumber ofunnecessary
officeholders thecry iscertain toberaised that thisaction
if'^deflationary. Would youremove the'purchasing
power^from these officials? Would youinjure theland-
lords andtradesmen whodepend onthat purchasing
power? Youaresimply cutting down"the national income''
andhelping tobring about orintensify adepression.
Once again thefallacy comes from looking attheeffects
ofthisaction onlyonthedismissed officeholders them-
selves andontheparticular tradesmen whodepend upon
them.Once again itisforgotten that, ifthese bureaucrats
arenotretained inoffice, thetaxpayers willbepermitted
tokeep themoney thatwasformerly taken fromthem for
thesupport ofthebureawrats. Once again itisforgotten
thatthetaxpayers' income andpurchasing power goup
byatleast asmuch astheincome andpurchasing power
oftheformer officeholders godown. Iftheparticular shop-
keepers whoformerly gotthebusiness ofthese bureaucrats
lose trade, other shopkeepers elsewhere gain atleast as
much. Washington islessprosperous, and can, perhaps,
support fewer stores; butother towns cansupport more.
Once again, however, thematter does notend there.
Thecountry isnotmerely aswell offwithout thesuper-
fluous officeholders asitwould havebeenhad itretained
them. Itismuch better off.Fortheofficeholders mustnow
seek private jobs orsetupprivate businesses. And the
added purchasing power ofthetaxpayers, aswenoted in
ECONOMICS INONELESSON 66
thecaseofthesoldiers, willencourage this.Buttheoffice
holders cantake private jobsonlybysupplying equivalent
services tothosewhoprovide thejobs—or,rather, tothe
customers oftheemployers whoprovide thejobs. Instead
ofbeing parasites, theybecome productive men and
women.
Imust insist again that inallthis Iamnottalking of
public officeholders whose services arereally needed. Nec-
essary policemen, firemen, street cleaners, health officers,
judges, legislators andexecutives perform productive serv-
icesasimportant asthose ofanyone inprivate industry.
Theymake itpossible forprivate industry tofunction in
anatmosphere oflaw, order, freedom andpeace. Buttheir
justification consists intheutility oftheir services. Itdoes
notconsist inthe"purchasing power ^they possess byvirtue
ofbeing onthepublic payroll,
Th "purchasing power 'argument is,when onecon-
siders itseriously, fantastic. Itcould just aswellapply to
aracketeer orathiefwho robsyou. After hetakes your
money hehasmore purchasing power.Hesupports with
itbars, restaurants, night clubs, tailors, perhaps automobile
workers. Butforevery jobhisspending provides, yourown
spending must provide one less,because youhave that
much lesstospend. Justsothetaxpayers provide one less
jobforevery jobsupplied bythespending ofofficeholders.
When yourmoney istaken byathief, yougetnothing in

THEFETISH OFFUELEMPLOYMENT
Theeconomic goalofanynation, asofanyindividual,
istogetthegreatest results with the least effort.
Thewhole economic progress ofmankind hasconsisted
ingetting more production with thesame labor. Itisfor
thisreason thatmenbegan putting* burdens onthebacks
ofmules instead ofontheirown; thattheywentonto
invent thewheel and thewagon, therailroad and the
motor truck. Itisforthisreason thatmenused their in-
genuity todevelop ahundred thousand labor-saving inven-
tions.
Allthis issoelementary thatonewould blush tostate
itifitwere notbeing constantly forgotten bythosewho
coinand circulate thenew slogans. Translated into na-
tional terms, this first principle means thatour realob-
jective istomaximize production. Indoing this, fullem-
ployment—that is,theabsence ofinvoluntary idleness—
becomes anecessary by-product. Butproduction istheend,
employment merely themeans.Wecannot continuously
have thefullest production without fullemployment. But
wecanvery easily have fullemployment without fullpro-.
duction.

Primitive tribes arenaked, andwretchedly fedand

andIndia areincomparably poorer than ourselves, butthe
main trouble fromwhich they suffer isprimitive produc-
tionmethods (which areboth acause andaconsequence
ofashortage ofcapital) andnotunemployment. Nothing
iseasier toachieve than fullemployment, once itisdi-
vorced from thegoaloffullproduction andtaken asan

hugearmament program. Thewarprovided fullemploy-
ij ment forevery nation involved. The slave labor inGer-
jmany had fullemployment. Prisons andchain gangs have

Yetour legislators donotpresent FullProduction bills

thatthere isonlyafixedamount ofwork tobedone, the

WHO’S ‘'PROTECTED” BY

AMERE recital oftheeconomic policies ofgovernments

^
student ofeconomics tothrow uphishands indespair,I
What possible point canthere be,heislikely toask, in,
^
discussing refinements andadvances ineconomic theory,
when popular thought andtheactual policies ofgovern-
ments, certainly ineverything connected with intemationaj
relations, have notyetcaught upwith.Adam Smith? Fof
present-day tariff, and trade policies arenotonly asbad
asthose intheseventeenth andeighteenth centuries, but
incomparably worse. The realreasons forthose tariffs and
other trade barriers arethesame, andthepretended reasons
arealsothesame.
Inthecentury andthree-quarters sinceTheWealth of
Nations appeared, thecase forfreetrade hasbeen stated
thousands oftimes, butperhaps never withmore direct
simplicity andforce than itwasstated inthatvolume. In
general Smith rested hiscaseononefundamental proposi-
tion: 'Inevery country italways isandmust betheinter-
estofthegreatbody ofthepeople tobuywhatever they
want ofthosewho sell itcheapest.’^ ^'The proposition isso

very manifest, Smith continued, "that itseems ridiculous
totakeanypains toprove it;norcould iteverhavebeen
called inquestion, hadnottheinterested sophistry ofmer-
chants andmanufacturers confounded thecommon-sense
ofmankind.”
From another point ofview, freetradewasconsidered
asoneaspect ofthespecialization oflabor:
Itisthemaxim ofevery prudent master ofafamily,
never toattempt tomake athome what itwillcostbirn
more tomake than tobuy.The tailor doesnotattempt
tomake hisown shoes, butbuysthem oftheshoe-
maker. Theshoemaker does notattempt tomake his
own clothes, butemploys atailor.Thefarmer attempts
tomake neither theonenortheother, butemploys those
diflFerent artificers. Allofthem find itfortheir interest
toemploy theirwhole industry inawayinwhich they
havesome advantage over their neighbors, and topur-
chase with apartofitsproduce, orwhat isthesam^
thing, with theprice ofapartofit,whatever elsethey
have occasion for.What isprudence intheconduct of
every private family canscarce befolly inthatofa
great Icingdom.
Butwhat ever ledpeople tosuppose thatwhat was
prudence intheconduct ofevery private family could be
folly inthatofagreatkingdom? Itwasawhole network
offallacies, outofwhich mankind hasstiHbeen unable
tocut itsway.And thechief ofthemwasthecentral fal-
lacywithwhich thisbook isconcerned. Itwas thatof
considering merely theimmediate ejSfects ofatariff on
who's PROTECTED BYTARIFFS? 73
special groups, andneglecting toconsider itslong-run ef"
fectsonthewhole community.
AnAmerican manufacturer ofwoolen sweaters goes to
Congress ortotheState Department and tellsthecom-
mittee orofEcials concerned that itwould beanational
disaster forthem toremove orreduce the tariffonBritish
sweaters. Henow sells hissweaters for$15 each, but
English manufacturers could sellheresweaters ofthesame
quality for$10.Aduty of$5,therefore, isneeded tokeep
himinbusiness. He isnotthinking ofhimself, ofcourse,
butofthethousand menandwomen heemploys, andof
thepeople towhom theirspending inturn gives employ-
ment.Throw them outofwork, andyoucreate unemploy-
mentandafallinpurchasing power, which would spread
inever-widening circles. And ifhecanprove thathereally
would beforced outofbusiness ifthetariffwereremoved
orreduced, hisargument against that action isregarded
byCongress asconclusive.
Butthefallacy comes from looking merely atthismanu-
facturer and hisemployes, ormerely attheAmerican
sweater industry. Itcomes from noticing only theresults
thatareimmediately seen,andneglecting theresults that
arenotseenbecause they areprevented fromcoming into
existence.
The lobbyists fortariff protection arecontinually put-
tingforward arguments thatarenotfactually correct. But
ECONOMICS INONEXESSON 74
letusassume thatthefacts inthiscaseareprecisely asthe
sweater manufacturer hasstated them. Letusassume that
atariff of$5asweater isnecessary forhim tostayinbusL
nessandprovide employment atsweater-making forhis
workers.
Wehave deliberately chosen themost unfavorable ex-
ample ofany fortheremoval ofatariff.Wehave not
taken anargument fortheimposition ofanew tariff in
order tobring anewindustry into existence^ butanargu-
ment fortheretention ofatariff thathasalready hrought
anindustry intoexistence^ andcannot berepealed without
hurting somebody.
The tariff isrepealed; themanufacturer goes outof
business; athousand workers arelaid off;theparticular
tradesmen whom theypatronized arehurt This istheim-
mediate result that isseen. But there arealso results
which, whilemuch more difficult totrace, arenolessim-
mediate andnoless real.Fornow sweaters thatformerly
cost$15apiece canbebought for$10.Consumers can
nowbuythesame quality ofsweater forlessmoney, or
amuch better oneforthesame money. Iftheybuythe
same quality ofsweater, theynotonly getthesweater, but
they have $5left over, which theywould nothave
hadunder theprevious conditions, tobuysomething else.
With the$10thattheypayfortheimported sweater they
helpemployment— astheAmerican manufacturer no
doubt predicted—^inthesweater industry inEngland. With
the$5leftovertheyhelpemployment inanynumber of
other industries intheUnited States.^
Buttheresults donotend there. Bybuying English
who's proitegted byTABIFFS? 75
sweaters they fumisli theEnglish with dollars tobuy
American goods here. This, infact (ifImayhere disre-
gardsuch complications asmultilateral exchange, loans,
credits, goldmovements, etc,which donot alter theend
result} istheonlyway inwhich theBritish caneventually
make useofthese dollars. Because wehave permitted the
British tosellmore tous,they arenow able tobuymore
from us.They are,infact, eventually forced tobuymore
fromusiftheir dollar balances arenottoremain perpetu-
allyunused. So,asaresult ofletting inmore British goods,
wemust export moreAmerican goods.Andthough fewer
people arenowemployed intheAmerican sweater in-
dustry, more people areemployed—^andmuch more efS-
ciently employed— in,say,theAmerican automobile or
washing-machine business. American employment onnet
balance hasnotgone down, butAmerican and British
production onnetbalance hasgone up.Labor ineach
country ismore fullyemployed indoing justthose things
that itdoes best, instead ofbeing forced todothings that
itdoes inefficiently orbadly. Consumers inboth countries
arebetter off.They areable tobuywhat theywantwhere
theycanget itcheapest. American consumers arebetter
provided with sweaters, and British consumers arebetter
provided withmotor carsandwashing machines.
Now letuslook atthematter theotherwayround, and
seetheeffect ofimposing atariff inthe firstplace. Suppose
thattherehadbeennotariffonforeign knit goods, that
76 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
Americans were accustomed tobuying foreign sweaters
without duty, andthattheargument were thenput for-
ward thatwecould bring asweater industry intoexistence
byimposing aduty of$5onsweaters.
There would benothing logically wrong with this ar-
gument sofarasitwent.The costofBritish sweaters to
theAmerican consumer might thereby beforced sohigh
thatAmerican manufacturers would find itprofitable to
enter thesweater business. ButAmerican consumers would
beforced tosubsidize thisindustry. Onevery American
sweater theybought theywould beforced ineffect topay
ataxof$5which would becollected fromthem ina
higher pricebythenewsweater industry,
Americans would beemployed inasweater industry who
hadnotpreviously beenemployed inasweater industry.
Thatmuch istrue.Buttherewould benonetaddition to
thecountry’s industry orthecountry’s employment. Be-
cause theAmerican consumer had topay$5more forthe
same quality ofsweater hewould have just thatmuch
less leftover tobuyanything else.Hewould have tore-
duce hisexpenditures by$3somewhere else.Inorder that
oneindustry might grow orcome intoexistence, ahundred
other industries would have toshrink. Inorder that20,000
persons might beemployed inasweater industry, 20,000
fewer persons would beemployed elsewhere.
Butthenewindustry would bevisible. Thenumber of
itsemployes, thecapital invested init,themarket value
ofitsproduct interms ofdollars, could beeasily counted.
Theneighbors could seethesweater workers going toand
f^
who's protected bytariffs? 77
from thefactory every day.The results would bepalpable
and direct. Buttheshrinkage ofahundred other indus-
tries, thelossof20,000 other jobssomewhere else,would
notbesoeasily noticed. Itwould beimpossible foreven
thecleverest statistician toknow precisely what theinci-
dence ofthelossofother jobshadbeen—^precisely how
manymenandwomen hadbeen laid offfrom each par-
ticular industry, precisely howmuch business each par-
ticular industry hadlost— because consumers had topay
more fortheir sweaters. Foralossspread among allthe
other productive activities ofthecountry would becom-
paratively minute foreach. Itwould beimpossible for
anyone toknow precisely howeachconsumer would have
spent hisextra$5ifhehadbeen allowed toretain it.The
overwhelming majority ofthepeople, therefore, would
i probably suffer from theoptical illusion thatthenew in-
! dustry hadcostusnothing.
Itisimportant tonotice thatthenew tariffonsweaters
would notraiseAmerican wages.Tobesure, itwould en-
ableAmericans towork inthesweater industry atapproxi-
mately theaverage level ofAmerican wages (forworkers
oftheir skill), instead ofhaving tocompete inthatindustry
attheBritish level ofwages. Buttherewould benoin-
crease ofAmerican wages ingenercd asaresult oftheduty;
for,aswehave seen, therewould benonetincrease inthe
number ofjobsprovided, nonetincrease inthedemand for
goods, andnoincrease inlalx>r productivity. Labor produc-
tivity would, infact,beredticed asaresult ofthe tarijff.
And thisbrings ustothereal effect ofatariffwall It
isnotmerely that all itsvisible gains areoffset byless
obvious butnolessreal losses. Itresults, infact, inanet
losstothecountry. Forcontrary tocenturies ofinterested
propaganda anddisinterested confusion, the tariff reduces
theAmerican level ofwages.
Letusobserve more clearly how itdoes this.Wehave
seen thattheadded amount which consumers pay fora
tariff-protected article leaves them justthatmuch lesswith
which tobuy allother articles. There isherenonetgain
toindustry asawhole. Butasaresult ofthe artificial bar-
riererected against foreign goods, American labor, capital
andland aredeflected fromwhat theycandomore effi-
ciendy towhat theydoless efficiently. Therefore, asa
result ofthetariff wall, theaverage productivity ofAuner-
icanlaborandcapital isreduced.
Ifwelook atitnowfrom theconsumer’s point ofview,
wefind thathe.canbuy lesswith hismoney. Because he
hastopaymore forsweaters andother protected goods, he
canbuy lessofeverything else.The general purchasing
power ofhisincome hastherefore been reduced. Whether

Fortheerection oftariff walls hasthesame effect asthe

The tariff hasbeen described asameans ofbenefiting
theproducer attheexpense of,theconsumer. Inasense
this iscorrect. Thosewho favor itthink only oftheinter-
estsoftheproducers immediately benefited bythepar-
ticular duties involved. They forget theinterests ofthe
consumers who areimmediately injured bybeing forced
topaythese duties. But itiswrong tothink ofthe tariff
issue asifitrepresented aconflict between theinterests
ofproducers asaunitagainst those ofconsumers asaunit.
Itistruethatthe tariff hurts allconsumers assuch. Itis
nottrue that itbenefits allproducers assuch.Onthecon-
trary, aswehave justseen, ithelps theprotected producers
attheexpense ofallother American producers, andpar-
ticularly ofthosewhohaveacomparatively large potentud
export market.
^Vecanperhaps make this lastpoint clearer byanex-
aggerated example. Suppose wemake our tariffwaU so
high that itbecomes absolutely prohibitive, andnoim-
portscome infrom theoutside world atall.Suppose, as
aresult ofthis, thattheprice ofsweaters inAmerica goes
uponly $5.Then American consumers, because theyhave
topay$5niore forasweater, willspend ontheaverage five
who's PROTECTED BYTARIFFS? 8l
cents lessineach ofahundred otherAmerican industries.
(The figures arechosen merely toillustrate aprinciple:
there will, ofcourse, benosuch symmetrical distribution
oftheloss;moreover, thesweater industry itself willdoubt-
lessbehurtbecause ofprotection ofstillother industries.
Butthese complications maybeputaside forthemoment.)
Now because foreign industries will find theirmarket
inAmerica totally cutoff,they willgetnodollar exchange,
andtherefore they willbeunahle tohuyanyAmerican
goods atall.Asaresult ofthis,American industries will
f sujEfer indirect proportion tothepercentage oftheir sales
previously made abroad. Those that willbemost injured,
inthe firstinstance, willbesuch industries asrawcotton
producers, copper producers, makers ofsewing machines,
agricultural machinery, typewriters andsoon.
Ahigher tariff wall, which, however, isnotprohibitive,
willproduce thesame kind ofresults asthis,butmerely
toasmaller degree.
The effect ofatariff, therefore, istochange thestructure
ofAmerican production. Itchanges thenumber ofoccu-
pations, thekind ofoccupations, andtherelative sizeof
oneindustry ascompared with another. Itmakes thein-
dustries inwhich wearecomparatively inefficient larger,
andtheindustries inwhichwearecomparatively efficient
smaller. Itsnet effect, therefore, istoreduce American
efficiency, aswell astoreduce efficiency inthecountries
withwhichwewould otherwise have traded more largely.
Inthelong run,notwithstanding themountains ofargu-
ment proandcon, atariff isirrelevant tothequestion of1
82 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
employment. CTrue, sudden changes inthe tariff, either
upward ordownward, can create temporary unemploy-
ment, asthey force corresponding changes inthestructure
ofproduction. Such sudden changes caneven cause ade-
pression.) Butatariff isnotirrelevant tothequestion of
wages. Inthelongrun italways reduces realwages, be-
cause itreduces efficiency, production andwealth.
Thus allthechief tariff fallacies stemfrom therpnfrql
fallacy withwhich thisbook isconcerned. They arethe
result oflooking only attheimmediate effects ofasingle
tariff rateononegroup ofproducers, andforgetting
long-run effects bothonconsumers asawhole andonall
other producers.
(Ihearsome reader asking: ‘Why notsolve thisby
giving tariff protection toallproducers?” Butthefallacy
here isthat thiscannot helpproducers uniformly, andcan-
nothelp atalldomestic producers who already “outselT
foreign producers: these efficient producers must neces-
sarily suffer from the diversion ofpurchasing power
brought aboutbythe tariff.)
Onthesubject ofthe tariffwemust keep inmind one
final precaution. Itisthesame precaution thatwefound
inexamining the effects ofmachinery. Itis
useless todeny thatatariff does benefit—oratleastcan
benefit s'pedd interests. True, itbenefits them atthe
expense ofeveryqne else.But itdoes benefit them. Ifone
:ction, while itsowners and
WHO^S PROTECTED BYTARIFFS? 83
workers enjoyed thebenefits offreetrade ineverything else
theybought, thatindustry would benefit, evenonnetbal-
ance.Asanattempt ismade toextend the tarijff blessings,
however, even people intheprotected industries, both as
Iproducers andconsumers, begin tosuiEFer from other peopIe^s
protection, andmay finally beworse offevenonnetbalance
than ifneither theynoranybody elsehadprotection.
I Butweshould notdeny, asenthusiastic free traders
have sooften done, thepossibility ofthese tariff benefits to
special groups.Weshould notpretend, forexample, thata
reduction ofthe tariffwould help everybody andhurt
nobody. Itistruethat itsreduction would help thecountry
onnetbalance. Butsomebody would behurt. Groups
previously enjoying high protection would behurt.That in
fact isonereasonwhy itisnotgood tobring such protected
.interests into existence inthe first place. But clarity and
candor ofthinking compel ustoseeandacknowledge that
I some industries arerightwhen they saythataremoval of
; the tarijffontheir product would throw them outofbusi-
Inessandthrow their workers (atleast temporarily) outof
i jobs.And iftheirworkers have developed specialized skills,
theymayeven suffer permanently, oruntil theyhave at
long lastlearnt equal skills. Intracing theeffects oftariffs,
• asintracing theeffects ofmachinery, weshould endeavor
Itoseeallthechief eflFects, inboth theshort runandthe

“protects theAmerican standard ofliving.” Itdoesnone
ofthese things; andsofaraswages andthestandard of

examination ofduties imposed forother purposes would
carry usbeyond ourpresent subject.
Norneedwehereexamine theeffect ofimport quotas,
exchange controls, bilateralism andother devices inreduc-
ing, diverting orpreventing international trade. Such
devices have, ingeneral, thesame effects ashigh orpro-
hibitive tariffs, andoften worse effects. They present more
complicated issues, but their net results canhetraced
through thesame kind ofreasoning thatwehave just
applied totariff harriers.

j,
Exceeded onlybythepathological dread ofimports
'that affects allnations isapathological yearning for
exports. Logically, itistrue,nothing could bemore incon-
sistent, Inthelongrunimports andexports must equal
each other (considering both inthebroadest sense, which
includes such 'mvisible” items astourist expenditures and
ocean freight charges). Itisexports thatpayforimports,
andvice versa.The greater exports wehave, thegreater
imports wemust have, ifweeverexpect togetpaid.The
'smaller imports wehave, thesmaller exports wecanhave.
Without imports wecanhavenoexports, forforeigners
willhavenofunds withwhich tobuyourgoods.When we
decide tocutdown ourimports, weareineffect deciding
alsotocutdown ourexports. When wedecide toincrease
ourexports, weareineflFect deciding also toincrease our
imports.
Thereason forthis iselementary. AnAmerican exporter
sells hisgoods toaBritish importer and ispaid inBritish
pounds sterling. Buthecannot useBritish pounds topay
thewages ofhisworkers, tobuy hiswife's clothes orto
buytheater tickets. For allthese purposes heneeds Amer-
ican dollars. Therefore hisBritish pounds areofnouse
86 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
tohimunless heeither usesthem himself tobuy British
goods orsellsthem tosomeAmerican importer whowishes
tousethem tobuy British goods. Whichever hedoes, the
transaction cannot becompleted until theAmerican exports
havebeen paid forbyanequalamount ofimports.
Thesame situation would exist ifthetransaction bad
been conducted interms ofAmerican dollars instead of
British pounds. The British importer could notpaythe
American exporter indollars unless some previous British
exporter had builtupacredit indollars here asaresult
ofsome previous sale tous.Foreign exchange, inshort,
isaclearing transaction inwhich, inAmerica, thedollar
debts offoreigners arecancelled against their dollar credits.
InEngland, thepound sterling debts offoreigners are
cancelled against their sterling credits.
There isnoreason togointothetechnical details ofall
this,which canbefound inanygood textbook onforeign
exchange. But itshould bepointed outthatthere isnothing
inherently mysterious about it(inspite ofthemystery in
which itissooften wrapped), andthat itdoesnotdiffer
essentially fromwhat happens indomestic trade. Each of
usmust also sellsomething, even ifformost ofusitisour
own services rather than goods, inorder togetthepurchas-
ingpower tobuy.Domestic trade isalsoconducted inthe
mainbycrossing oflfchecks andother claims against each
other through clearing houses.
Itistrue thatunder aninternational goldstandard dis-
crepancies inbalances ofimports andexports aresometimes
setded byshipments ofgold.Buttheycould justaswell

that isanother story.)
Now thesame people who canbeclearheaded and
sensible when thesubject isoneofdomestic trade canbe
incredibly emotional andmuddleheaded when itbecomes
oneofforeign trade. Inthelatter fieldtheycanseriously
advocate oracquiesce inprinciples which theywould think
itinsane toapply indomestic business. Atypical example
isthebelief thatthegovernment should make huge loans
toforeign countries forthesakeofincreasing ourexports,
regardless ofwhether ornotthese loans arelikely tobe
repaid.
American citizens, ofcourse, should beallowed tolend
theirownfunds abroad attheirown risk.Thegovernment
should putnoarbitrary barriers intheway ofprivate
lending tocountries withwhichweareatpeace.Weshould
givegenerously, forhumane reasons alone, topeoples who
areingreat distress orindanger ofstarving. Butweought
always toknow clearly whatwearedoing. Itisnotwise to
bestow charity onforeign peoples under theimpression that
88 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
one ismaking ahardheaded business transaction purely
forone’sown selfish purposes. That could only lead to
misunderstandings andhadrelations later.
Yetamong thearguments putforward infavor ofhuge
foreign lending one fallacy isalways sure tooccupy a
prominent place. Itruns like this.Even ifhalf(orall)the
loanswemake toforeign countries turn sourandarenot
repaid, thisnation will stillbebetter offforhaving made
them, because they willgiveanenormous impetus toour
exports.
Itshould beimmediately obvious that iftheloanswe
make toforeign countries toenable them tobuyourgoods
arenotrepaid, thenwearegiving thegoods away.A
nation cannot grow richbygiving goods away. Itcanonly
make itself poorer.
Noonedoubts thisproposition when itisapplied pri-
vately. Ifanautomobile company lends aman$r,ooo to
buya„car priced atthatamount, andtheloan isnotrepaid,
theautomobile company isnotbetter offbecause ithas
"sold” thecar. Ithassimply losttheamount that itcost
tomake thecar.IftheCarcost$900 tomake, andonly
half theloan isrepaid, then thecompany has lost$900
minus $500, oranetamount of$400. Ithasnotmadeup
intradewhat itlostinbadloans.
Ifthisproposition issosimple when applied toaprivate
companyi whydoapparently intelligent people getcon-
fused about itwhen applied toanation? The reason is
thatthetransaction must thenbetraced mentally through
afewmore stages. Onegroupmayindeed make gains—
while therestofustakethelosses.
THEDRIVE FOREXPORTS
Itistrue, forexample, thatpersons engaged exclusively
orchiefly inexport business might gainonnetbalance as
aresult ofbadloansmade abroad* Thenational lossonthe
transaction would becertain, but itmight bedistributed
inways difficult tofollow. The private lenders would take
their losses directly* The losses fromgovernment lending
would ultimately bepaid outofincreased taxes imposed
oneverybody. But there would alsobemany indirect
losses brought about bythe eflFect ontheeconomy ofthese
direct losses.
Inthelongrunbusiness andemployment inAmerica
would behurt, nothelped, byforeign loans thatwere not
repaid. Forevery extra dollar thatforeign buyers hadwith
which tobuyAmerican goods, domestic buyers would
ultimately haveonedollar less.Businesses thatdepend on
domestic tradewould therefore behurt inthelongrunas
much asexport businesses would behelped. Evenmany
concerns thatdidanexport business would behurtonnet
balance. American automobile companies, forexample, sold
about lopercent oftheir output intheforeign market
before thewar. Itwould notprofit them todouble their
salesabroad asaresult ofbadforeign loans iftheythereby
lost, say,20percent oftheirAmerican sales astheresult
ofadded taxes taken fromAmerican buyers tomake up
fortheunpaid foreign loans.
None ofthismeans, Irepeat, that itisunwise tomake
foreign loans, butsimply thatwecannot getrichbymaking
badones.
Forthesame reasons that itisstupid togive afalse
stimulation toexport tradebymaldng badloans oroutright
9° ECONOMICS INONELESSON
gifts toforeign countries, itisstupid togiveafalse stimu-
lation toexport trade through export sutedies. Rather
than repeat most oftheprevious argument, Ileave itto
thereader totrace theeffects ofexport subsidies asIhave
traced theeffects ofbadloans.Anexport subsidy isaelpar
case ofgiving theforeigner something fornothing, by
selling himgoods forlessthan itcostsustomake them. Itis
another caseoftrying togetrichbygiving things a'way.
Badloansandexport subsidies areadditional examples
oftheerror oflooking only attheimmediate effect ofa
policy onspecial groups, andofnothaving thepatience
orintelligence totrace thelong-run effects ofthepolicy

^TARITY^^ PRICES
SPECIAL interests, asthehistory oftariflFs reminds us,
canthink ofthemost ingenious reasons why they
should bethe.objects ofspecial solicitude. Their spokes-
men present aplan intheir favor; and itseems at
firstsoabsurd that disinterested writers donottrouble to
expose it.Butthespecial interests keeponinsisting onthe
scheme. Itsenactment would make somuch difference to
theirownimmediate welfare thattheycanafford tohire
trained economists and^public relations experts” topropa-
gate itintheir behalf. Thepublic hears theargument so
often repeated, andaccompanied bysuch awealth of
imposing statistics, charts, curves and pie-slices, that itis
soontaken in.When atlastdisinterested writers recognize
thatthedanger oftheschemers enactment isreal, they
areusually toolate.They cannot inafewweeks acquaint
themselves vnth thesubject asthoroughly asthehired
brainswhohave been devoting their fulltime toitfor
years; theyareaccused ofbeing uninformed, andtheyhave
theairofmenwhopresume todispute axioms.
This general history willdoasahistory oftheidea of
^parity” prices foragricultural products, Iforget the first
daywhen itmade itsappearance inalegislative bill;but
91.
92. ECONOMICS INONELESSON
with theadvent oftheNewDeal in1933hhadbecome a
definitely established principle, enacted into law;and as
yearsucceeded year,and itsabsurd corollaries made them-
selves manifest, theywere enacted too.
Theargument for“parity” prices ranroughly like this.
Agriculture isthemost basicandimportant ofallindus-
tries. Itmust bepreserved atallcosts. Moreover, the
prosperity ofeverybody elsedepends upon theprosperity
ofthefarmer. Ifhedoesnothave thepurchasing power
tobuytheproducts ofindustry, industry languishes. This
wasthecause, ofthe1929 collapse, oratleastofourfailure
torecover from it.Fortheprices offarm products dropped
violently, while theprices ofindustrial products dropped
tery little.The result wasthatthefarmer could notbuy
industrial products; thecityworkers were laid o£Fand
could notbuyfarm products, andthedepression spread in
ever-widening vicious circles. There wasonlyone cure,
and itwassimple. Bring back theprices ofthefarmers
products toaparity” with theprices ofthethings the
farmer buys. This parity existed intheperiod from1909 to
1914,when farmers were prosperous. That price relation-
shipmustberestored andpreserved perpetually.
Itwould take toolong,andcarry ustoofarfrom our
main point, toexamine every absurdity concealed intbi.;
plausible statement. There isnosound reason fortaking
theparticular price relationships thatprevailed inapar-
ticular year orperiod andregarding them assacrosanct, or
even asnecessarily more "normal” than those ofanyother
period. Even iftheywere “normal” atthetime, what
1
"parity” prices 93
reason isdiere tosuppose that these same relationships
should bepreserved ageneration later inspite oftheenor-
mous changes intheconditions ofproduction anddemand
thathave taken place inthemeantime? The period of
1909 to1914, asthebasis of“parity,” wasnotselected at
random. Interms ofrelative prices itwasoneofthemost
favorable periods toagriculture inourentire history.
Iftherehadbeenanysincerity orlogic intheidea, it
would havebeen universally extended. Iftheprice relation-
ships between agricultural and industrial products that
prevailed from August, 1909 toJuly, 1914 ought tobe
preserved perpetually, why notpreserve perpetually the
price relationship ofeverycommodity atthattime toevery
other?AChevrolet six-cylinder touring carcost$2,150 in
1912; anincomparably improved six-cylinder Chevrolet
sedan cost$907 in1942: adjusted for“parity” onthesame
basis asfarm products, however, itwould have cost$3,270
in1942.Apound ofaluminum from1909 to1913 inclusive
averaged 22 cents; itsprice early in1946was14cents;
butat“parity” itwould thenhave cost, instead, 41cents.
Ihearimmediate cries thatsuchcomparisons areabsurd,
because everybody knows notonly that thepresent-day
automobile isincomparably superior ineveryway tothe
carof1912, butthat itcosts only afraction asmuch to
produce, and that thesame istrue alsoofaluminum.
Exactly. Butwhydoesn’t somebody saysomething about the
amazing increase inproductivity peracreinagriculture? In
thefive-year period 1939 to1943anaverage of260pounds
ofcotton wasraised peracreintheUnited States ascom-’f
ECONOMICS INONELESSON 94
pared withanaverage of188pounds inthefive-year period
1909 to1913. Costs ofproduction havebeen substantially
lowered forfarmproducts bybetter applications ofchemical
fertilizer, improved strains ofseedandincreasing mechani-
zation—^bythegasoline tractor, thecorn busker, thecotton
picker. some large farms which havebeen completely
mechanized andareoperated along massproduction lines, it
requires only one-third toone-fifth theamount oflabor to
produce thesame pelds asitdidafewyears back/^^ Yet
allthis isignored bytheapostles of/parity^^ prices*
The refusal touniversalize theprinciple isnottheonly
evidence that itisnotapublic-spirited economic planbut
merely adevice forsubsidizing aspecial interest. Another
evidence isthatwhen agricultural prices goabove ^parity/'
orareforced there bygovernment policies, there isno
demand onthepart ofthefarm bloc inCongress that
such prices bebrought dovm toparity, orthatthesubsidy
betothatextent repaid. Itisarule thatworks onlyone
way.
Dismissing allthese considerations, letusreturn tothe
central fallacy that specially concerns ushere. This isthe
argument that ifthefarmer getshigher prices forhis
products hecanbuymore goods from industry and so
make industry prosperous andbring fullemployment. It
doesnotmatter tothisargument, ofcourse, whether ornot
thefarmer gets specifically so-called 'parity*' prices.
^New YorkTimes, Jan. 2,1946.
“parity” prices 95
Everything, however, depends onhow these higher
prices arebrought about. Iftheyaretheresult ofageneral
revival, iftheyfollow from increased prosperity ofbusiness,
increased industrial production andincreased purchasing
power ofcityworkers Cnotbrought about byinflation),
then theycanindeed mean increased prosperity andpro-
duction notonly forthefanners, butforeveryone. But
whatwearediscussing isariseinfarm prices brought
about bygovernment intervention. This canbedone in
several ways.The higher price canbeforced bymere
edict,which istheleastworkable method. Itcanbebrought
about bythegovernment’s standing ready tobuy allthe
farm products oflFered toitatthe“parity” price. Itcan
bebrought about bythegovernment’s lending tofarmers
enough money ontheir crops toenable them tohold the
crops offthemarket until "parity” orahigher price is
realized. Itcanbebrought about bythegovernment's en-
forcing restrictions inthesizeofcrops. Itcanbebrought
about, asitoften isinpractice, byacombination ofthese
methods. Forthemoment weshallsimply assume that,by
whatever method, itisinanycasebrought about.
What istheresult? The farmers gethigher prices for
their crops. Their “purchasing power” isthereby increased.
They areforthetimebeing morepro^erous themselves,
andtheybuymore oftheproducts ofindustry. Allthis is
what isseenbythosewho lookmerely attheimmediate
consequences ofpolicies tothegroups directly involved.
But there isanother consequence, noless inevitable.
Suppose thewheat which would otherwise sellat$ia
ECONOMICS INONELESSON 96
bushel ispushed upbythispolicy to$1.50. Thefarmer
gets50cents abushel more forwheat. Butthecityworker,
byprecisely thesame change, fays50cents abushel more
forwheat inanincreased price ofbread. Thesame thing
istrueofanyotherfarm product. Ifthefarmer thenhas50
centsmore purchasing power tobuy industrial products,
thecityworker hasprecisely thatmuch lesspurchasing
power tobuyindustrial products. Onnetbalance industry
ingeneral hasgained nothing. Itloses incity sales pre-
cisely asmuch asitgains inrural sales.
There isofcourse achange intheincidence ofthese
sales.Nodoubt theagricultural-implement makers andthe
mail-order houses doabetter business. Butthecitydepart-
ment stores doasmaller business.
The matter, however, does notend here.The policy
results notmerely innonetgain, butinanet loss.For it
doesnotmean merely atransfer ofpurchasing power to
thefarmer from cityconsumers, orfrom thegeneral tax-
payer, orfrom both. Italsomeans aforced cutinthepro-
duction offarm commodities tobring uptheprice. This
means adestruction ofwealth. Itmeans thatthere isless
food tobeconsumed. How thisdestruction ofwealth is
brought about willdepend upon theparticular method
pursued tobring prices up.Itmaymean theactual physical
destruction ofwhat hasalready been produced, asinthe
burning ofcoffee inBrazil. Itmaymean aforced restriction
ofacreage, asintheAmerican AAA plan.Weshallexamine
theeffect ofsome ofthese methods whenwecome tothe,
broader discussion ofgovernment commodity controls.
PARITY PRICES 97
Buthere itmayhepointed outthatwhen thefarmer
reduces theproduction ofwheat toget^parity/* hemay
indeed getahigher price foreach bushel, butheproduces
and sellsfewer bushels. The result isthathisincome does
notgoupinproportion tohisprices. Even some ofthe
advocates of^parity prices^* recognize this,anduse itasan
argument togoontoinsist upon ^parity income^* for
farmers. But thiscanonlybeachieved byasubsidy atthe
direct expense oftaxpayers. Tohelp thefarmers, inother
words, itmerely reduces thepurchasing power ofcity
workers andother groups stillmore.
There isoneargument for^parity^^ prices thatshould
bedealtwith beforeweleave thesubject. Itisputforward
bysome ofthemore sophisticated defenders, 'Tes,”* they
will freely admit, ^^theeconomic arguments forparity
prices areunsound. Such prices areaspecial privilege. They
areanimposition ontheconsumer. But isn^tthe tariffan
imposition onthefarmer? Doesn^t hehave topayhigher
prices onindustrial products because ofit?Itwould dono
good toplace acompensating tariff onfarm products,
because America isanetexporter offarm products. Now
theparity-price system isthefarmer sequivalent ofthe
tariflF, Itistheonly fairway toeven things up.**
The farmers thatasked forparity prices didhave a
legitimate complaint. The protective tariff injured them
more than theyknew. Byreducing industrial imports it
98 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
alsoreduced American farm exports, because itprevented
foreign nations from getting thedollar exchange needed
fortaking ouragricultural products. And itprovoked retal-
iatory tariffs inother countries. None theless,theargument
wehave justquoted willnotstand examination. Itis’wrong
even initsimplied statement ofthe facts. There isno
general tariffonall^^industriaf^ products oronallnon-
farm products. There arescores ofdomestic industries orof
exporting industries thathavenotariff protection. Ifthe
cityworker hastopayahigher price forwoolen blankets
orovercoats because ofatariff, ishe^'compensated'' by
having topayahigher price also forcotton clothing and
forfoodstuffs? Or ishemerely being robbed twice?
Letuseven itall‘out, saysome, bygiving equal "pro-
tection" toeverybody. Butthat isinsoluble andimpossible.
Even ifweassume thattheproblem could besolved tech-
nically—atariff forA,anindustrialist subject toforeign
competition; asubsidy forB,anindustrialist who exports
hisproduct— ^itwould beimpossible toprotect orto
subsidize everybody "fairly" orequally.Weshould have
togiveeveryone thesame percentage (orwould itbethe
same dollar amount?) oftariff protection orsubsidy, and
wecould never besurewhenwewere duplicating pay-
ments tosome groups orleaving gapswith others.
Butsuppose wecould solve thisfantastic problem? What
would bethepoint?Who gainswhen everyone equally
subsidizes everyone else?What istheprofitwhen every-
one loses inadded taxes precisely what hegains byhis
subsidy orhisprotection? Weshould merely haveadded

anarmy ofneedless bureaucrats tocarry outdieprogram,
with allofthem losttoproduction.
Wecould solve thematter simply, ontheother hand,
byending both theparity-price system andtheprotective-
tariff system. Meanwhile theydonot,incombination, even
outanything. The joint system means merely thatFarmer
Aand Industrialist Bboth profit attheexpense ofFor-
gottenMan C.

CHAPTER XIV
SAVING THE XINDUSTRY
^U'^HE lobbies ofCongress arecrowded with representa-
JLtives oftheXindustry. TheXindustry issick.The
Xindustry isdying. Itmustbesaved. Itcanbesaved only
byatarijff, byhigher prices, orbyasubsidy. Ifitisallowed
todie,workers willbethrown onthe streets. Their land-
lords, grocers, butchers, clothing stores and local motion
picture theaters will lose business, and depression will
spread inever-widening circles. But iftheXindustry, by
prompt action ofCongress, issaved—ahthen! itwillbuy
equipment from other industries; moremen willbeem-
ployed; they willgivemore business tothebutchers, bakers
andneon-light makers, andthen itisprosperity that will
spread inever-widening circles.
Itisobvious that this ismerely ageneralized form of
thecasewehave justbeen considering. There theXin-
dustry was agriculture. Butthere areanendless number
ofXindustries. Two ofthemost notable examples inre-
cent years have been thecoaland silver industries. To
*'save silver^Congress didimmense harm.One oftheargu-
ments fortherescue planwas that itwould help *"Ae
East.^^ One ofitsactual results was tocause deflation in
China, which hadbeen onasilver basis, and toforce
lOO
SAVING THEXINDUSTRY lOI
China offthat basis.TheUnited States Treasury was
compelled toacquire, atridiculous prices farabove the
market level, hoards ofunnecessary silver, and tostore it
invaults. The essential political aims ofthe '^silver Sena-
tors’'could havebeen aswellachieved, atafraction ofthe
harm and cost,bythepayment ofafrank subsidy tothe
mine owners ortotheir workers; butCongress andthe
country would never have approved anaked steal ofthis
sortunaccompanied bytheideological flim-flam regard-
ing ^^silver’s essential roleinthenational currency.”
Tosavethecoalindustry Congress passed theGuffey
Act,under which theowners ofcoalmines were notonly
permitted, butcompelled, toconspire together nottosell
below certain minimum prices fixedbythegovernment.
Though Congress had started outtofix''the” price of
coal, thegovernment soonfound itself (because ofdif-
ferent sizes, thousands ofmines, andshipments tothou-
sands ofdifferent destinations by rail, truck, shipand
barge) fixing 350,000 separate prices forcoal!^One ef-
fectofthisattempt tokeep coal prices above thecompeti-
tivemarket levelwastoaccelerate thetendency toward the
substitution byconsumers ofother sources ofpower or
heat—^such asoil,natural gasandhydro-electric energy.
Butouraimhere isnottotrace alltheresults that fol-

loz ECONOMICS INONELESSON
lowed historically from efforts tosave particular industries,
buttotrace afewofthechief results thatmust necessarily
follow from efforts tosaveanindustry.
Itmaybeargued thatagiven industry must becreated
orpreserved formilitary reasons. Itmaybeargued thata
given industry isbeing ruined bytaxes orwage rates dis-
proportionate tothose ofother industries; orthat, ifapub-
licutility, itisbeing forced tooperate atrates orcharges
tothepublic thatdonotpermit anadequate profit mar-
gin.Such arguments may ormaynotbejustified inapar-
ticular case.Wearenotconcerned withthem here.Weare
concerned onlywith asingle argument forsaving theX
industry— that ifitisallowed toshrink insizeorperish
thro^gh theforces offreecompetition (always, byspokes-
men fortheindustry, designated insuch cases asalaissez-
faire, anarchic, cutthroat, dog-eat-dog, law-of-the-jungle
competition) itwillpulldown thegeneral economy with
it,andthat ifitisartificially kept alive itwillhelp every-
body else.
What wearetalking about here isnothing elsebuta
generalized caseoftheargument putforward for ^parity^^
prices forfarm products orfor tariff protection forany
number ofXindustries. Theargument against artificially
higher prices applies, ofcourse, notonly tofarm products
buttoanyother product, justasthereasons wehavefound
foropposing tariff protection foroneindustry apply to
anyother.
Butthere arealways anynumber ofschemes forsavingXindustries. There aretwomain types ofsuch proposals
SAVING THEXINDUSTHY I03
inaddition tothosewehave already considered, andwe
shall takeabrief glance atthem.One istocontend that
theXindustry isalready ^overcrowded/’ and totryto
prevent other firms orworkers from getting into it.The
other istoargue thattheXindustry needs tobesupported
byadirect subsidy from thegovernment.
Now iftheXindustry isreally overcrowded ascom"
pared with other industries itwillnotneedanycoercive
legislation tokeep outnew capital ornew workers. New
capital does notrush into industries that areobviously
dying. Investors donoteagerly seek theindustries that
present thehighest risks oflosscombined with thelowest
returns. Nordoworkers, when theyhaveanybetter alter-
native, gointo industries where thewages arelowest and
theprospects forsteady employment least promising.
Ifnew capital andnew labor areforcibly kept outof
theXindustry, however, either bymonopolies, cartels,
union policy orlegislation, itdeprives this capital and
labor ofliberty ofchoice. Itforces investors toplace their
money where thereturns seem lesspromising tothem than
intheXindustry. Itforces workers into industries with
even lower wages andprospects than they could find in
theallegedly sickXindustry. Itmeans, inshort, thatboth
capital andlabor areless efl&ciently employed than they
would beiftheywere permitted tomake theirown free
choices. Itmeans, therefore, alowering ofproduction
which must reflect itself inalower average living standard.
That lower living standard willbebrought about either
bylower average money wages thanwould otherwise pre-
i104 economics INONELESSON
Ivailorbyhigher average living costs, orbyacombination
I; ofboth.(The exact result would depend upon theaccom-
i
;panying monetary policy.) Bythese restrictive policies
; wages and capital returns might indeed bekept higher
;’than otherwise within theXindustry itself; butwages and
capital returns inother industries would beforced down
lower than otherwise. TheXindustiy would benefit only
^beexpense oftheA,BandGindustries.
3
Similar results would follow anyattempt tosavetheX
industry byadirect subsidy outofthepublic till.This
would benothing more than atransfer ofwealth orin-
come totheXindustry. The taxpayers would lose pre-
cisely asmuch asthepeople intheXindustry gained. The
great advantage ofasubsidy, indeed, from thestandpoint
ofthepublic, isthat itmakes thisfactsoclear.There isfar
lessopportunity fortheintellectual obfuscation thataccom-
panies arguments for tariffs, minimum-price fixing or
monopolistic exclusion.
Itisobvious inthecaseofasubsidy thatthetaxpayers
must loseprecisely asmuch astheXindustry gains. It
should beequally clear that, dsaconsequence, other in-
dustries must losewhat theXindustry gains. They must
paypartofthetaxes that areused tosupport theXin-
dustry.^ Andconsumers, because they aretaxed tosupport
theXindustry, willhave thatmuch lessincome leftwith
SAVING THEXINHUSTRY I05
which tobuyOther things. Theresuk must bethatother
industries ontheaverage must besmaller than otherwise
inorder thattheXindustry maybelarger.
Buttheresult ofthissubsidy isnotmerely thatthere
hasbeen atransfer ofwealth orincome, orthatother in-
dustries haveshrunk intheaggregate asmuch astheX
industry hasexpanded. The result isalso(and this is
where thenetlosscomes intothenation considered asa
unit) that capital andlabor aredriven outofindustries in
which they aremore efficiently employed tobediverted to
anindustry inwhich they are less efficiently employed.
Lesswealth iscreated. The average standard ofliving is
loweied compared withwhat itwould have been.
4
These results arevirtually inherent, infact, inthevery
arguments putforward tosubsidize theXindustry. The
Xindustry isshrinking ordying bythecontention ofits
friends. Why, itmaybeasked, should itbekept aliveby
artificial respiration? The idea thatanexpanding economy
implies that allindustries must besimultaneously expand-
ing isaprofound error. Inorder thatnew industries may
grow fastenough itisnecessary thatsome oldindustries
should beallowed toshrink ordie.They must dothisin
order torelease thenecessary capital andlabor forthenew
industries. Ifwehad tried tokeep thehorse-and-buggy
trade artificially aliveweshould have slowed down the
growth oftheautomobile industry and allthetrades de-
fl^^
[' Jo6 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
Ipendent onitWeshould have lowered theproduction of
} wealth andretarded economic and scientific prc^ess.
. Wedothesame thing, however, whenwetrytopre-
; ventanyindustry from dying inorder toprotect thelabor
already trained orthecapital already invested init.Para-
. doxical asitmayseem tosome, itisjust asnecessary to
jthehealth ofadynamic economy thatdying industries he

foolish totrytopreserve obsolescent industries astotryto
preserve obsolescent methods ofproduction: this isoften,
infact,merely twoways ofdescribing thesame thing. Im-
proved methods ofproduction must constantly supplant
:• obsolete methods, ifbotholdneeds andnewwants aretobe
fiUedbybetter commodities andbetter means.
CHAPTER SV
HOWTHEPRICE SYSTEM
WORKS
Thewhole argument ofthisbookmayhesummed up
inthestatement that instudying theeffects ofany
given economic proposal wemust trace notmerely theim-
mediate results buttheresults inthelong run,notmerely
theprimary consequences butthesecondary consequences,
: andnotmerely theeffects .onsome special group butthe
jeffects oneveryone. Itfollows that itisfoolish andmislead-
jingtoconcentrate ourattention merely onsome special
point—toexamine, forexample, merely what happens in
oneindustry without considering whathappens inall.But
itisprecisely from thepersistent andlazyhabit ofthinking
onlyofsome particular industry orprocess inisolation that
themajor fallacies ofeconomics stem.These fallacies per-
vadenotmerely thearguments ofthehired spokesmen of
special interests, butthearguments even ofsome econo-
Imistswhopass asprofound.
IItisonthefallacy ofisolation, atbottom, thatthe“pro-
duction-for-use-and-not-for-profit” school isbased, with its
attack ontheallegedly vicious "price system.” Theproblem
ofproduction, saytheadherents ofthisschool, issolved.
(This resounding error, asweshall see, isalsothestarting
107
"•1
io8 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
point ofmost currency cranks andshare-the-wealth char-
latans.) Theproblem ofproduction issolved. The scien-
tists, theeflSciency experts, theengineers, thetechnicians,
have solved it.They could turn outalmost anything
youcared tomention inhuge and practically unlimited
amounts. But, alas,theworld isnotruledbytheengineers,
thinking only ofproduction, butbythebusiness men,
thinking onlyofprofit.Thebusiness men give their orders
totheengineers, instead ofvice versa. These business
men willturnoutanyobject aslong asthere isaprofit
indoing so,butthemoment there isnolonger aprofit
inmaking that article, thewicked business men willstop
making it,though many people's wants areunsatisfied, and
theworld iscrying formore goods.
There aresomany fallacies inthisview thatthey can-
not allbedisentangled atonce.Butthecentral error, aswe
have hinted, comes from looking atonlyoneindustry, or
even atseveral industries inturn, asifeach ofthem existed
inisolation. Each ofthem infact exists inrelation toall
theothers, andevery important decision made initis
affected byand affects thedecisions made inalltheothers.

Letusnowturn tosuch asociety. How istheproblem
ofalternative apphcations oflabor and capital, tomeet
thousands ofdifferent needs andwants ofdifferent urgen-
cies, solved insuch asociety? Itissolved precisely through
theprice system. Itissolved through theconstantly chang-
inginterrelationships ofcosts ofproduction, prices and
profits.
Prices arefixed through therelationship ofsupply and
demand, andinturn affect supply anddemand. When
people wantmore ofanarticle, they offermore for it.The
price goesup.This increases theprofits ofthosewhomake
thearticle. Because itisnowmore profitable, tomaVp that
HOWTHEPRICE SYSTEM WORKS III

1article than others, thepeople already inthebusiness ex-
pand their production ofit,andmore people areattracted
tothebusiness. This increased supply then reduces the
priceandreduces theprofit margin, until theprofit margin
onthat article oncemore falls tothegeneral level of
profits (relative risksconsidered) inother industries. Orthe
demand forthat article may fall;orthesupply ofitmay
beincreased tosuch apoint that itsprice drops toalevel
where there islessprofit inmaking itthan inmaking other
articles; orperhaps there isanactual lossinmaking it.In
thiscasethe'marginar' producers, that is,theproducers
who areleast efficient, orwhose costs ofproduction are
highest, willbedriven outofbusiness altogether. The
product willnowbemade onlybythemore efficient pro-
ducers who operate onlower costs.The supply ofthat
commodity will alsodrop, orwill atleast cease toexpand.
This process istheorigin ofthebelief that prices are
determined bycosts ofproduction. The doctrine, stated in
thisform, isnottrue. Prices aredetermined bysupply and
demand, anddemand isdetermined byhow intensely
people want acommodity andwhat theyhave tooffer in
exchange for it.Itistruethatsupply isinpartdetermined
bycosts ofproduction. What acommodity hascost topro-
duce inthepastcannot determine itsvalue. That will
depend onthepresent relationship ofsupply anddemand.
Buttheexpectations ofbusiness men concerning what a
commodity vHllcost toproduce inthefuture, andwhat its
future price willbe,willdetermine howmuch ofitwillbe
made. This will affect future supply. There istherefore a
II2 ECONOMICS INONE'EESS0:N^^
! constant tendency fortheprice ofacommodity and its
I marginal costofproduction toequal each other, butnot
because thatmarginal costofproduction directly determines
theprice.
The private enterprise system, then,migh tbecompared
tothousands ofmachines, each regulated byitsown cjuasi-
automatic governor, yetwith these machines and their
governors allinterconnected andinfluencing each other,
sothatthey actineffect likeonegreat machine. Most of
usmusthave noticed theautomatic ^governor ^onasteam
engine. Itusually consists oftwo balls orweights which
work bycentrifugal force. Asthespeed oftheengine
increases, these balls flyaway from therodtowhich they
areattached and soautomatically narrow orclose oflFa
throttle valvewhich regulates theintake ofsteam andthus
slowsdown theengine. Iftheengine goes tooslowly, on
theother hand, theballs drop, widen thethrottle valve,
andincrease theengine sspeed. Thus every departure from
thedesired speed itself setsinmotion theforces thattend
tocorrect thatdeparture.
Itisprecisely inthisway that therelative supply of
thousands ofdifferent commodities isregulated under the
system ofcompetitive private enterprise. When people want
more ofacommodity, their competitive bidding raises its
price. This increases theprofits oftheproducers whomake
thatproduct. This stimulates them toincrease their pro-
duction. Itleads others tostopmaking some oftheproducts
Aeypreviously made, andturn tomaking theproduct that
offers them thebetter return. But thisincreases thesupply
HOW*THE PB.IGE SYSTEM WORKS
ofthatcommodity atthesame time that itreduces thesup-
plyofsome other commodities. The price ofthatproduct
therefore fallsinrelation totheprice ofother products, and
thestimulus totherelative increase initsproduction dis-
appears.
Inthesame way, ifthedemand falls offforsome prod'
uct, itspriceandtheprofit inmaking itgolower, and its
production declines.
Itisthis lastdevelopment that scandalizes thosewho
donotunderstand the*price system*^ theydenounce. They
accuse itofcreating scarcity. Why, they askindignantly,
should manufacturers cutofftheproduction ofshoes at
thepoint where itbecomes unprofitable toproduce any
more?Why should theybeguided merely bytheirown
profits?Why should theybeguided bythemarket? Why
dotheynotproduce shoes tothe ^^full capacity ofmodem
technical processes^7 The price system andprivate enter-
prise, conclude the“production-for-use” philosophers, are
merely aform of'^scarcity economics.^^
These questions andconclusions stemfrom thefallacy
oflooking atoneindustry inisolation, oflooking atthe
treeandignoring theforest.Uptoacertain point itis
necessary toproduce shoes. But itisalso necessary to
produce coats, shirts, trousers, homes, plows, shovels, fac-
tories, bridges, milkandbread. Itwould beidiotic togo
onpiling upmountains ofsurplus shoes, simply because
wecould doit,while hundreds ofmore urgent needs went
unfilled.
Now inaneconomy inequilibrium, agiven industry
t
.il114 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
canexpand only attheexpense ofother industries. For
atanymoment thefactors ofproduction arelimited. One
industry canbeexpanded onlybydiverting toitlabor,
landand capital thatwould otherwise beemployed in
other industries. Andwhen agiven industry shrinks, or
stops expanding itsoutput, itdoesnotnecessarily mean
diatthere hasbeenanynetdecline inaggregate production.
Theshrinkage atthatpointmayhavemerely released labor
and capital topermit theexpansion ofother industries. It
iserroneous toconclude, therefore, thatashrinkage of
production inoneline necessarily means ashrinkage in
totoZ production.
Everything, inshort, isproduced attheexpense offore-
going something else. Costs ofproduction themselves, in
fact,might bedefined asthethings thataregivenup(the
leisure and pleasures, therawmaterials with alternative
potential uses) inorder tocreate thething that ismade.
Itfollows that itisjustasessential forthehealth ofa
dynamic economy thatdying industries should beallowed
todieasthatgrowing industries should beallowed togrow.
Forthedying industries absorb laborandcapital thatshould
hereleased forthegrowing industries. Itisonlythemuch
vilified price system that solves theenormously complicated
problem ofdeciding precisely howmuch oftensofthou-
sandsofdiflFerent commodities andservices should bepro-
duced inrelation toeach other. These otherwise bewilder-

‘STABILIZIN GOMMODITIES
ATTEMPTS tolifttheprices ofparticular commodities
permanently above their natural market levels have
failed sooften, sodisastrously and sonotoriously that
sophisticated pressure groups, andthebureaucrats upon
whom theyapply thepressure, seldom openly avow that
aim.Their stated aims, particularly when they are first
proposing thatthegovernment intervene, areusually more
modest, andmore plausible.
They havenowish, they declare, toraise theprice of
commodity Xpermanently above itsnatural level. That,
theyconcede, would beunfair toconsumers. But itisnow
obviously selling farhelow itsnatural level.Theproducers
cannot make aliving. Unless weactpromptly, they will
bethrown outofbusiness. Then there willbeareal
scarcity, andconsumers willhave topayexorbitant prices
forthecommodity. Theapparent bargains thatthecon-
sumers arenow getting willcostthem dear intheend.For
thepresent ^^temporaiy'^ low price cannot last.Butwe
cannot afford towait forso-called natural market forces,
orforthe ''blin lawofsupply anddemand, tocorrect

actAllthatwereallywant todoistocorrect these violent,
senseless fl^ictuations inprice.Wearenottrying tohoosf
theprice;weareonly trying tostabilize it.
inhere areseveral metho^^ bywhich itiscommoni)'
proposed todothis.One ofthemost frequent isgovern-
ment loans to£arn:ers toenable them tohold their crops
offthemarket.
Such loans areurged inCongress forreasons thatseem
very plausible tomost listeners. They aretold that the
farmers’ crops are alldumped onthemarket atonce, at
harvest time; that this isprecisely thetimewhen prices
arelowest, and that speculators takeadvantage ofthisto
buythecrops themselves andholdthem forhigher prices
when food gets scarcer again. Thus itisurged that the
farmers suffer, andthat they, rather than thespeculators,
should gettheadvantage ofthehigher average price.
Thisargument isnotsupported byeither theory orex-
perience. Themuch-reviled speculators arenottheenemy
ofthefarmer; they areessential tohisbest welfare. The
risks offluctuating farm prices mustbeborne bysomebody;
theyhave infactbeenborne inmodem times chiefly bythe
professional speculators. Ingeneral, themore coihpetently
thelatter actintheirown interest asspeculators, themore
theyhelp thefanner. Forspeculators serve theirown in-
terest precisely inproportion totheir ability toforesee future
prices. Butthemore accurately they foresee future prices
dielessviolent orextreme arethefluctuations inprices.
Even iffarmers had todump theirwhole crop ofwheat
onthemarket inasingle month oftheyear, therefore,
Il8 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
theprice inthatmonth would notnecessarily hebelow
theprice atanyothermonth (apart fromanallowance for
thecostsofstorage). Forspeculators, inthehope ofmaking
aprofit, would domost oftheirbuying atthattime.They
would keeponbupng until theprice rose toapointwhere
theysawnofurther opportunity offuture profit. They
would sellwhenever theythought there wasaprospect of
future loss.The result would betostabilize theprice of
farmcommodities theyearround.
Itisprecisely because aprofessional class ofspeculators
exists totake these risks thatfarmers andmiUers donot
need totake them. The latter can protect themselves
through themarkets. Under normal conditions, therefore,
when speculators aredoing their jobwell, theprofits of
fanners andmillers willdepend chiefly ontheir skilland
industry infarming ormilling, andnotonmarket fluctu-
ations.
Actual experience shows thatontheaverage theprice
ofwheat andother non-perishable crops remains thesame
aUyearround except foranallowance forstorage and
insurance charges. Infact,some careful investigations have
shown thattheaverage monthly rise after harvest time
hasnotbeen quite sufficient topaysuch storage charges,
sothatthespeculators have actually subsidized thefarmers.
This, ofcourse, wasnotfheir intention: ithassimply been
theresult ofapersistent tendency toover-optimism onthe
partofspeculators. (This tendency seems toaffect entre-
preneurs inmost competitive pursuits: asaclass they are
constantly, contrary tointention, subsidizing consumers.
STABILIZING COMMODITIES 119
This isparticularly trae-wherever theprospects ofbigspec-
ulative gains exist. Justasthesubscribers toalottery, con-
sidered asaunit, losemoney because each isunjustifiably
hopeful ofdrawing oneofthefewspectacular prizes, soit
hasbeen calculated thatthetotal laborandcapital dumped
into prospecting forgold oroilhasexceeded the total
value ofthegoldoroilextracted.)
The case isdifferent, however, when theState steps in
andeither buys thefarmers’ crops itself orlendsthem the
money tohold thecrops offthemarlcet. This issometimes
done inthename ofmaintaining what isplausibly called
an"ever-normal granary.” Butthehistory ofprices and
annual carry-overs ofcrops shows that thisfunction, as
wehave seen, isalready being wellperformed bythe
privately organized freemarkets. When thegovernment
steps in,the“ever-normal granary” becomes infactan
ever-political granary. Thefarmer isencouraged, tvith the
taxpayers’ money, to-withhold hiscrops excessively.
Because they -wish tomake sureofretaining thefarmer’s
vote, thepoliticians who initiate thepolicy, orthebureau-
cratswhocany itout,always place theso-called “fair”
price forthefarmer’s product above theprice thatsupply
anddemand conditions atthetime justify. This leads toa
falling offinbuyers. The“ever-normal” granary therefore
tends tobecome anever-abnormal granary. Excessive stocks
areheld offthemarket. The effect ofthis istosecure a
120 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
higher price temporarily thanwould otherwise exist, but
todosoonlybybringing about lateronamuch lower price
thanwould otherwise have existed. Forthe artificial short-
agebuiltupthisyearbywithholding part ofacropfrom
themarket means anartificial* surplus thenext year.
Itwould carry ustoofarafield todescribe indetail what
actually happened when thisprogram was applied, for
example, toAmerican cotton.Wepiledupanentire year s
crop instorage.Wedestroyed theforeign market forour
cotton.Westimulated enormously thegrowth ofcotton in
other countries. Though these results hadbeen predicted
byopponents oftherestriction andloan policy, when they
actually happened thebureaucrats responsible fortheresult
merely replied thattheywould havehappened anyway.
Fortheloanpolicy isusually accompanied by,orinevi-
tably leads to,apolicy ofrestricting production— ^i.e.,a
policy ofscarcity. Innearly every effort to'stabilize” the
price ofacommodity, theinterests oftheproducers have
been put first.The realobject isanimmediate boost of
prices.Tomake thispossible, aproportional restriction of
output isusually placed oneach producer subject tothe
control. This hasseveral immediately bad effects. Assum-
ingthatthecontrol canbeimposed onaninternational
scale, itmeans that total world production iscut.The
world^s consumers areable toenjoy lessofthatproduct
than theywould have enjoyed without restriction. The
world isjust thatmuch poorer. Because consumers are
forced topayhigher prices than otherwise forthatproduct,
theyhave justthatmuch lesstospend onother products.

! The restrictionists usually reply that thisdrop :noutput
'iswhat happens anyway under amarket economy. But
‘ there isafundamental difference, aswehave seen inthe
Ipreceding chapter. Inacompetitive market economy, itis
thehigh-cost producers, theinefficient producers, thatare
driven outbyafallinprice. Inthecaseofanagricultural
j commodity itistheleastcompetent farmers, orthose with
thepoorest equipment, orthose working thepoorest land,

landdonothave torestrict their production. Onthecon-
I trary, ifthefallinprice hasbeen S3miptomatic ofalower
average costofproduction, reflected through anincreased
supply, then thedriving outofthemarginal farmers on
themarginal land enables thegood farmers onthegood
land toexpand their production. Sotheremay be,inthe
longrun,noreduction whatever intheoutput ofthatcom-
modity. And theproduct isthenproduced andsold ata
permanently lower price.
Ifthat istheoutcome, then dieconsumers ofthatcom-
modity willbeaswellsupplied with itastheywere before.
But,asaresult ofthelower price, they willhavemoney left
over,which they didnothave before, tospend onother
things. Theconsumers, therefore, willobviously bebetter
off.But their increased spending inother directions will
giveincreased employment inother lines, which willthen
absorb theformer marginal farmers inoccupations inwhich
their efforts willbemore lucrative andmore eflScient.
122 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
Auniform proportional restriction (toreturn toour
government intervention scheme) means, ontheonehand,
thattheefficient low-cost producers arenotpermitted to
turnoutalltheoutput theycanatalow price. Itmeans,
ontheother hand, thattheinefficient high-cost producers
areartificially kept inbusiness. This increases theaverage
costofproducing theproduct. Itisbeing produced less
efficiently than otherwise. The inefficient marginal pro-
ducer thus artificially kept inthat lineofproduction con-
tinues totieupland, labor, and capital thatcouldmuch
more profitably and efficiently bedevoted toother uses.
There isnopoint inarguing that asaresult ofthe
restriction scheme atleast theprice offarm products has
been raised and thefarmers havemore purchasing power.”
They havegot itonlybytaking justthatmuch purchasing
power away from thecitybuyer.(Wehavebeen over all
thisground before inouranalysis of"parity” prices.) To
give farmers money forrestricting production, ortogive
them thesameamount ofmoney foranartificially restricted
production, isnodifferent from forcing consumers ortax-
payers topaypeople fordoing nothing atall.Ineach case
thebeneficiaries ofsuch policies get"purchasing power.”
Butineach casesomeone else losesanexactly equivalent
amount. Thenetlosstothecommunity isthelossofpro-
duction, because people aresupported fornotproducing.
Because there islessforeverybody, because there isless
togoaround, realwages and realincomes must dp^lin^
either through afallintheirmonetary amount orthrough
higher living costs.

But ifanattempt ismade tokeepuptheprice ofan
agricultural commodity andnoartificial restriction ofout-
put isimposed, unsold surpluses oftheover-priced com-
modity continue topileupuntil themarket forthatproduct
finally collapses toafargreater extent than ifthecontrol
program hadnever beenputinto effect.Orproducers out-
sidetherestriction program, stimulated bytheartificial rise
inprice, expand theirownproduction enormously. This is
whathappened totheBritish rubber restriction andthe
American cotton restriction programs. Ineither casethecol-
lapse ofprices finally goes tocatastrophic lengths thatwould
never havebeen reached without therestriction scheme.
Theplan that started out$0bravely to^'stabilize*' prices
andconditions brings incomparably greater instability than
thefreeforces ofthemarket could possibly have brought.
Ofcourse theinternational commodity controls thatare
being proposed now,wearetold, aregoing toavoid all
these errors. This time prices aregoing tobefixed thatare
'*fair*notonly forproducers butforconsumers. Producing
andconsuming nations aregoing toagree onjustwhat
these fairprices are,because noonewillbeunreasonable.
Fixed prices will necessarily involve "just'' allotments and
allocations forproduction andconsumption asamong
nations, butonly cynics willanticipate anyunseemly inter-
national disputes regarding these. Finally, bythegreatest
miracle ofall,thispostwar world ofsuper-international
controls andcoercions isalsogoing tobeaworld of"free"
international trade!
Justwhat thegovernment planners mean byfree trade
124 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
inthisconnection Iamnotsure, butwecanbesureof
some ofthethings theydonotmean. They donotmean
thefreedom ofordinary people tobuyand sell,lendand
borrow, atwhatever prices orrates they likeandwherever
they find itmost profitable todoso.They donotmean
thefreedom oftheplain citizen toraise asmuch ofagiven
crop ashewishes, tocomeandgoatwill, tosettlewhere

tosettle these matters forhim.Andthey tellhimthat ifhe
docilely obeys thebureaucrats hewillberewarded bya
riseinhisliving standards. But iftheplanners succeed
intyinguptheidea ofinternational cooperation with the
ideaofincreased State domination and control over eco-
nomic life,theinternational controls ofthefuture seem
only toolikely tofollow thepattern ofthepast, inwhich
casetheplain man's living standards willdecline with his

CHAPTER XVII

1GOVERNMENT PRICE-FIXING
WEHAVE seenwhatsome oftheeffects areofgovern-
mental efforts tofixtheprices ofcommodities above
thelevels towhich freemarkets would otherwise have
carried them. Letusnow look atsome oftheresults of
government attempts tohold theprices ofcommodities
helow their natural market levels.
The latter attempt ismade inourdaybynearly all
governments inwartime. We shall notexamine here the
wisdom ofwartime price-fixing. Thewhole economy, in
total war, isnecessarily dominated bytheState, andthe
complications thatwould have tobeconsidered would carry
ustoofarbeyond themain question withwhich thisbook
isconcerned. Butwartime price-fixing, wise ornot, isin
almost allcountries continued foratleast long periods
after thewar isover,when theoriginal excuse forstarting
ithasdisappeared.
Letusfirst seewhat happens when thegovernment
tries tokeep theprice ofasingle commodity, orasmall
group ofcommodities, below theprice thatwould beset
inafreecompetitive market.
When thegovernment tries tofixmaximum prices for
onlyafewitems, itusually'chooses certain basic necessities.
125
126 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
ontheground that itismost essential that^^^^A be
able toobtain these ataLeasonable'^ cost.Letussaythat
theitems chosen forthispurpose arebread, milkand
meat.
Theargument forholding down theprice ofthese goods
willrunsomething like this. Ifweleave beef (letussay)
tothemercies ofthefreemarket, theprice willbepushed
upbycompetitive bidding sothatonly therich willget it.
People willgetbeefnotinproportion totheir need, but
only inproportion totheir purchasing power. Ifwekeep
thepricedown, everyone willgethisfairshare.
The firstthing tobenoticed about thisargument isthat
ifitisvalid thepolicy adopted isinconsistent andtimorous.
For ifpurchasing power rather thanneed determines the
distribution ofbeef atamarket price of65cents apound,
itwould alsodetermine it,though perhaps toaslightly
smaller degree, at,say,alegal/'ceiling^^ price of50cents a
pound. The purchasing-power-rather-than-need argument,
infact,holds aslong aswecharge anything forbeefwhat-
ever. Itwould cease toapply only ifbeefwere given away.
Butschemes formaximum price-fixing usually begin as
efforts to''keep thecostofliving from rising.” And sotheir
sponsors unconsciously assume that there issomething
peculiarly "normal” orsacrosanct about themarket price
atthemoment fromwhich their control starts. That start-
ingprice isregarded as"reasonable,” andanyprice above
that as"unreasonable, ”*T:egardless ofchanges inthecondi-
tions ofproduction ordemand since that starting price
was first established. #
GOVERNMENT PRICE-FIXING IZ7
Z
Indiscussing thissubject, there isnopoint inassuming
aprice control thatwould fixprices exactly where afree
market would placethem inany case.Thatwould bethe
same ashaving noprice control atall.Wemustassume that
thepurchasing power inthehands ofthepublic isgreater
thanthesupply ofgoods available, andthatprices arebeing
helddown bythegovernment hehw thelevels towhich a
freemarket vsiould putthem.
Nowwecannot hold theprice ofanycommodity below
itsmarket level without intimebringing about twocon-
sequences. The first istoincrease thedemand forthatcom-
modify. Because thecommodity ischeaper, people areboth
tempted tobuy,andcanafford tobuy,more ofit.The
second consequence istoreduce thesupply ofthatcom-
modity. Because people buymore, theaccumulated supply
ismore quickly taken from theshelves ofmerchants. But
inaddition tothis,production ofthatcommodity isdis-
couraged. Profit margins arereduced orwiped out.The
marginal producers aredriven outofbusiness. Even the
most efficient producers maybecalled upon toturnout
their product ataloss.Thishappened inthewarwhen
slaughter houses were required bytheOffice ofPriceAd-
ministration toslaughter andprocess meat forlessthan
thecost tothem ofcattleonthehoofandthelabor of
slaughter andprocessing.
Ifwedidnothing else, therefore, theconsequence of
fixing amaximum price foraparticular commodity would
128 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
betobring about ashortage ofthatcommodity. But this
isprecisely theopposite ofwhat thegovernment regulators
originally wanted todo.For itistheverycommodities
selected formaximum price-fixing thattheregulators most
want tokeep inabundant supply. Butwhen they limit the
wages andtheprofits ofthosewhomake these commodities,
without alsolimiting thewages and profits ofthosewho
make luxuries orsemi-luxuries, they discourage thepro-
duction oftheprice-controlled necessities while they rela-
tively stimulate theproduction oflessessential goods.
Some ofthese consequences intimebecome apparent
totheregulators, who then adopt various other devices
and controls inanattempt toavert them.Among these
devices arerationing, cost-control, subsidies, anduniversal
price-fixing. Letuslook ateach ofthese inturn.
When itbecomes obvious thatashortage ofsome com-
modity isdeveloping asaresult ofa;price fixedbelow the
market, richconsumers areaccused oftaking^Wre than
their fair share''; or,ifitisarawmaterial thatenters into
manufacture, individual firms areaccused of'"hoarding"
it.Thegovernment then adopts asetofrules concerning
who shallhave priority inbuying thatcommodity, orto
whom andinwhat quantities itshallbeallocated, orhow
itshall berationed. Ifarationing system isadopted, it
means thateachconsumer canhave only acertain maxi-
mum supply, nomatterhowmuch heiswilling topayfor
more.
Ifarationing system isadopted, inbrief, itmeans that
thegovernment adopts adouble price system, oradual
I
GOVERNMENT PRICE-FIXING I29
currency system, inwhich eachconsumer must have a
certain number ofcoupons or^points^V inaddition toa
givenamount ofordinary money. Inother words, thegov-
ernment tries todothrough rationing partofthejobthat
afreemarket would havedone through prices. Isayonly
partofthejob,because rationing merely limits thedemand
without alsostimulating thesupply, asahigher pricewould
have done.
Thegovernment may trytoassure supply through ex-
tending itscontrol over thecosts ofproduction ofacom-
modity. Toholddown theretail price ofbeef, forexample,
itmay fixthewholesale price ofbeef, theslaughter-house
price ofbeef, theprice oflive cattle, theprice offeed, the
wages offarmhands. Toholddown thedelivered price of
milk, itmay trytofixthewages ofmilk-wagon drivers, the
price ofcontainers, thefarm price ofmilk, theprice of
feedstujffs. Tofixtheprice ofbread, itmay fixthewages
inbakeries, theprice offlour, theprofits ofmillers, the
price ofwheat, andsoon.
But asthegovernment extends this price-fixing back-
wards, itextends atthesame time theconsequences that
originally drove ittothiscourse. Assuming that ithasthe
courage tofixthese costs,and isable toenforce itsdecisions,
then itmerely, inturn, creates shortages ofthevarious
factors—^labor, feedstuffs, wheat, orwhatever—thatenter
into theproduction ofthe final commodities. Thus the
government isdriven tocontrols inever-widening circles,
andthefinal consequence willbethesame asthat of
universal price-fixing.
ECONOMICS INONELESSON
Thegovernment may trytomeet this difficulty through
subsidies. Itrecognizes, forexample, thatwhen itkeeps
theprice ofmilk orbutter below thelevel ofthemarket,
orbelow therelative level atwhich itfixesother prices, a
.shortage may result because oflower wages orprofit margins
fortheproduction ofmilk orbutter ascompared with other
commodities. Therefore thegovernment attempts tocom-
pensate forthisbypaying asubsidy tothemilkandbutter
producers. Passing over theadministrative difficulties in-
volved inthis,andassuming thatthesubsidy isjustenough
toassure thedesired relative production ofmilkandbutter,
itisclear that,though thesubsidy ispaid toproducers,
thosewho arereally being subsidized aretheconsumers.
Fortheproducers areonnetbalance getting nomore for
their milkandbutter than iftheyhadbeen allowed to
charge thefreemarket price inthe firstplace; butthecon-
sumers aregetting their milkandbutter atagreat deal
below thefreemarket price.They arebeing subsidized to
theextent ofthedifference—that is,bytheamount of
subsidy paid ostensibly totheproducers.
Now unless thesubsidized commodity isalsorationed,
itisthose with themost purchasing power thatcanbuy
most ofit.Thismeans thatthey arebeing subsidized more
than those vrith lesspurchasing power.Who subsidizes the
consumers willdepend upon theincidence oftaxation. But
men intheir roleoftaxpayers willbesubsidizing them-
selves intheir roleofconsumers. Itbecomes alittle difficult
totrace inthismaze precisely who issubsidizing whom.
What isforgotten isthatsubsidies arepaid forbysomeone,

and thatnomethod hasbeen discovered by’which the
community getssomething fornothing.

Price-fixing may often appear forashort period tobe
successful. Itcanseem towork well forawhile, particu-
larly inwartime, when itissupported bypatriotism anda
sense ofcrisis. Butthelonger itisineffect themore its
dfficulties increase. When prices arearbitrarily helddown
bygovernment compulsion, demand ischronically inexcess
ofsupply.Wehave seen that ifthegovernment attempts
toprevent ashortage ofacommodity byreducing alsothe
prices ofthelabor, rawmaterials andother factors thatgo
into itscostofproduction, itcreates ashortage ofthese in
turn.Butnotonly willthegovernment, ifitpursues this
course, find itnecessary toextend price control moreand
more downwards, or^Vertically''; itwill find itnoless
necessary toextend price control 'liorizontally," Ifwe
ration onecommodity, andthepublic cannot getenough
ofit,though itstillhasexcess purchasing power, itwill
turn tosome substitute. The rationing ofeachcommodity
asitgrows scarce, inother words, mustputmoreandmore
pressure ontheunrationed commodities that remain. If
weassume thatthegovernment issuccessful initsefforts
toprevent black markets (oratleast prevents them from
developing onasuifficient scale tonullify itslegal prices),
continued price control must drive ittotherationing of
moreandmore commodities. This rationing cannot stop
132 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
with consumers* Inwar itdidnotstopwith consumers*
Itwasapplied firstofall,infact, intheallocation ofraw
materials toproducers*
The natural consequence ofathoroughgoing over-all
price control which seeks toperpetuate agiven historic price
level, inbrief, must ultimately beacompletely regimented
economy. Wages would have tobehelddown asrigidly as
prices. Labor would have toberationed asruthlessly as
raw materials* Theend result would bethatthegovern-
ment would notonly telleachconsumer precisely how
much ofeachcommodity hecould have; itwould telleach
manufacturer precisely what quantity ofeachrawmaterial
hecould haveandwhat quantity oflabor. Competitive
bidding forworkers could nomorebetolerated thancom-
petitive bidding formaterials. The result would beapetri-
fied totalitarian economy, with every business firmand
every worker atthemercy ofthegovernment, andwith a
finalabandonment ofallthetraditional liberties wehave
known. ForasAlexander Hamilton pointed outinthe
Federalist papers acentury andahalf ago, ''Apower over
aman^s subsistence amounts toapower over hiswill/'

These aretheconsequences ofwhatmight bedescribed
as^perfect," long-continued, and ^^non-politicar' price con-
trol.Aswassoamply demonstrated inonecountry after
another, particularly inEurope during and afterWorld
War II,some ofthemore fantastic errors ofthebureaucrats
GOVERNMENT PRICE-FIXING I33
were mitigated bytheblack market. Itwasacommon story
frommany European countries thatpeople were able to
getenough tostay aliveonlybypatronizing dieblack mar-
ket.Insome countries theblack market keptgrowing at
theexpense ofthelegally recognized fixed-price market
until theformer became, ineffect, themarket. Bynominally
keeping theprice ceilings, however, thepoliticians inpower
tried toshow that their hearts, ifnottheir enforcement
squads, were intheright place.
Because theblack market, however, finally supplanted
thelegal price-ceiling market, itmust notbesupposed that
noharm wasdone.Theharm wasboth economic and
moral. During /the transition period thelarge, long-estab-
lished firms, with aheavy capital investment andagreat
dependence upon theretention ofpublic good-will, are
forced torestrict ordiscontinue production. Their place is
taken byfly-by-night concerns with little capital and little
accumulated experience inproduction. Thesenew firms are
inefficient compared with those they displace; they turn
outinferior anddishonest goods atmuch higher production
coststhan theolder concerns would have required forcon-
tinuing toturnouttheir former goods.Apremium isput
ondishonesty. Thenew firmsowe their very existence
orgrowth tothefact thatthey arewilling toviolate the
law; their customers conspire with them; and asanatural
consequence demoralization spreads into allbusiness
practices.
Itisseldom, moreover, thatanyhonest effort ismadeby
theprice-fixing audiorities merely topreserve thelevel of-
134 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
prices existing when their efforts began. They declare that
their intention isto*liold theline.” Soon, however, under
theguise of"correcting inequities” or“social injustices,”
theybegin adiscruninatory price-fixing which gives most
tothose groups that arepolitically powerful and l^astto
other groups.
Aspolitical power today ismostcommonly measured by
votes, thegroups thattheauthorities most often attempt to
favor areworkers andfarmers. Atfirst itiscontended that
wages andliving costs arenotconnected; thatwages can
easily belifted without lifting prices.When itbecomes
obvious thatwages canberaised only attheexpense of
profits, thebureaucrats begin toargue that profits were
already toohighanyway, andthat lifting wages andholding
prices vriU stillpermit “afair profit.” Asthere isnosuch
thing asauniform rateofprofit, asprofits differ witheach
concern, theresult ofthispolicy istodrive the least
profitable concerns outofbusiness altogether, and todis-
courage orstoptheproduction ofcertain items. This
unemployment, ashrinkage inproduction andadppimp in
living standards.

What liesatthebaseofthewhole effort tofixmaximum
prices? There isfirstofallamisunderstanding ofwhat itis
thathasbeen causing prices torise.The realcause iseither
ascarcity ofgoods orasurplus ofmoney. Legal price ceil-
ingscannot cure either. Infact, aswehave justseen, they
merely intensify theshortage ofgoods.What todoabout
GOVERNMENT PRIGE-EIXING 135
f thesurplus ofmoney willbediscussed inalater chapter*
Butoneoftheerrors that liebehind thedrive forprice-
* fixing isthechief subject ofthisbook. Just astheendless
plans forraising prices offavored commodities arethe
. result ofthinking oftheinterests only oftheproducers
immediately concerned, and forgetting the interests of
consumers, sotheplans forholding down prices bylegal
edict aretheresult ofthinking oftheinterests ofpeople
^ only asconsumers and forgetting their interests aspro-
ducers. And thepolitical support forsuch policies springs
from asimilar confusion inthepublic mind. People donot
want topaymore formilk, butter, shoes, furniture, rent,
^theater tickets ordiamonds. Whenever anyofthese items
risesabove itsprevious level theconsumer becomes indig-
nant,and feels thatheisbeing rooked.
Theonly exception istheitemhemakes himself: here
heunderstands andappreciates thereason forthe rise.But
; heisalways likely toregard hisown business asinsome
jwayanexception, *'Nowmyown business,” hewill say,
! peculiar, andthepublic doesnotunderstand it.Labor
* costshavegone up;rawmaterial prices havegone up;this
Iorthatrawmaterial isnolonger being imported, andmust
bemade atahigher costathome. Moreover, thedemand
fortheproduct hasincreased, andthebusiness should be
I allowed tocharge theprices necessary toencourage its
expansion tosupply thisdemand.” And soon.Everyone
asconsumer buys ahundred different products; asproducer
hemakes, usually, only one.Hecanseetheinequity in
i, holding down theprice ofthat.And just aseachmanu-
136 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
facturer wants ahigher price forhisparticular product, so
eachworker wants ahigher wage orsalary. Each cansee
asproducer thatprice control isrestricting production in
hisline.Butnearly everyone refuses togeneralize this
observation, for itmeans thathewillhave topaymore for
theproducts ofothers.
Each oneofus,inbrief, hasamultiple economic per-
sonality. Each oneofusisproducer, taxpayer, consumer.
The policies headvocates depend upon theparticular aspect
under which hethinks ofhimself atthemoment. Forheis
sometimes Dr.Jekyll andsometimes Mr.Hyde. Asapro-
ducer hewants inflation (thinking chiefly ofhisown serv-
icesorproduct); asaconsumer hewants price ceilings
(thinking chiefly ofwhathehastopayfortheproducts
ofothers). Asaconsumer hemayadvocate oracquiesce
'Insubsidies; asataxpayer hewillresent paying them. Each
person islikely tothink thathecansomanage thepolitical
forces thathecanbenefit from thesubsidy more thanhe
losesfrom thetax,orbenefit from ariseforhisownproduct
(while hisrawmaterial costs arelegally helddown) and
atthesame time benefit asaconsumer from price control.
Buttheoverwhelming majority willbedeceiving them-
selves. Fornotonlymust there beatleast asmuch lossas
gainfrom thispolitical manipulation ofprices; theremust
beagreat dealmore lossthan gain, because price-fixing
discourages anddisrupts emplo3mient andproduction.
CHAPTER XVIII
MINIMUM WAGE LAWS
WEHAVE already seensome oftlieharmful results of
arbitarbitrary governmental efforts toraise theprice of
favored commodities. Thesame sortofharmful results fol-
lows efforts toraisewages through minimum wage laws.
Thisought nottobesurprising; forawage is,infact,a
price. Itisunfortunate forclarity ofeconomic thinking
thattheprice oflabor sservices should have received an
entirely different name from other prices. This haspre-
vented most people from recognizing thatthesame prin-
ciples govern both.
Thinking hasbecome soemotional and sopolitically
biased onthesubject ofwages thatinmost discussions of
them theplainest principles areignored. People whowould
beamong the firsttodeny thatprosperity could bebrought
about byartificially boosting prices, people whowould be
among the firsttopoint outthatminimum price lawsmight
bemostharmful tothevery industries theywere designed
tohelp, willnevertheless advocate minimum wage laws,
anddenounce opponents ofthem, without misgivings.
Yet itought tobeclear thataminimum wage law is,at
best, alimited weapon foi;combatting theeviloflowwages,
andthatthepossible good tobeachieved bysuch alaw
137ii
im
JmM'I
I
ECONOMICS INONELESSON
canexceed thepossible harm only inproportion asitsaims
aremodest. Themore ambitious such alaw is,thelarger
thenumber ofworkers itattempts tocover, andthemore
itattempts toraise their wages, themore likely are its
harmful effects toexceed itsgood effects.
The firstthing thathappens, forexamplejwhen alaw
ispassed thatnoone shallhepaid lessthan$30 fora
forty-hour week isthatnoonewho isnotworth $30a
week toanemployer willbeemployed atall.Youcannot
make amanworth agiven amount bymaking itillegal
foranyone toofferhimanything less.Youmerely deprive
himoftheright toearn theamount that hisabilities and
situation would permit him toearn, while youdeprive the
community even ofthemoderate services thatheiscapable
ofrendering. Inbrief, foralowwageyousubstitute unem-
ployment. Youdoharm allaround, withnocomparable
compensation.
The only exception tothisoccurs when agroup of
workers isreceiving awage actually below itsmarket worth.
This islikely tohappen only inspecial circumstances or
localities where competitive forces donotoperate freely or
adequately; butnearly allthese fecial cases could be
remedied just aseffectively, more flexibly andwith far
lesspotential harm, byunionization.
Itmaybethought that ifthelawforces thepayment of
ahigher wage inagiven industry, thatindustry canthen
charge higher prices for itsproduct, sothattheburden
ofpaying fhehigher wage ismerely shifted toconsumers.
Sudi shifts, however, arenot easily made, norarethe
MINIMUM WAGE LAWS 139
consequences ofartificial wage-ra^^^ soeasily escaped. A
higher price fortheproduct maynothepossible: itmay
merely drive consumers tosome substitute. Or, ifcon-
sumers continue tobuytheproduct oftheindustry in
which wages havebeen raised, thehigher price willcause
them tobuy lessofit.While some workers intheindustry
willbebenefited from thehigher wage, therefore, others
willbethrown outofemployment altogether. Onthe
other hand, iftheprice oftheproduct isnotraised, mar-
ginal producers intheindustry willbedriven outofbusi-
ness; sothatreduced production andconsequent unemploy-
ment willmerely bebrought about inanother way.
When such consequences arepointed out, there area
group ofpeople who reply: ^Very well; ifitistruethatthe
Xindustry cannot exist except bypaying starvation wages,
then itwillbejust aswell iftheminimum wage puts it
outofexistence altogether/^ But thisbrave pronouncement
overlooks the realities. Itoverlooks, first ofall,thatcon-
sumers will sujffer thelossofthatproduct. Itforgets, in
thesecond place, that itismerely condemning the
whoworked inthatindustry tounemployment. And
ignores, finally, thatbadaswere thewages paid inthe
industry, theywere thebestamong allthealternatives
thatseemed open totheworkers inthatindustry; otherwise
theworkers would havegone intoanother. If,
theXindustry isdriven outofexistence byaminimum
wage law,then theworkers previously employed inthat
industry willbeforced toturn toalternative courses

140 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
competition forjobs willdrivedown thepayoffered even
inthese alternative occupations. Tbere isnoescape from
theconclusion thattheminimum wage willincrease unem-
plo3raient.
Aniceproblem, moreover, willberaised bytherelief
program designed totakecareoftheunemployment caused
bytheminimum wage law.Byaminimum wage of,say,75
cents anhour,wehave forbidden anyone towork forty
hours inaweek forlessthan $30.Suppose, now,weoffer
only$18aweekonrelief. Thismeans thatwehave for-
bidden aman tobeusefully employed at,say$25aweek,
inorder thatwemaysupport him at$18aweek inidleness.
Wehave deprived society ofthevalue ofhisservices. We
havedeprived themanoftheindependence andself-respect
thatcome from self-support, even atalow level, andfrom
performing wanted work, atthesame time aswehave low-
eredwhat themancould have received byhisovwi efforts.
These consequences follow aslong asthereliefpayment
MINIMUM WAGE LAWS I4I
work foronly$10aweek—^fortheycangettherestwith-
outdoing anything
Itmayhethought thatwecanescape these consequences
Byoffering^work relief^ instead of''home relief'; butwe
merely change thenature oftheconsequences. "Work
relief" means thatwearepaying thebeneficiaries morethan
theopenmarket would paythem fortheir eiEForts, Only part
oftheir relief-wage isfortheir efforts, therefore (inwork
often ofdoubtful utility), while therest isadisguised dole.
Itwould probably havebeen better allaround ifthe
government inthe firstplacehadfrankly subsidized their
wages ontheprivate work theywere already doing.We
need notpursue thispoint further, asitwould carry us
intoproblems notimmediately relevant. Butthedifficulties
andconsequences ofreliefmustbekept inmindwhenwe
consider theadoption ofminimum wage lawsoranincrease
inminimums already fixed.
Allthis isnottoargue thatthere isnoway ofraising
wages. Itismerely topoint outthattheapparently easy
method ofraising them bygovernment fiat isthewrong
wayandtheworst way.
This isperhaps asgood aplace asanytopoint outthat
what distinguishes many reformers from thosewhocannot
accept their proposals isnottheir greater philanthropy, but
their greater impatience. Thequestion isnotwhether we
wish toseeeverybody aswell offaspossible: Among men

ofgood willsuchanaimcanhetaken forgranted. The
realquestion concerns theproper means ofachieving it
And intrying toanswer thiswemust never losesight ofa
fewelementary truisms.Wecannot distribute more wealth
than iscreated.Wecannot inthelongrunpaylabor asa
whole more than itproduces.
The bestway toraisewages, therefore, istoraise labor
productivity. Thiscanbedonebymany methods: byan
increase incapital accumulation— i.e.,byanincrease inthe
machines withwhich theworkers areaided; bynewinven-
tionsandimprovements; bymore efficient management on
thepartofemployers; bymore industriousness andefficiency
onthepartofworkers; bybetter education and training.
Themore theindividual worker produces, themorehein-
creases thewealth ofthewhole community. Themorehe
produces, themore hisservices areworth toconsumers,
andhence toemployers. And themoreheisworth toem-
ployers, themorehewill ]bepaid. Realwages come outof
production, notoutofgovernment decrees.
CHAPTER XIX
DOUNIONS REALLY RAISE
WAGES?
T^hepower oflabor unions toraisewages overthelong
runandforthewhole working population hasbeen
enormously exaggerated. This exaggeration ismainly the
result offailure torecognize thatwages arebasically deter-
mined bylabor productivity. Itisforthis reason, for
example, thatwages intheUnited States were incompa-
rably higher thanwages inEngland andGermany alldur-
ingthedecades when the'labor movement^^ inthelatter
twocountries was farmore advanced.
Inspite oftheoverwhelming evidence that labor pro-
ductivity isthefundamental determinant ofwages, the
conclusion isusually forgotten orderided bylabor union
leaders andbythat large group ofeconomic writers who
seekareputation as'liberals” byparroting them. But this
conclusion doesnotrestontheassumption, astheysuppose,
thatemployers areuniformly kindandgenerous meneager
todowhat isright. Itrestsonthevery different assumption
thattheindividual employer iseager toincrease hisown
profits tothemaximum. Ifpeople arewilling towork for
lessthan they arereally worth tohim,whyshould henot
take thefullest advantage ofthis?Why should henot
143
144 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
prefer, forexample, tomake $iaweek outofaworkman
rather than seesome other employer make $2aweek out
ofhim?And aslong asthissituation exists, there willbea
tendency foremployers tohidworkers uptotheir full
economic worth.
Allthisdoesnotmeaii thatunions canservenouseful
orlegitimate function. The central function they can
serve istoassure that alloftheirmembers getthetrue
market value oftheir services.
Forthecompetition ofworkers forjobs,andofemployers
forworkers, doesnotwork* perfectly. Neither individual
workers norindividual employers arelikely tobefully
informed concerning theconditions ofthelabor market.
Anindividual worker, without thehelp ofaunion ora
knowledge of“union rates,”maynotknow thetruemarket
value ofhisservices toanemployer. Andheis,individually,
inamuch weaker bargaining position. Mistakes ofjudg-
ment arefarmore costly tohimthan toanemployer. Ifan
employer mistakenly refuses tohire amanfromwhose
services hemight have profited, hemerely loses thenet
profit hemight havemade fromemplo)nng thatoneman;
andhemayemploy ahundred orathousand men.But if
aworker mistakenly refuses ajobinthebelief thathecan
easily get.another that willpayhimmore, theerrormay
costhim dear. Hiswhole means oflivelihood isinvolved.
Notonlymayhefailpromptly tofindanother joboffering
more; hemay failforatime tofindanother joboffering
remotely asmuch. And timemaybetheessence ofhis
problem, because heandhisfamily must eat.Sohemay
DOUNIONS REALDY RAISE WAGES? I45
betempted totakeawage thatheknows tobebelow his
^realworth^^ rather than face these risks*When anem-
ployers workers dealwithhim asabody, however, and
setaknown ^'standard wage^^ foragiven class of.work,
theymayhelp toequalize bargaining power andtherisks
involved inmistakes.
But itiseasy, asexperience hasproved, forunions,
particularly with thehelp ofone-sided labor legislation
which putscompulsions solely onemployers, togobeyond
their legitimate functions, toactirresponsibly, and toem-
brace short-sighted and anti-social policies. They dothis,
forexample, whenever theyseek tofixthewages oftheir
members above their realmarket worth. Such anattempt
always brings about unemployment. Thearrangement can
bemade tostick, infact,onlybysomeform ofintimidation
orcoercion.
Onedevice consists inrestricting themembership ofthe
union onsome other basis than thatofproved competence
orskill.This restriction maytakemany forms: itmaycon-
sistincharging newworkers excessive initiation fees; in
arbitrary membership qualifications; indiscrimination, open
orconcealed, ongrounds ofreligion, raceorsex;insome
absolute limitation onthenumber ofmembers, orinexclu-
sion,byforce ifnecessary, notonly oftheproducts ofnon-
union labor, butoftheproducts even ofaffiliated unions
inother States orcities.
Themost obvious case inwhich^ intimidation andforce
areused toputorkeep thewages ofaparticular union
above therealmarket worth ofitsmembers services isKill
'•

thatofastrike.Apeaceful strike ispossible. Totheextent
that itremains peaceful, itisalegitimate laborw
eventhough itisonethatshould beused rarely andasa
last resort. Ifhisworkers asabody withhold their labor,
theymaybring astubborn eniployer, whohasbeen under-
paying them, tohissenses.Hemay find thatheisunable
toreplace these workers byworkers equally goodwho are
willing toaccept thewage that theformer havenow
rejected. Butthemoment workers have touseintimidation
orviolence toenforce theirdemands—-themoment theyuse
pickets toprevent anyoftheoldworkers from continuing
attheir jobs, ortoprevent theemployer from hiring new
permanent workers totake theirplaces— their casebecomes
questionable. Forthepickets arereally being used, not
primarily against theemployer, butagainst other workers.
These other workers arewilling totakethejobs thatthe
oldemployes have vacated, and atthewages thattheold
employes now reject.The factproves thattheother alter-
natives open tothenewworkers arenotasgood asthose
thattheoldemployes have refused. If,therefore, theold
employes succeed byforce inpreventing newworkers from
taking their place, theyprevent thesenewworkers from
choosing thebestalternative open tothem, andforcethem
totakesomething worse. The strikers aretherefore insist-
ingonaposition ofprivilege, andareusing force tomain-
tain thisprivileged position against other workers.
Iftheforegoing analysis iscorrect, theindiscriminate
hatred ofthe^strikebreaker*^ isnot justified. Ifthestrike-
breakers consist merely ofprofessional thugswhothemselves

threaten violence, orwhocannot infact <dothewort, orif
they arebeing paid atemporarily higher rate solely forthe
purpose ofmaking apretense ofcarrying onuntil theold
workers arefrightened back towork attheoldrates, the
hatredmaybewarranted. But iftheyareinfactmerely men
andwomen who arelooking forpermanent jobsandwilling
toaccept them attheold rate, then they areworkers
whowould beshoved intoworse jobsthan these inorder
toenable thestriking workers toenjoy better ones.And
thissuperior position fortheoldemployes could continue
tobemaintained, infact,onlybytheever-present threat
offorce.
Emotional economics hasgiven birth totheories that
calmexamination cannot justify. One ofthese istheidea
thatlabor isbeing'underpaid^' generally. Thiswould be
analogous tothenotion that itiafreemarket prices in
general arechronically toolow.Another curious butper-
sistent notion isthattheinterests ofanation sworkers are
identical with each other, and thatanincrease inwages
foroneunion insome obscure wayhelps allother workers.
Notonly istherenotruth inthisidea; thetruth isthat, if
aparticular union bycoercion isable toenforce foritsown
members awage substantially above therealmarket worth
oftheir services, itwillhurt allother workers asithurts
othermembers ofthecommunity.
Inorder toseemore clearly how this occurs, letus
imagine acommunity inwhich thefacts areenormously
1
11'
II
f'j.lI4S ECONOMICS INONELESSON
simplified arithmetically* Suppose thecommunity consisted
ofjusthalfadozen groups ofworkers/ andthatthese groups
were originally equal toeach other intheir totalwages and
themarket value oftheir product.
Letussaythatthese sixgroups ofworkers consist of(i)
farm hands, (2) retail store workers, (3)workers inthe
clothing trades, (4)coalminers, (5)building workers, and
(6)railway employes. Their wage rates, determined with-
outanyelement ofcoercion, arenotnecessarily equal; but
whatever they are, letusassign toeach ofthemanoriginal
indexnumber of100asabase.Now letussuppose that
eachgroup forms anational union and isable toenforce
itsdemands inproportion notmerely toitseconomic pro-
ductivity but toitspolitical power and strategic position.
Suppose theresult isthat thefarmhands areunable to
raise theirwages atall,thatthe retail store workers are
able togetanincrease of10percent, theclothing workers
of20percent, thecoalminers of30percent, thebuilding
trades of40percent,andtherailroad employes of50per
cent.
Ontheassumptions wehavemade, thiswillmean that
there hasbeenanaverage increase inwages of25percent.
Now suppose, again forthesakeofarithmetical simplicity,
thattheprice oftheproduct thateachgroup ofworkers
makes risesbythesame percentage astheincrease inthat
group's wages, (For several reasons, including thefactthat
labor costsdonotrepresent allcosts, theprice willnot
quite dothat—certainly notinanyshort period. Butthe
figures willnone thelessserve toillustrate thebasic prin-
ciple involved.)
DOUNIONS REALLY RAISE WAGES? 14^
Weshall tlienhave asituation inwhich thecostofliving
hasrisenbyanaverage of25percent.Thefarm hands,
though theyhavehadnoreduction intheirmoney wages,
willbeconsiderably worse offinterms ofwhat theycan
buy.The retail store workers, eventhough theyhave got
anincrease inmoney wages oflopercent, willbeworse
oflFthan before theracebegan. Even theworkers inthe
clothing trades, with amoney-wage increase of20percent,
willbeatadisadvantage compared with their previous
position. The coalminers, with amoney-wage increase of
30percent, willhavemade inpurchasing power onlya
slight gain.Thebuilding andrailroad workers willofcourse
havemade again, butonemuch smaller inactuality than
inappearance.
Buteven such calculations restontheassumption that
theforced increase inwages hasbrought about nounem-
plo)mient. This islikely tobetrueonly iftheincrease in
wages hasbeenaccompanied byanequivalent increase in
money andbank credit; andeven then itisimprobable
thatsuch distortions inwage rates canbebrought about
without creating pockets ofunemployment, particularly in
thetrades inwhich wages haveadvanced themost. Ifthis
corresponding monetary inflation doesnotoccur, theforced
wage advances willbring about widespread unemployment.
Theunemployment need notnecessarily begreatest, in
percentage terms, among theunions whose wages havebeen
advanced themost; forunemployment willbeshifted and
distributed inrelation totherelative elasticity ofthedemand
fordifferent kinds oflaborandinrelation tothe'pint”
nature ofthedemand formany kinds oflabor. Yetwhen
150 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
allthese allowances havebeenmade, even thegroups whose
wages have been advanced themost willprobably be
found, when theirunemployed areaveraged with their
employed members, tobeworse offthan before. And in
terms ofwelfare, ofcourse, thelosssuffered willbemuch
greater than thelossinmerely arithmetical terms, because
thepsychological losses ofthosewho areunemployed will
greatly outweigh thepsychological gains ofthose with a
slightly higher income interms ofpurchasing power.
Norcanthesituation berectified byproviding unem-
ployment relief. Such relief, inthe first place, ispaid for
inlarge part, directly orindirectly, outofthewages ofthose
who work. Ittherefore reduces these wages. ^^Adequate/^
relief payments, moreover, aswehave already seen, create
unemployment. They dosoinseveral ways.When strong
labor unions inthepastmade ittheir function toprovide
fortheirownunemployed members, theythought twice
before demanding awage thatwould cause heavy unem-
ployment. Butwhere there isarelief system under which
thegeneral taxpayer isforced toprovide fortheunem-
ployment caused byexcessive wage rates, this restraint on
excessive union demands isremoved. Moreover, aswehave
already noted, ^adequate ^relief willcause somemen not
toseekwork atall,and willcause others toconsider that
they areineffect being asked towork notforthewage
offered, butonly forthedifference between thatwageand
therelief payment. Andheavy unemployment means that
fewer goods areproduced, thatthenation ispoorer, and
thatthere islessforeverybody.
BOUNIONS REALLT RAISE WAGES? I5I
The apostles ofsalvation hyunionism sometimes attempt
another answer totheproblem Ihave justpresented. It
maybetrue, they willadmit, thatthemembers ofstrong
unions today exploit, among others, thenon-unionized
workers; buttheremedy issimple: unionize everybody.
Theremedy, however, isnotquite thatsimple. Inthe first
place, inspite oftheenormous political encouragements
(onemight insome cases saycompulsions) tounioniza-
tionunder theWagner Actandother laws, itisnotan
accident thatonlyabout afourth ofthisnation sgainfully
employed workers areunionized. Theconditions propitious
tounionization aremuch more special than generally rec-
ognized. Buteven ifuniversal unionization could be
achieved, theunions could notpossibly beequally power-
ful,anymore than they aretoday. Some groups ofwork-
ersareinafarbetter strategic position than others, either
because ofgreater numbers, ofthemore essential nature
oftheproduct theymake, ofthegreater dependence on
their industry ofother industries, oroftheir greater ability
tousecoercive methods. Butsuppose thiswere notso?
Suppose, inspite oftheself-contradictoriness ofthe as-
sumption, that allworkers bycoercive methods could raise
theirwages byanequal percentage? Nobody would be
anybetter off,inthelongrun,than ifwages hadnotbeen
raised atall.
,3
This leads ustotheheart ofthequestion. Itisusually
assumed thatanincrease inwages isgained attheexpense
152 ECONO^MICS INONELESSON
oftheprofits ofemployers. Thismay ofcourse happen for
short periods orinspecial circumstances. Ifwages are
forced upinaparticular firm, insuch competition with
others that itcannot raise itsprices, theincrease willcome
outofitsprofits. This ismuch lesslikely tohappen, how-
ever, ifthewage increase takes place throughout awhole
industry. Theindustry willinmost cases increase itsprices
andpassthewage increase along toconsumers. Asthese
arelikely toconsist forthemost partofworkers, they will
simply have their realwages reduced byhaving topaymore
foraparticular product. Itistruethat asaresult ofthe,in-
creased prices, sales ofthat industry sproducts may fall
off,sothatvolume ofprofits intheindustry willbere-
duced; butemployment and total payrolls intheindustry
arelikely tobereduced byacorresponding amount.
Itispossible, nodoubt, toconceive ofacase inwhich
theprofits inawhole industry arereduced without any
corresponding reduction inemployment—acase, inother
words, inwhich anincrease inwage ratesmeans acorres-
ponding increase inpayrolls, andinwhich thewhole cost
comes outoftheindustry s.profits without throwing any
firmoutofbusiness. Such aresult isnot likely, but itis
conceivable.
Suppose wetakeanindustry likethatoftherailroads,

with their average wages at67cents anhour; and ithad
fallen further to699,000 in1938 with average wages at
74cents anhour. Butwecanforthesake ofargument
overlook actualities forthemoment andtalkasifwewere
discussing ahypothetical case.)
Itisatleast possible forunions tomake their gains in
theshortrun attheexpense ofemployers and investors.
The investors oncehad liquid funds. Buttheyhave put
them, say,into therailroad business. They have turned
them into railsandroadbeds, freight carsandlocomotives.
Once their capital might havebeen turned intoanyofa
thousand forms, buttoday itistrapfed, sotospeak, inone
particular form.Therailway unions may forcethem toac-
ceptsmaller returns onthiscapital already invested. Itwill
paytheinvestors tocontinue .running therailroad ifthey
canearnanything atallabove operating expenses, even
ifitisonly one-tenth ofipercentontheir investment.
Butthere isaninevitable corollary ofthis. Ifthemoney
thattheyhave invested inrailroads now yields lessthan
money theycaninvest inother lines, theinvestors willnot
putacentmore into railroads. Theymay replace afewof
thethings thatwear out first, toprotect thesmall yieldon
theirremaining capital; hutinthelongrunthey willnot
even bother toreplace items that fallintoobsolescence or
decay. Ifcapital invested athome paysthem lessthan that
invested abroad, they will invest abroad. Iftheycannot^ I

find sufficient return anywhere tocompensate them for
their risk,they willcease toinvest atall.
Thus theexploitation ofcapital hylabor can atBest
bemerely temporary. Itwillquickly come toanend. It
willcome toanend, actually, notsomuch intheway in-
dicated inourhypothetical illustration, asbytheforcing
ofmarginal firms outofbusiness entirely, thegrowth of
unemployment, andtheforced readjustment ofwages and
profits tothepointwhere theprospect ofnormal (orath
normal) profits leads toaresumption ofemployment and
production. Butinthemeanwhile, asaresult oftheex-
ploitation, unemployment andreduced production will
havemade everybody poorer. Even though labor fora
time willhave agreater relative share ofthenational in-
come, thenational income will fall absolutely; sothat
labors relative gains inthese short periods maymean a
Pyrrhic victory: theymaymean that labor, too, isgetting
alower totalamount interms ofrealpurchasing power.

Thuswearedriven totheconclusion thatunions, though
theymay foratimebeable tosecure anincrease inmoney
wages fortheirmembers, partly attheexpense ofemploy-
ersandmore attheexpense ofnon-unionized workers, do
not,inthelong-run andforthewhole hody ofworkers,

which sees theenomous riseinwages inthe lasthalf
century, dueprincipally tothegrowth ofcapital invest-
mentand toscientific andtechnological advance, and as-
cribes ittotheunions because theunions were alsogrow-
ingduring this period. Buttheerror most responsible
forthedelusion isthatofconsidering merely what arise
ofwages brought about byunion demands means inthe
shortrunfortheparticular workers who retain their jobs,
while failing totrace theeffects ofthisadvance onemploy-
ment, production andtheliving costs ofallworkers, in-
cluding thosewhoforced theincrease.
Onemaygofurther than thisconclusion, and raise the
question whether unions have not,inthelongrunand
forthewhole body ofworkers, actually prevented real
wages from rising totheextent towhich they otherwise
might have risen.They have certainly been aforceworking
toholddown ortoreduce wages iftheir effect, onnetbal-
ance,hasbeen toreduce labor productivity; andwemayask
whether ithasnotbeen so.
With regard toproductivity there issomething tobesaid
forunion policies, itistrue,onthecredit side. Insome
trades theyhave insisted onstandards toincrease thelevel
ofskillandcompetence. And intheir early history they
didmuch toprotect thehealth oftheirmembers. Where
labor was plentiful, individual employers often stood to
gainbyspeeding upworkers andworking them- longhours
inspite ofultimate illeffects upon their health, because
theycould easily bereplaced with others. Andsometimes
ignorant orshortsighted employers would even reduce
156 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
theirown profits byoverworking their employes. Inall
these cases theunions, bydemanding decent standards,
often increased thehealth andbroader welfare oftheir
members atthesame time asthey increased their real
wages.
Butinrecent years, astheirpower hasgrown, and as
much misdirected public sympathy hasledtoatolerance
orendorsement ofanti-social practices, unions havegone
beyond their legitimate goals. Itwasa^gain, notonly to
health andwelfare, buteven inthelongrun toproduc-
tion, toreduce aseventy-hour week toasixty-hour week.
Itwasagain tohealth and leisure toreduce asixty-hour
week toaforty-eight hour week. Itwasagain toleisure,
butnotnecessarily toproduction andincome, toreduce
aforty-eight-hour week toaforty-four-hour week. The
value tohealth andleisure ofreducing theworking week
toforty hours ismuch less, thereduction inoutput and
income more clear. Buttheunions now talk,andoften
enforce, thirty-five and thirty-hour weeks, anddeny that
these canorshould reduce output orincome.
But itisnotonly inreducing scheduled working hours
thatunion policy hasworked against productivity. That, in
fact, isoneoftheleastharmful ways inwhich ithasdone
so;forthecompensating gain, atleast, hasbeen clear.But
many unions have insisted onrigid subdivisions oflabor
which have raised production costsandledtoexpensive
andridiculous "jurisdictionar' disputes. They haveopposed
payment onthebasis ofoutput oreflSciency, and insisted
onthesame hourly rates foralltheirmembers regardless

ofdifferences inproductivity. Tliey have insisted onpro-
motion forseniority rather than formerit They have in-
itiated deliberate slowdowns under thepretense offight-
ing^speed-ups/^ They havedenounced, insisted upon the
dismissal of,andsometimes cruelly beaten, menwho
turned outmorework than their fellows. They have op-
posed theintroduction orimprovement ofmachinery. They
have insisted onmake-work rules torequire more people
ormore time toperform agiven task.They have even in-
sisted, with thethreat ofruining employers, onthehiring
ofpeoplewho arenotneeded atall.
Most ofthese policies havebeen followed under the as-
sumption thatthere isjustafixedamount ofwork tobe
done, adefinite 'job fund’^ which hastobespread over
asmany people andhours aspossible soasnot touse it
uptoosoon. This assumption isutterly false. There is
actually nolimit totheamount ofwork tobedone.Work
creates work.WhatAproduces constitutes thedemand for
whatBproduces.
Butbecause this false assumption exists, andbecause
thepolicies ofimions arebased on it,their neteffect has
been toreduce productivity below what itwould other-
wisehave been. Their neteffect, therefore, inthelongrun
andforallgroups ofworkers, hasbeen toreduce realwages—that is,wages interms ofthegoods they willbuy—
below thelevel towhich theywould otherwise have risen.
The realcause forthetremendous increase inrealwages
inthelasthalfcentury (especially inAmerica) hasbeen, to

repeat, theaccumulation ofcapital andtheenormous tech-
nological advance made possible by it.
Reduction oftherateofincrease inrealwages isnot,
ofcourse, aconsequence inherent inthenature ofunions.
Ithasbeen theresult ofshortsighted policies. There is
stilltime tochange them.
CHAPTER XX
NOUGHTOBUYBACKTHE
PRODUCT’
Amateur writers oneconomics arealways asking for
^pst” prices and*just^’ wages. These nebulous con-
ceptions ofeconomic justice comedown tousfrommedie-
valtimes.The classical economists worked out, instead, a
diflFerent concept—theconcept offunctional prices and
functional wages. Functional prices arethose thatencour-
agethelargest volume ofproduction andthelargest volume
ofsales. Functional wages arethose thattend tobring
about thehighest volume ofemployment andthelargest
payrolls.
Theconcept offunctional wages hasbeen taken over,
inaperverted form,bytheMarxists andtheir unconscious
disciples, thepurchasing-power school. Both ofthese
groups leave tocruder minds thequestion whether exist-
ingwages are ^'fair.’' The real question, they insist, is
whether ornotthey willwork.And theonlywages that
willwork, they tellus,theonlywages that willprevent
animminent economic crash, arewages that willenable
labor ''tobuyback theproduct itcreates.’^ The Marxist
andpurchasing-power schools attribute every depression
ofthepast toapreceding failure topaysuch wages. And
ECONOMICS INONELESSON
atnomatter whatmoment they speak, they aresure that
wages are stillnothighenough tohuyback theproduct
The doctrine hasproved particularly effective inthe
hands ofunion leaders. Despairing oftheir ability toarouse
thealtruistic interest ofthepublic ortopersuade employ-
ers(wicked bydefinition) ever tobe Affair, theyhave
seized uponanargument calculated toappeal tothepub-
lic's selfish motives, andfrighten itinto forcing empldy-
erstogrant theirdemands.
How arewetoknow, however, precisely when labor
doeshave ^^enough tobuyback theproduct^7Orwhen
ithasmore thanenough? How arewetodetermine just
what therightsum is?Asthechampions ofthedoctrine
donotseem tohavemade anyclear effort toanswer such
questions, weareobliged totrytofind theanswers for
ourselves.
Some sponsors ofthetheory seem toimply that the
workers ineach industry should receive enough tobuy
back theparticular product theymake. Butthey surely
cannot mean thatthemakers ofcheap dresses should have
enough tobuybackcheap dresses andthemakers ofmink
coatsenough tobuybackmink coats; orthatthemen in
theFord plant should receive enough tobuyFords and
themen intheCadillac plant enough tobuy Cadillacs.
Itisinstructive torecall, however, thattheunions in
theautomobile industry, atatimewhen most oftheirmem-
berswere already intheupper third ofthecountry's in-
come receivers, andwhen their weekly wage, according
togovernment figures, wasalready 20percent higher
than theaverage wage paid infactories andnearly twice
ENOUGH TOBUYBAOKTHEPRODUCT. l6l
asgreat astheaverage paid inretail trade, weredemanding
a30percent increase sothatthey might, according to
oneoftheirspokesme /^holster ourfast-shrinking ability
toabsorb thegoods which wehave thecapacity topro-
duce/^
What, then, oftheaverage factory worker andtheaver-
age retail worker? If,under such circumstances, theauto-
mobile workers needed a30percent increase tokeep the
economy from collapsing, would amere 30percenthave
beenenough fortheothers? Orwould theyhave required
increases of55to160percent togivethem asmuch per
capita purchasing power astheautomobile workers? (We
maybesure, ifthehistory ofwage bargaining evenwithin
ifidividwl unions isanyguide, thattheautomobile work-
ers,ifthislastproposal hadbeenmade, would have insisted
onthemaintenance oftheir existing differentials; forthe
passion foreconomic equality, among union members as
among therestofus, is,with theexception ofafewrare
philanthropists and saints, apassion forgetting asmuch
asthose above USintheeconomic scale already getrather
than apassion forgiving those below usasmuch aswe
ourselves already get.But itiswith thelogicandsound-
ness ofaparticular economic theory, rather than with
these distressing weaknesses ofhuman nature, thatweare
atpresent concerned.)
Theargument that labor should receive enough tobuy
back theproduct ismerely aspecial form ofthegeneral
'purchasing power ^argument. The workers^ wages, itis
102 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
correctly enough contended, aretheworters^ purchasing
power. But itisjustastrue that everyone^s income— the
grocers, thelandlords, theemployers—ishispurchasing
power forbuying what others have tosell.Andoneofthe
most important things forwhich others have tofindpur-
chasers istheir labor services.
All this,moreover, has itsreverse side.Inanexchange
economy everybody sincome issomebody else^s cost.Every
increase inhourly wages, unless oruntil compensated by
anequal increase inhourly productivity, isanincrease in
costs ofproduction. Anincrease incosts ofproduction,
where thegovernment controls prices andforbids anyprice
increase, takes theprofit from marginal producers, forces
diem outofbusiness, means ashrinkage inproduction and
agrowth inunemployment. Even where aprice increase
ispossible, thehigher price discourages buyers, shrinks
themarket, and alsoleads tounemployment. Ifa30per
cent increase inhourly wages allaround thecircle forces
a30percent increase inprices, labor canbuynomore of
theproduct than itcould atthebeginning; andthemerry-
go-round must start allover again.
Nodoubtmany willbeinclined todispute theconten-
tionthata30percent increase inwages canforce asgreat
apercentage increase inprices. Itistrue that this result
canfollow only inthelongrunandonly ifmonetary and
credit policy permit it.Ifmoney andcredit aresoinelastic
thattheydonotincrease when wages areforced up(and
Ifweassume thatthehigher wages arenotjustified by
existing labor productivity indollar terms), then thechief
'^ENOUGH TOBUYBACKTHEBRODUGT'^ 163
effect offorcing upwage rates willbetoforce unemploy-
ment.
And itisprobable, inthat case, that total payrolls, both
indollar amount and inrealpurchasing power, willbe
lower than before. Foradrop inemployment (brought
about byunion policy andnotasatransitional result of
technological advance) necessarily means thatfewer goods
arebeing produced foreveryone. And itisunlikely that
labor willcompensate fortheabsolute drop inproduction
bygetting alarger relative share oftheproduction that is
left.ForPaulH.Douglas inAmerica andA.C.Pigou in
England, the firstfrom analyzing agreatmass ofstatistics,
thesecond byalmost purely deductive methods, arrived
independently attheconclusion thattheelasticity ofthe
demand forlabor issomewhere between—3and—4.This
means, 4nlesstechnical language, that% ipercent re-
duction inthereal rateofwage islikely toexpand the
aggregate demand forlaborbynotlessthan3per cent.^^^
Or,toputthematter theother way, ^Ifwages arepushed
upabove thepoint ofmarginal productivity, thedecrease
inemployment would normally befrom three tofourtimes
asgreat astheincrease inhourly rates'^^ sothatthetotal
income oftheworkers would bereduced correspondingly.
Even ifthese figures aretaken torepresent only the
elasticity ofthedemand forlabor revealed inagiven period
ofthepast,andnotnecessarily toforecast thatofthefuture,
they deserve themost serious consideration.

164 BCOHOMICS INONELESSON
'3
Butnow letussuppose thattheincrease inwage rates
isaccompanied orfollowed byasufiicient increase in
money andcredit toallow ittotakeplace without creating
serious unemployment* Ifweassume thattheprevious re-
lationship between wages andprices was itself a^^normaF*
long-run relationship, then itisaltogether probable that
aforced increase of,say,30percent inwage rates will
ultimately lead toanincrease inprices ofapproximately
thesame percentage.
The belief thattheprice increase would besubstantially
lessthan that restsontwomain fallacies. The first isthat
oflooldng only atthedirect labor costs ofaparticular firm
orindustry andassuming these torepresent allthelabor
costs involved. But this istheelementary error ofmistak-
ingapart forthewhole. Each^industry^^ represents not
only justonesection oftheproductive process considered
‘horizontally,'^ butjustonesection ofthatprocess consid-
ered “vertically." Thus thedirect labor costofmaking auto-
mobiles intheautomobile factories themselves maybeless
than athird, say,ofthetotal costs;and thismayleadthe
incautious toconclude thata30percent increase inwages
would lead toonlya10percent increase, orless, inauto-
mobile prices. But thiswould betooverlook theindirect
wage costs intherawmaterials andpurchased parts, in
transportation charges, innew factories ornewmachine
tools, orinthedealers' mark-up.
Government estimates show thatinthefifteen-year period
T
“enough tobuybacktheproduct” 165
from 1929 to1943, inclusive, wages and salaries inthe
United States averaged 69percentofthenational income.
These wages and salaries, ofcourse, had tobepaidout
ofthenational product. While therewould have tobe
both deductions from this figure andadditions toitto
provide afairestimate of“labor's” income, wecanassume
onthisbasis thatlabor costscannot belessthanabout two-
thirds oftotalproduction costsandmayrunabove three-
quarters (depending upon ourdefinition of“labor”). If,
wetakethelower ofthesetwoestimates, andassume also
that dollar profit margins would beunchanged, itisclear
thatanincrease of30percent inwage costs allaround
thecirclewould mean anincrease ofnearly 20percent
inprices.
Butsuch achange would mean thatthedollar profit
margin, representing theincome ofinvestors, managers
andtheself-employed, would then have, say,only84per
cent asmuch purchasing power asithadbefore. The long-
run eflFect ofthiswould betocause adiminution ofinvest-
ment andnew enterprise compared withwhat itwould
otherwise have been, andconsequent transfers ofmen
from thelower ranks oftheself-employed tothehigher
ranks ofwage-earners, until theprevious relationships had
been approximately restored. But this isonlyanother way
ofsaying thata30percent increase inwages under the
conditions assumed would eventually mean alsoa30per
cent increase inprices.
Itdoesnotnecessarily follow thatwage-earners would
makenorelative gains.They would make arelative gain.
l66 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
andother elements inthepopulation would suflFer arel-
ative loss,during theperiod oftransition. But itisim-
probable that this relative gainwould mean anabsolute
gain. Forthekind ofchange intherelationship ofcosts
toprices contemplated herecould hardly takeplace with-
outbringing about unemployment andunbalanced, inter-
rupted orreduced production. Sothatwhile labor might
getabroader slice ofasmaller pie,during thisperiod of
transition andadjustment toanew equilibrium, itmaybe
doubted whether thiswould begreater inabsolute size
Cand itmight easily beless) than theprevious narrower
slice ofalarger pie.
This brings ustothegeneral meaning and effect of
economic equilihrium. Equilibrium wages and prices are
thewages andprices thatequalize supply anddemand. If,
either through government orprivate coercion, anattempt
B'made toliftprices above their equilibrium level,demand
isreduced andtherefore production isreduced. Ifanat-
tempt ismade topush prices below their equilibrium level,
theconsequent reduction orwiping outofprofits will
mean afalling offofsupply ornewproduction. Therefore
anattempt toforce prices either above orbelow their equi-
librium levels (which arethelevels toward which afree
market constantly tends tobring them) willacttoreduceAevolume ofemployment andproduction below what
itwould otherwise have been.
Toreturn, then, tothedoctrine that labor must get
^‘enough tobuybackthepropuct"^ 167
"^enough tobuyback theproduct/^ The national product,
itshould beobvious, isneither created norbought by
manufacturing labor alone. Itisbought byeveryone—
bywhite collar workers, professional men, farmers, em-
ployers, bigand little,byinvestors, grocers, butchers, own-
ersofsmall drug stores andgasoline stations—^byevery-
body, inshort,who contributes toward making theproduct.
Astotheprices, wages and profits thatshould deter-
mine thedistribution ofthatproduct, thebest prices are
notthehighest prices, buttheprices thatencourage the
largest volume ofproduction andthelargest volume of
sales.The bestwage rates forlabor arenotthehighest
wage rates, butthewage rates thatpermit fullproduction,
fullemployment andthelargest sustained payrolls. The
best profits, from thestandpoint notonly ofindustry but
ofla^r, arenotthelowest profits, buttheprofits thaten-
rourage most people tobecome employers ortoprovide
moreemployment than before.

Theindignation shown hymany people today atthe
mention oftheveryword “profits” indicates how
littleunderstanding there isofthevitalfunction that profits
play inoureconomy. Toincrease ourunderstanding, we
shallgooveragainsome oftheground already covered in
Qiapter XIVontheprice system, butweshallview the
subject from adifferent angle.
Profits actually donotbulk large inour totaleconomy.
The netincome ofincorporated business inthe fifteen
years from 1929 to1943, totakeanillustrative figure,
averaged lessthan5percentofthetotal national income.
Yet“profits” aretheform ofincome toward which there
ismost hostility. Itissignificant thatwhile there isaword
“profiteer” tostigmatize thosewhomake allegedly exces-
siveprofits, there isnosuchword as“wageer”—or“losseer.”
Yettheprofits oftheowner ofabarber shopmayaverage

The subject isclouded byallsorts offactual miscon-
ceptions. The total profits ofGeneral Motors, thegreatest
industrial corporation intheworld, aretaken J'P TjrT£iT*/a
THEFONCTION OFPROFITS 169
typical rather than exceptional. Fewpeople areacquainted
with themortality rates forbusiness concerns. They do
notknow (toquote from theTNEC studies) that"should
conditions ofbusiness averaging theexperience ofthelast
fifty years prevail, about seven ofeach tengrocery stores
opening today will survive into their second year; only
fourofthetenmayexpect tocelebrate their fourth birth-
day.”They donotknow that inevery yearfrom 1930 to
1938, intheincome taxstatistics, thenumber ofcorpora-
tions thatshowed alossexceeded thenumber thatshowed
aprofit.
Howmuch doprofits, ontheaverage^ amount to?No
trustworthy estimate hasbeenmade thattakes intoaccount
allkinds ofactivity, unincorporated aswell asincorporated
business, andasuflGicient number ofgoodandbad years.
Butsome eminent economists believe thatoveralong

aminimum "riskless” interest oninvested capital, and for
animputed "reasonable” wage value oftheservices of
peoplewhoruntheirownbusiness, nonetprofit atallmay
beleftover,andthat theremayevenbeanet loss.This
isnotatallbecause entrepreneurs (people whogointo
business forthemselves) areintentional philanthropists,
butbecause their optimism andself-confidence toooften
leadthem intoventures thatdonotorcannot succeed.^
Itisclear, inany case, thatanyindividual placing ven-
ture capital runsarisknotonly ofearning noreturn but
oflosing hiswhole principal. Inthepast ithasbeen the

lureofhigh profits inspecial firms orindustries thathas
ledhim totake thatgreat risk.But ifprofits arelimited to
amaximum of,say,ropercent orsome similar figure,
while theriskoflosing dne^s entire capital stiU exists, what
islikely tobethe eflEectontheprofit incentive, andhence
onemployment andproduction? The wartime excess-
profits taxhasalready shown uswhat such alimitcando,
even forashort period, inundermining efficiency.
Yetgovernmental policy almost everywhere today tends
toassume thatproduction willgoonautomatically, nomat-
terwhat isdone- todiscourage it.One ofthegreatest dan-
gers toproduction today comes from government price-
fixing policies. Notonlydothese policies putoneitem
after another outofproduction byleaving noincentive
tomake it,buttheir long-run effect istoprevent abalance
ofproduction inaccordance with theactual demands of
consumers. Iftheeconomy were free,demand would so
actthatsome branches ofproduction would make what
government oiSficials would undoubtedly regard as^exces-
sive'' or'unreasonable" profits. Butthatvery factwould not
only cause every firm inthatline toexpand itsproduction
totheutmost, andtoreinvest itsprofits inmoremachinery
andmore employment; itwould also attract new investors
andproducers from everywhere, until production inthat
linewasgreatenough tomeetdemand, andtheprofits init
again felltothegeneral average level.
Inafreeeconomy, inwhich wages, costsandprices are
lefttothefreeplayofthecompetitive market, theprospect
ofprofits decides what articles willbemade, andinwhat

there isnoprofit inmaking anarticle, itisasign thatthe

cansolve thisproblem arbitrarily. Free prices and free
profits willmaximize production and relieve shortages
quicker thananyother system. Arbitrarily-fixed prices and
arbitrarily-limited profits canonly prolong shortages and
reduce production andemployment.

CHAPTERXXII
THEMIRAGE OFINFLATION
IHAVE found itnecessary towarn thereader from time
totime thatacertain result would necessarily follow
from acertain policy 'provided there isnoinflation/^ In
thechapters onpublic works andoncredit Isaid thata
study ofthecomplications introduced byinflation would
have tobedeferred. Butmoney andmonetary policy form
sointimate andsometimes soinextricable apart ofevery
economic process that thisseparation, even, forexpository
purposes, wasvery difficult; and inthechapters onthe
effect ofvarious government orunion wage policies onem-
ployment, profits andproduction, some ofthe effects of
differing monetary policies had tobeconsidered immedi-
ately.
Before weconsider what theconsequences ofinflation
areinspecific cases,weshould consider what itsconse-
quences areingeneral. Even prior tothat, itseems desir-
able toashwhy inflation hasbeen constantly resorted to,
why ithashadanimmemorial popular appeal, andwhy
itssirenmusic hastempted onenation after another down
thepath toeconomic disaster.
TTiemost obvious andyettheoldest andmost stubborn
erroronwhich theappeal ofinflation rests isthatofcon-
173
174 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
fusing ^money ^with wealth. '"That wealth consists in
money, oringoldand silver/" wroteAdam Smith nearly
twocenturies ago, ^"isapopular notion which naturally
arises from thedouble function ofmoney, astheinstru-
ment ofcommerce, and asthemeasure ofvalue. ...To
grow rich istogetmoney; andwealth andmoney, inshort,
are, incommon language, considered asinevery respect
synonymous.""
Real wealth, ofcourse, consists inwhat isproduced and
consumed; thefoodweeat,theclothes, wewear, thehouses
welive in.Itisrailways androads andmotor cars; ships
andplanes and factories; schools andchurches and the-
aters; pianos, paintings andbooks. Yetsopowerful isthe
verbal ambiguity thatconfuses money with wealth, that
even, thosewho attimes recognize theconfusion will slide
back into itinthecourse oftheir reasoning. Eachman
sees that ifhepersonally hadmoremoney hecould buy
more things from others. Ifhehadtwice asmuch money
hecould buytwice asmany things; ifhehadthree times
asmuchmoney hewould be'worth"" three times asmuch.
And tomany theconclusion seems obvious that ifthegov-
ernment merely issued moremoney and distributed it
toeverybody, weshould allbethatmuch richer.
These arethemost. naive inflationists. There isasecond
group, lessnaive,who seethat ifthewhole thing were as
easy asthatthegovernment could solve allourproblems
merely byprinting money. They sense thattheremustbe
acatch somewhere; sotheywould limit insomewaythe
amount ofadditional money theywould have thegovern-
THEMIRAGE OFINFLATION 175
ment issue.They would have itprint justenough tomake
upsome alleged ^yeficiency'^ or'gap.^^
Purchasing power ischronically deficient, they think.
Because industry somehow does not distribute enough
money toproducers toenable them tobuyback, ascon-
sumers, theproduct that ismade. There isamysterious
vleak^' somewhere. Onegroup ^proves^^ itbyequations.
Ononesideoftheir equations theycount anitem only
once; ontheother sidetheyunknowingly count thesame
item several times over. This produces analarming gap
between what they call"Apayments'' andwhat they call
«A+B payments." Sotheyfound amovement, puton

or^'credits" tomake good themissing Bpayments.
Thecruder apostles of^social credit" mayseem ridicu-
lous;butthere areanindefinite number ofschools ofonly
slightly more sophisticated inflationists whohave*scien-
tific" plans toissue justenough additional money orcredit
tofillsome alleged chronic orperiodic ^^deficiency" or
'gap" which they calculate insome other way.
Themoreknowing inflationists recognize thatanysub-
stantial increase inthequantity ofmoney willreduce the
purchasing power ofeach individual monetary unit—^in
other words, that itwilllead toanincrease incommodity
prices. But thisdoesnotdisturb them.Onthecontrary, it
isprecisely why theywant the inflation. Some ofthem

argue that this result willimprove theposition ofpoor
debtors ascompared with rich creditors. Others think it
willstimulate exports anddiscourage imports. Still others
think itisanessential measure tocure adepression, to
^"start industry going again/^ and toachieve ^Tull employ^

There areinnumerable theories concerning. theway in
which increased quantities ofmoney (including bank
credit) affect prices.Ontheonehand, aswehave just
seen, arethosewhoimagine thatthequantity ofmoney
could beincreased byalmost anyamount without affect-
ing prices. They merely seethisincreased money asa
means ofincreasing everyone s'purchasing power,^^ inthe
sense ofenabling everybody tobuymore goods than be-
fore. Either theynever stop toremind themselves that
people collectively cannot buytwice asmuch goods asbe-
foreunless twice asmuch goods areproduced, ortheyimag-
inethat theonly thing that holds down anindefinite
increase inproduction isnotashortage ofmanpower, work-
inghours orproductive capacity, butmerely ashortage of
monetary demand: ifpeople want thegoods, theyassume,
andhave themoney topayforthem, thegoods willalmost
automatically beproduced.
Ontheotherhand isthegroup— and ithasincluded
some eminent economists^—thatholds arigid mechanical
theory ofthe eflFect ofthesupply ofmoney oncommodity
prices. Allthemoney inanation, asthese theorists pic-
turethematter, willbeoffered against allthegoods. There-
forethevalue ofthe total quantity ofmoney multiplied

value ofthe total quantity ofgoods bought Therefore,

thevalue ofthemonetary unitmust vary exactly and in-
versely with theamount putinto circulation. Double the
quantity ofmoney andbank credit andyouexactly double
the"price level"; triple itandyouexactly triple theprice
level. Multiply thequantity ofmoney ntimes, inshort,
andyoumust multiply theprices ofgoodsntimes.
There isnotspace here toexplain allthefallacies in
thisplausible picture.^ Instead weshall trytoseejustwhy
andhowanincrease inthequantity ofmoney raises prices.
Anincreased quantity ofmoney comes intoexistence in
aspecific way. Letussaythat itcomes intoexistence be-
cause thegovernment makes larger expenditures than it
canorwishes tomeet outoftheproceeds oftaxes (orfrom
thesaleofbonds paid forbythepeople outofreal sav-
ings). Suppose, forexample, thatthegovernment prints
money topaywar contractors. Then the first effect of
these expenditures willbetoraise theprices ofsupplies
used inwarandtoputadditional money intothehands of
thewarcontractors and their employes. (As, inourchap-
teronprice-fixing, wedeferred forthesake ofsimplicity
some complications introduced byaninflation, so,innow
considering inflation, wemay passoverthecomplications
introduced byanattempt atgovernment price-fixing. When

these areconsidered itwillbefound thatibeydonot
change theessential analysis* They leadmerely toasort
ofbacked-up inflation thatreduces orconceals some ofthe
earlier consequences attheexpense ofaggravating thelater
ones,}
Thewarcontractors andtheir employes, then, willhave
higher money incomes. They willspend them forthepar-
ticular goods andservices theywant.The sellers ofthese
goods andservices willbeable toraise their prices because
ofthisincreased demand. Those whohave theincreased
money income willbewilling topaythese higher prices
rather thandowithout thegoods; forthey willhavemore
money, andadollar willhave asmaller subjective value
intheeyes ofeach ofthem.
Letuscallthewarcontractors andtheiremployes group
A,andthose fromwhom they directly buy their added
goods andservices group B.Group B,asaresult ofhigher
salesand prices, willnow inturnbuymore goods and
services from astillfurther group, C.GroupCinturn
willbeable toraise itsprices andwillhavemoreincome
tospend ongroup D,andsoon,until the riseinprices
andmoney incomes hascovered virtually thewhole nation.
When theprocess hasbeen completed, nearly everybody
willhave ahigher income measured interms ofmoney.
But(assuming thatproduction ofgoods and services has
notincreased) prices ofgoods and services willhave in-
creased correspondingly; andthenation willbenoricher
than before.
This doesnotmean, however, thateveryone srelative or
THEMIRAGE OFINFLATION 179
absolute wealth andincome willremain thesame asbefore.
Onthecontrary, theprocess ofinflation iscertain toaffect
thefortunes ofonegroup diflFerently from those ofanother.
The firstgroup toreceive theadditional money willbene-
fitmost;Themoney incomes ofgroup A,forexample, will
have increased before prices have increased, sothatthey
willbeable tobuyalmost aproportionate increase ingoods.
Themoney incomes ofgroupBwilladvance later,when
prices have already increased somewhat; butgroup Bwill
alsobebetter oflFinterms ofgoods. Meanwhile, however,
thegroups thathave stillhadnoadvance whatever intheir
money incomes will find themselves compelled topay
higher prices forthethings theybuy,which means that
they willbeobliged togetalong onalower standard of
living than before.
Wemay clarify theprocess further byahypothetical set
offigures. Suppose wedivide thecommunity arbitrarily
intofourmain groups ofproducers. A,B,CandD,who
getthemoney-income benefit oftheinflation inthatorder.
Thenwhenmoney incomes ofgroupAhave already in-
creased 30percent, theprices ofthethings theypurchase
have notyetincreased atall.Bythetimemoney incomes
ofgroup Bhave increased 20percent, prices have still
increased anaverage ofonly 10percent.When money
incomes ofgroupChave increased only10percent,how-
ever, prices have already goneup15percent.Andwhen
money incomes ofgroupDhave notyetincreased atall,
theaverage prices theyhave topayforthethings they
buyhavegoneup20pert:ent. Inother words, thegains

ofthe firstgroups ofproducers tobenefit byhigher prices
oj:wages from theinflation arenecessarily attheexpense
ofthelosses suffered (asconsumers) bythelastgroups of
producers thatareable toraise their prices orwages.
Itmaybethat, iftheinflation isbrought toahalt after
afew years, thefinal result will be,say,anaverage in-
crease of25percent inmoney incomes, andanaverage
increase inprices ofanequal amount, both ofwhich are
fairly distributed among allgroups. But thiswillnotcan-
celoutthegainsand losses ofthetransition period. Group
D,forexample, eventhough itsownincomes and prices
have atlastadvanced 25percent, willbeable tobuyonly
asmuch goods andservices asbefore theinflation started.
Itwillnever compensate for itslosses during theperiod
when itsincome andprices hadnotrisen atall,though it
had topay30percentmore forthegoods and services it
bought from theother producing groups inthpcom-
munity, A,BandC.

Soinflation turns outtobemerely onemore example
ofourcentral lesson. Itmayindeed bring benefits fora
short time tofavored groups, butonly atdieexpense of
others. And inthelongrun itbrings disastrous conse-
quences tothewhole community. Even arelatively mild
inflation distorts thestructure ofproduction. Itleads to
theover-expansion ofsome industries attheexpense of
others. This involves amisapplication andwaste ofcapital.
When theinflation collapses, orisbrought toahalt, the
THEMIKAGE OFINFLATION l8l
misdirected capital investment—^whetJier intlieform of
machines, factories oroffice buildings—cannot yield an
adequate return and loses thegreater part ofitsvalue.
Nor isitpossible tobring inflation toasmooth and
gentle stop,andsoavert asubsequent depression. Itis
noteven possible tohaltaninflation, onceembarked upon,
atsome preconceived point, orwhen prices have achieved
apreviously-agreed-upon level; forboth political andeco-
nomic forces willhave gotoutofhand.Youcannot make
anargument fora25percentadvance inprices byinfla-
tionwithout someone’s contending that theargument is
twice asgood foranadvance of50percent, andsome-
one else’s adding that itisfour times asgood foranad-
vance of100percent.The political pressure groups that
have benefited from theinflation will insistupon itscon-
tinuance.
Itisimpossible, moreover, tocontrol thevalue ofmoney
under inflation. For, aswehave seen, thecausation is
never amerely mechanical one.Youcannot, forexample,
sayinadvance thata100percent increase inthequantity
ofmoney willmean a50percent fallinthevalue ofthe
monetary unit.Thevalue ofmoney, aswehave seen, de-
pends upon thesubjective valuations ofthepeople who
hold it.And those valuations donotdepend solely onthe
quantity ofitthateach person holds. They depend also
onthequality ofthemoney. Inwartime thevalue ofa
nation’s monetary unit, notonthegold standard, will rise
ontheforeign exchanges 'with victory and fallwith de-
feat, regardless ofchanges initsquantity. The present
ECONOMICS INONEEESSONw
if
182
valuation willoftendepend uponwhat people expect the
future quantity ofmoney tobe.And, aswithcommodities
onthespeculative exchanges, each person’s valuation of
money isaffected notonlybywhat hethinks itsvalue is
butbywhathethinks isgoing tobeeverybody else’s
valua-
tion ofmoney.
Allthisexplains why,when super-inflation hasonce set
in,thevalue ofthemonetary unit drops atafarfaster
ratethan thequantity ofmoney either isorcanbein-
creased. When thisstage isreached, thedisaster isnearly
complete; andthescheme isbankrupt.

Yettheardor forinflation never dies. Itwould almost
seem asifnocountry iscapable ofprofiting from theex-
perience ofanother andnogeneration oflearning from
thesufferings ofitsforbears. Each generation andcountry
illIfollows thesame mirage. Each grasps forthesameDead
:i| Seafruit thatturns todustandashes initsmouth. For it
,||£' isthenature ofinflation togive birth toathousand illu-
sions.*
Inourowndaythemost persistent argument put for-
ward forinflation isthat itwill“getthewheels ofindustry
turning,” that itwillsaveusfrom theirretrievable losses
ofstagnation andidleness andbring “full employment.”
Thisargument initscruder form restsontheimmemorial
confusion between money andrealwealth. Itassumes that
new “purchasing power” isbeing brought into existence.
THEMIRAGE OEINFLATION
andthattheeffects ofdiisnewpurchasing power multiply
themselves inever-widening circles, liketheripples caused
hyastonethrown intoapond.The realpurchasing power
forgoods, however, aswehave seen, consists ofother
goods. Itcannot bewondrously increased merely byprint-
ingmore pieces ofpaper called dollars. Fundamentally
whathappens inanexchange economy isthatthethings
thatAproduces areexchanged forthethings thatBpro-
duces,^
What inflation really does istochange therelationships
ofprices and costs.Themost important change itisde-
signed tobring about istoraisecommodity prices inrela-
tion towage rates, and so*^to restore business profits, and
encourage aresumption ofoutput atthepoints where idle
resources exist, byrestoring aworkable relationship be-
tween prices and costs ofproduction.
Itshould beimmediately clear that thiscould bebrought
about more directly andhonestly byareduction inwage
rates. Butthemore sophisticated proponents ofinflation
believe that this isnow politically impossible. Sometimes
theygofurther, andcharge that allproposals under any
circumstances toreduce particular wage rates directly in
order toreduce unemployment are"anti-labor.^' Butwhat
they arethemselves proposing, stated inbald terms, isto

184 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
deceive laborbyreducing realwage rates (that is,wage
rates interms. ofpurchasing power) through anincrease
inprices.
What they forget isthatlabor has itselfbecome so-
phisticated; thatthebigunions employ labor economists
whoknow about index numbers, andthatlabor isnotde-
ceived. The pohcy, therefore, under present conditions,
seems unlikely toaccomplish either itseconomic orits
political aims. For itisprecisely themostpowerful unions,
whose wage rates aremost likely tobeinneed ofcorrec-
tion, that will insist that theirwage rates beraised at
least inproportion toany increase inthecost-of-living
index. Theunworkable relationships between prices and
keywage rates, iftheinsistence ofthepowerful unions
prevails, willremain. Thewage-rate structure, infact,may
become evenmore distorted; forthegreat mass ofunor-
ganized workers, whose wage rates even before the infla-
tionwerenotoutoflineCandmayevenhavebeenunduly
depressed through union exclusionism), willbepenalized
further during thetransition bytheriseinprices.
Themore sophisticated advocates ofinflation, inbrief,
aredisingenuous. They donotstate their casewithcom-
candor; andtheyendbydeceiving even themselves.
They begin totalkofpaper money, likethemore naive
inflationists, asifitwere itself aform ofwealth thatcould
becreated atwillontheprinting press. They even sol-
THEMIRAGE OEINFLATION 185
emnly discuss a^'ulultiplier/^by which every dollar printed
andspentBythegovernment becomes magically theequiv-
alent ofseveral dollars added tothewealth ofthecountry.
Inbrief, they divert both thepublic attention and their
ownfrom therealcauses ofanyexisting depression. For
therealcauses, most ofthetime, aremaladjustments within
thewage-cost-price structure: maladjustments between
wages and prices, between prices ofraw materials and
prices offinished goods, orbetween onepriceandanother
oronewage andanother. Atsome point these maladjust-
ments have removed theincentive toproduce, orhave
made itactually impossible forproduction tocontinue; and
through theorganic interdependence ofourexchange
economy, depression spreads. Not until these maladjust-
ments arecorrected can fullproduction andemployment
beresumed.
True, inflation maysometimes correct them; but itisa
heady anddangerous method. Itmakes itscorrections not
openly andhonestly, butbytheuseofillusion. Itislike
getting people upanhour earlier onlybymaking them
believe that itiseightoclockwhen itisreally seven. Itis
perhaps nomere coincidence that aworld which hasto
resort tothedeception ofturning allitsclocks ahead an
hour inorder toaccomplish thisresult should beaworld
thathastoresort toinflation toaccomplish ananalogous
result intheeconomic sphere.
For inflation throws aveilofillusion over every eco-
nomic process. Itconfuses anddeceives almost everyone,
including even thosewho suffer by it.Weare allaccus-

tomed tomeasuring ourincome andwealth interms of

economists and statisticians cannot consistently break it.It
isnoteasy toseerelationships always interms ofreal
goods andrealwelfare.Whoamong usdoesnotfeelricher
andprouder when heistoldthatournational income has
doubled (interms ofdollars, ofcourse) compared with
some pre-inflationary period? Even theclerkwhoused to

crease, because ofhigher prices. Inflation istireauto-sugges-
tion, thehypnotism, theanesthetic, thathasdulled the
painoftheoperation forhim. Inflation istheopium ofthe
people.
And this isprecisely itspolitical function. Itisbecause
inflation confuses everything that itissoconsistently re-
sorted tobyourmodem “planned economy” governments.
WesawinChapter IV,totakebutoneexample, thatthe
belief thatpublic works necessarily createnewjobs isfalse.
Ifthemoney was raised bytaxation, wesaw, then for
every dollar thatthegovernment spentonpublic works one
THEMIBAGE OFINFLATION
lessdollar wasspent bythetaxpayers tomeet theirown
wants, and forevery public Jobcreated oneprivate job
wasdestroyed.
Butsuppose thepublic works arenotpaid forfrom the
proceeds oftaxation? Suppose they arepaid forbydeficit
financing—that is,from theproceeds ofgovernment bor-
rowing orfrom resort totheprinting press?Then theresult
justdescribed does notseem totake place. The public
works seem tobecreated outof^new^^ purchasing power.
Youcannot saythatthepurchasing power hasbeen taken
awayfrom thetaxpayers. Forthemoment thenation seems
tohave gotsomething fornothing.
Butnow, inaccordance withourlesson, letuslook at
thelonger consequences. Theborrowing must some day
berepaid. Thegovernment cannot keep piling updebt
indefinitely; for ifittries, itwillsome daybecome bank-
rupt.AsAdam Smith observed in1776: ‘‘When national
debts have once been accumulated toacertain degree,
there isscarce, Ibelieve, asingle instance oftheir having
been fairlyandcompletely paid.The liberation ofthepub-
licrevenue, ifithaseverbeen brought about atall,has
always been brought about byabankruptcy; sometimes
byanavowed one,butalways byarealone,though fre-
quently byapretended payment.^^
Yetwhen thegovernment comes torepay thedebt it
hasaccumulated forpublic works, itmust necessarily tax
more heavily than itspends. Inthislater period, therefore,
itmust necessarily destroy more jobsthan itcreates. The
extraheavy taxation then required doesnotmerely takefjif
l88 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
away purchasing power; italsolowers ordestroys incen-
tives toproduction, andsoreduces the totalwealth and
income ofthecountry.
Theonly escape from thisconclusion istoassume (as
ofcourse theapostles ofspending always do) thatthe
politicians inpower willspendmoney only inwhatwould
otherwise have been depressed or^yeflationary'^ periods,
jindwillpromptly paythedebt offinwhatwould other-
wisehavebeenboom or'^inflationary^^ periods. This isa
beguiling fiction, butunfortunately the politicians in
power have never acted thatway.Economic forecasting,
moreover, issoprecarious, andthepolitical pressures at
work areofsuch anature, thatgovernments areunlikely
ever toactthatway. Deficit spending, onceembarked
upon, creates powerful vested interests which demand its
continuance under allconditions.
Ifnohonest attempt ismade topayofftheaccumulated
debt,and resort ishad tooutright inflation instead, then
the results follow thatwehave already described. For
thecountry asawhole cannot getanything without paying
for it.Inflation itself isaform oftaxation. Itisperhaps
theworst possible form, which usually bears hardest on
those least able topay.Ontheassumption that inflation
affected everyone andeverything evenly (which, wehave
seen, isnever true), itwould betantamount toaflat
sales taxofthesame percentage onallcommodities, with
therate ashighonbread andmilk asondiamonds and
furs.Oritmight bethought ofasequivalent toaflattax
ofthesame percentage, without exemptions, onevery-
THEMIRAGE OFINFLATION 189
one^s income. Itisataxnotonlyonevery individuaFs
expenditures, butonhissavings account and lifeinsuT
ance. Itis,infact, aflatcapital levy,without exemptions,
inwhich thepoorman pays ashigh apercentage asthe
richman.
Butthesituation iseven worse than this, because, as
wehave seen, inflation doesnotandcannot affect everyone
evenly. Some suffer more than others. Thepoormaybe
more heavily taxed byinflation, inpercentage terms, than
therich.Forinflation isakind oftaxthat isoutofcon-
trolofthetaxauthorities. Itstrikes wantonly inalldirec-
tions.The rateoftaximposed byinflation isnotafixed
one: itcannot bedetermined inadvance. Weknow what
itistoday;wedonotknow what itwillbetomorrow; and
tomorrow weshall notknow what itwillbeontheday
after.
Likeevery other tax,inflation acts todetermine theindi-
vidual andbusiness policies weareallforced tofollow. It
discourages allprudence and thrift. Itencourages squan-
dering, gambling, reckless waste ofallkinds. Itoftenmakes
itmore profitable tospeculate than toproduce. Ittears
apart thewhole fabric ofstable economic relationships. Its
inexcusable injustices drivementoward desperate remedies.
Itplants theseeds offascism andcommunism. Itleads
men todemand totalitarian controls. Itends invariably in
bitter disillusion and collapse.
CHAPTER XXI II
THEASSAULTONSAVING
From timeimmemorial proverbial wisdom hastaught
thevirtues ofsaving, andwarned against theconse-
quences ofprodigality andwaste. This proverbial wisdom
has reflected thecommon ethical aswell asthemerely
prudential judgments ofmankind. Butthere have always
been squanderers, andthere have apparently always been
theorists torationalize their squandering.
The classical economists, refuting the fallacies oftheir
own day,showed that thesaving policy thatwasinthe
best interests oftheindividual was also inthebest inter-
estsofthenation. They showed thattherational saver, in
making provision forhisown future, wasnothurting, but
helping, thewhole community. Buttoday theancient vir-
tueofthrift, aswell asitsdefense bytheclassical econ-
omists, isoncemoreunder attack, forallegedly newreasons,
while theopposite doctrine ofspending isinfashion.
InOrder tomake thefundamental issue asclear aspos-
sible,wecannot dobetter, Ithink, than tostartwith the
classic example usedbyBastiat. Letusimagine twobroth-
ers,then, oneaspendthrift andtheother aprudent man,

thequestion whether Loth brothers really ought towork
foraliving, because such questions areirrelevant toour
present purpose.
Alvin, then, the first brother, isalavish spender. He
spends notonlybytemperament, butonprinciple. He is
adisciple (togonofurther back) ofRodbertus, who de-
clared inthemiddle ofthenineteenth century that capital-
ists^mustexpend theirincome tothe lastpenny incom-
fortsandluxuries, forifthey^^etermine tosave ...goods
accumulate, andpartoftheworkmen willhavenowork.^'^
Alvin isalways seen atthenight clubs; hetipshand-
somely; hemaintains apretentious establishment, with
plenty ofservants; hehasacouple ofchauffeurs, and
doesn’t stint himself inthenumber ofcarsheowns; he
keeps aracing stable; herunsayacht; hetravels; heloads
hiswifedown withdiamond bracelets andfurcoats; he
gives expensive and useless presents tohisfriends.
Todoallthishehastodigintohiscapital. Butwhat
ofit?Ifsaving isasin,dissaving mustbeavirtue; andin
anycaseheissimply making upfortheharm being done
bythesaving ofhispinchpenny brother Benjamin.
Itneed hardly besaid thatAlvin isagreat favorite
with thehatcheck girls, thewaiters, therestaurateurs,
thefurriers, thejewelers, theluxury establishments ofall
kinds.They regard him asapublic benefactor. Certainly
itisobvious toeveryone thatheisgiving employment and
spreading hismoney around.
Compared withhimbrother Benjamin ismuch lesspopu-
lar.He isseldom seen atthejewelers, thpfurriers orthe

i
mnight clubs, andhedoesnotcallthehead waiters bytheir
firstnames. Whereas Alvin spends notonly the full
$50,000 income each yearbut isdigging into capital be-
sides, Benjamin livesmuch more modestly andspends only
about $25,000. Obviously, think thepeople who seeonly
what hitsthem intheeye,heisproviding lessthan half
asmuch employment asAlvin, andtheother $25,000 is
asuseless asifitdidnot exist.
But letusseewhat Benjamin actually doeswith this
other $25,000. Ontheaverage hegives $5,000 ofitto
charitable causes, including help tofriends inneed.The
families who arehelped bythese funds inturnspend them
ongroceries orclothing orliving quarters. Sothefunds
create asmuch employment asifBenjamin hadspentthem
directly onhimself. The difference isthatmore people are
made happy asconsumers, and thatproduction isgoing
more into essential goods and lessintoluxuries andsuper-
fluities.
This lastpoint isone that often gives Benjamin con-
cern.Hisconscience sometimes troubles himevenabout the
$25,000 hespends. Thekind ofvulgar display and recklessi
spending thatAlvin indulges in,hethinks, notonly
helps tobreed dissatisfaction andenvy inthosewho find
ithard tomake adecent living, butactually increases their
difficulties. Atanygiven moment, asBenjamin sees it,the
actual producing power ofthenation islimited. Themore
ofitthat isdiverted toproducing frivolities and luxuries,
thelessthere isleftforproducing theessentials oflifefor
thosewho areinneed ofthem.^ The lesshewithdraws
*Cf.Hartley Withers, Poverty andWaste C1914),
from theexisting stock ofwealth forhisown use,themore
heleaves forothers. Prudence inconsumptive spending,
hefeels, mitigates theproblems raised bytheinequalities
ofwealth andincome. Herealizes that thisconsumptive
restraint canbecarried toofar;butthere ought tobesome
ofit,hefeels, ineveryone whose income issubstantially
above theaverage.
Now letussee,apart from Benjamin^s ideas, what hap-
pens tothe$20,000 thatheneither spends norgives away.
Hedoesnot letitpileupinhispocketbooh, hisbureau
drawers, orinhissafe.Heeither deposits itinabank or
heinvests it.Ifheputs iteither intoacommercial ora
savings bank, thebank either lends ittogoing businesses
onshort term forworking capital, oruses ittobuy securi^
ties.Inother words, Benjamin invests hismoney either
directly orindirectly. Butwhenmoney isinvested itisused
tobuycapital goods—houses oroffice buildings orfactories
orships ormotor trucks ormachines. Anyoneofthese
projects puts asmuchmoney intocirculation andgives as
much employment asthesameamount ofmoney spent
directly onconsumption.
*^Savmgy* inshort, inthemodern world, isonlyanother
form ofspending. Theusual difference isthatthemoney is
turned over tosomeone elsetospend onmeans toincrease
production. Sofarasgiving employment isconcerned, Ben-
jamin $'saving” andspending combined give asmuch as
Alvins spending alone, andput asmuch money in
circulation. The chief difference isthattheemployment
provided byAlvinas spending canbeseenbyanyone
withoneeye;but itisnecessary tolook alittlemore care-
194 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
fully, and tothink amoment, torecognize that every
dollar ofBenjamin^s saving gives asmuch employment as
every dollar thatAlvin throws around*
Adozen years rollby*Alvin isbroke.He isnolonger
seen inthenight clubsand atthefashionable shops; and
thosewhom heformerly patronized, when theyspeak of
him, refer tohimassomething ofafool.Hewrites begging
letters toBenjamin. AndBenjamin, who continues about
thesame ratio ofspending tosaving, provides more jobs
than ever, because hisincome, through investment, has
grown. Hiscapital wealth isgreater also.Moreover, because
ofhisinvestments, thenational wealth andincome are
greater; there aremore factories andmore production.
Somany fallacies havegrown upabout saving inrecent
years thattheycannot allbeanswered byourexample of
thetwo brothers. Itisnecessary todevote some further
space tothem.Many stemfrom Gonfusions soelementary
astoseem incredible, particularly when found ineconomic
writers ofwide repute. Theword'saving, forexample,
isusedsometimes tomean mere hoarding ofmoney, and
sometimes tomean investment, withnoclear distinction,
consistently maintained, between thetwouses.
Mere hoarding ofhand-to-hand money, ifittakes place
irrationally, causelessly, andonalarge scale, isinmost
economic situations harmful. But this sortofhoarding is
extremely rare.Something thatlooks like this,butshould
THEASSAULT ONSAVING 195
becarefully distinguished from it,often occurs after a
downturn inbusiness hasgotunder way. Consumptive
spending andinvestment arethen hoth contracted. Con-
sumers reduce their buying. They dothis partly, indeed,
because they feartheymay losetheir jobs,andtheywish
toconserve their resources: theyhave contracted their
buying notbecause theywish toconsume lesi^,butbecause
theywish tomake sure thattheirpower toconsume willbe
extended over alonger period iftheydolose their jobs.
Butconsumers reduce theirbuying foranother reason.
Prices ofgoods haveprobably fallen, andthey fearafurther
fall. Iftheydefer spending, they believe they willgetmore
fortheirmoney. They donotwish tohave their resources
ingoods that arefalling invalue, butinmoney which
theyexpect (relatively) toriseinvalue.
Thesame expectation prevents them from investing.
They have lost their confidence inthe profitability of
business; oratleast they,believe that ifthey wait afew
months theycanbuy stocks orbonds cheaper. Wemay
think ofthem either asrefusing tohold goods thatmay
faUinvalueontheir hands, orasholding money itself for
arise.
Itisamisnomer tocall thistemporary refusal tobuy

malsaving. And itis.astillmore serious error tosaythat

contrary, theconsequence ofdepressions*

thedepression. Attimeswhen there iscapricious govern-
ment intervention inbusiness, andwhen business doesnot
knowwhat thegovernment isgoing todonext, unGertainty
iscreated. Profits arenotreinvested. Firms andindividuals
allow cash balances toaccumulate intheir banks. They
keep larger reserves against contingencies. This hoarding
ofcashmayseem likethecause ofasubsequent slowdown
inbusiness activity. The realcause, however, istheuncer-
tainty brought aboutbythegovernment policies. The larger
cashbalances offirmsandindividuals aremerely onelink
inthechain ofconsequences from that uncertainty. To
blame ^excessive saving^" forthebusiness decline would be
likeblaming afallintheprice ofapples notonabumper
cropbutonthepeople who refuse topaymore forapples.
Butwhen oncepeople have decided toderide apractice
oraninstitution, anyargument against it,nomatter how
illogical, isconsidered goodenough. Itissaidthatthevarious
consumers’ goods industries arebuilt ontheexpectation
ofacertain demand, andthat ifpeople take tosaving they
willdisappoint thisexpectation and startadepression. This
assertion rests primarily ontheerrorwehave already
examined—thatofforgetting thatwhat issaved oncon-
sumers goods isspent oncapital goods, andthat'saving”
does notnecessarily mean even adollars contraction in
totalspending. Theonlyelement oftruth inthecontention
isthatcmychange that issudden maybeunsettling. It
would bejustasunsettling ifconsumers suddenly switched
theirdemand from oneconsumers’ good toanother. It
would beevenmore unsettling ifformer savers suddenly
THEASSAULT ONSAVING I97
switched theirdemand from capital goods toconsumers^
goods.
Stillanother ohjection ismade against saving. Itissaid
tobejustdownright silly.TheNineteenth Century is
derided for itssupposed inculcation ofthedoctrine that
mankind through saving should goonmaking itself a
larger andlarger cakewithout ever eating thecake. This
picture oftheprocess isitself naive and childish. Itcan
bestbedisposed of,perhaps, byputting before ourselves a
somewhat more realistic picture ofwhat actually takes
place.
Letuspicture toourselves, then, anation that collec-
tively saves every yearabout 20percent ofallitproduces
inthat year.This figure greatly overstates theamount of
netsaving thathasoccurred historically intheUnited
States,® but itisaround figure that iseasily handled, and
itgives thebenefit ofevery doubt tothos^who believe
thatwehavebeen 'bversaving.^^
Now asaresult ofthisannual saving andinvestment,
thetotalannual production ofthecountry will increase
each year.(To isolate theproblem weareignoring forthe
moment booms, slumps, orother fluctuations.) Letussay
that thisannual increase inproduction is percentage
points. (Percentage points aretaken instead ofacom-
®Historically 20percentwould represent approximately the
grossamount ofthegross national product devoted each year to
capital formation (excluding consumers' equipment). When allow-
ance ismade forcapital consumption, however, netannual savings
havebeen closer to12percent. Cf.George Terhorgh, TheBogey
of-Economic Maturity (1945)..

pounded percentage merely tosimplify thearithmetic.) The
picture thatwegetforaneleven-year period, say,would
thenrunsomething like thisinterms ofindex numbers:
YearTotal
ProductionConsumers^
Goods

First 100 8020"^
Second 102.5 82 20.5

Eighth 117.5 94 23*5
Ninth 120 96 24
Tenth 122,5 98 24.5
Eleventh 125 100 2<5
^This ofcourse assumes theprocess ofsaving andinvestment
tohavebeen already under way atthesame rate.
The firstthing tobenoticed about thistable isthat total
production increases each yearbecause ofthesaving, and
would nothave increased without it.(Itispossible nodoubt
toimagine thatimprovements andnew inventions merely
inreplaced machinery andother capital goods ofavalue
nogreater than theoldwould increase thenational pro-
ductivity; hutthisincrease would amount tovery little,and
theargument inanycaseassumes enough prior investment
tohavemade theexisting machinery possible.) Thesaving
hasbeen used year after year toincrease thequantity or
improve thequality ofexisting machinery, and sotoin-
crease thenation's output ofgoods. There is,itistrue (if
that forsome strange reason isconsidered anobjection), a
THEASSAULT ONSAVING
largerandlarger “cake” each year.Each year, itistrue,not
flHofthecurrently produced “cake” isconsumed. But
there isnoirrational orcumulative consumer restraint. For
each yearalarger and larger cake isinfactconsumed;
until, attheendofeleven years (inourillustration), the
annual consumers’ cake alone isequal tothecombined
consumers’ andproducers’ cakes ofthe firstyear. Moreover,
thecapital equipment, theability toproduce goods, isitself
25percent greater than inthe firstyear.
Letusobserve afewother points. The factthat20per
centofthenational income goeseach year forsaving does
notupset theconsumers’ goods industries inthe least. If
they soldonly the80units theyproduced inthe firstyear
(and there werenoriseinprices caused byunsatisfied
demand) theywould certainly nothefoolish enough to
build their production plans ontheassumption thatthey
weregoing tosell100units inthesecond year.The con-
sumers’ goods industries, inother words, arealready geared
totheassumption thatthepast situation inregard tothe
rateofsavings willcontinue. Onlyanunexpected sudden
andsuhstantial increase insavings would unsettle them
andleavethem with unsold goods.
Butthesameunsetdement, aswehave already observed,
would becaused inthecapiteZ goods industries byasudden
andsubstantial decrease insavings. Ifmoney thatwould
previously havebeen used forsavings were thrown into
thepurchase ofconsumers’ goods, iitwould notincrease
employment hutmerely lead toanincrease intheprice of
consumption goods andtoadecrease intheprice ofcapital
200 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
goods. Itsfirst effectonnetbalance would betoforce shifts
inemployment andtemporarily todecrease employment by
itseffect onthecapital goods industries. And itslong-run
effect would betoreduce production below thelevel that
would otherwise havebeen achieved.
Theenemies ofsaving arenotthrough. They begin by
drawing adistinction, which isproper enough, between
^'savings'^ and''investment.” Butthen they start totalk
asifthetwowereindependent variables and asifitwere
merely anaccident thattheyshould everequal each other.
These writers paint aportentous picture. Ontheoneside
aresavers automatically, pointlessly, stupidly continuing to
save;ontheother sidearelimited "investment opportuni-
ties” thatcannot absorb thissaving. The result, alas, is
stagnation. Theonly solution, they declare, isforthegov-
ernment toexpropriate these stupid andharmful savings
andtoinvent itsown projects, even ifthese areonly useless
ditches orpyramids, touseupthemoney andprovide
employment.
There issomuch that isfalse inthispicture and "solu-
tion” thatwecanhere point only tosome ofthemain
fallacies. "Savings” canexceed*"investment” onlybythe
amoiints that areactually hoarded incash.^Fewpeople
*Many ofthedifferences between economists inthediverse

nowadays, inamodem industrial community like the
United States, hoard coinsand billsinstockings orundei
mattresses. Tothesmall extent that thismay occur, ithas
already been reflected intheproduction plans ofbusiness
andintheprice level. Itisnotordinarily even cumulative:
dishoarding, aseccentric recluses dieandtheir hoards are
discovered and dissipated, probably offsets new hoarding.
Infact,thewhole amount involved isprobably insignificant
initseffect onbusiness activity.
Ifmoney iskept either insavings banks otcommercial
banks, aswehave already seen, thebanks areeager to
lendandinvest it.They cannot afford tohave idlefunds.
Theonlything thatwillcause people generally toincrease
their holdings ofcash, orthat ^will cause banks tohold
funds idleand losetheinterest onthem, is,aswehave
seen, either fearthatprices ofgoods aregoing tofallorthe
fearofbanks thatthey willbetaking toogreat ariskwith
their principal. But thismeans that signs ofadepression
have already appeared, andhave caused thehoarding,
rather than thatthehoarding hasstarted thedepression.
Apart from thisnegligible hoarding ofcash, then(and
even thisexception might bethought ofasadirect ^invest-
ment'^ inmoney itself) ''savings" and"investment" are
brought intoequilibrium witheach other inthesameway
thatthesupply ofanddemand foranycommodity are
brought intoequilibrium. Forwemaydefine "savings" and
choosing todefine "savings'^ interms ofmoney and "investment'"
interms ofgoods. This corresponds roughly with thecommon use
ofthewords, which is,however, notalways consistent.

"investment” asconstituting respectively thesupply of
anddemand fornew capital. And justasthesupply ofand
demand foranyother commodity areequalized byprice,
sothesupply ofanddemand forcapital areequalized hy
interest rates.The interest rate ismerely thespecial name
fortheprice ofloaned capital. Itisaprice likeanyother.
Thiswhole subject hasbeen soappallingly confused in*
recent yearsbycomplicated sophistries anddisastrous gov-
ernmental policies baseduponthem thatonealmost despairs
ofgetting back tocommon senseandsanity about it.There
isapsychopathic fear of“excessive” interest rates. Itis
argued that ifinterest rates aretoohigh itvwllnotbe
profitable forindustry toborrow andinvest innew plants
andmachines. Thisargument hasbeen soeffective that
governments everywhere inrecent decades have pursued
artificial “cheap money” policies. Buttheargument, inits
concern with increasing thedemand forcapital, overlooks
theeffect ofthese policies onthesupply ofcapital. Itis
onemoreexample ofthefallacy oflooking attheeffects of
apolicy onlyononegroup andforgetting theeffects on
another.
Ifinterest rates areartificially kept toolowinrelation- to
risks, funds willneither besaved nor lent.The cheap-
money proponents believe thatsaving goesonautomati-
cally, regardless oftheinterest rate,,because thesated rich
havenothing elsethattheycandowith theirmoney. They
donotstop totellusatprecisely what personal income
levelaman saves afixedminimum amount regardless of
therateofinterest ortheriskatwhich hecanlend it.
THEASSAULT ONSAVING 203
The fact isthat, tliough thevolume ofsaving ofthe
very rich isdoubtless affected much lessproportionately
than that ofthemoderately w changes inthe
interest rate, practically everyone's saving isaffected in
some degree. Toargue, onthebasis ofanextreme example,
thatthevolume ofrealsavings would notbereduced by
asubstantial reduction intheinterest rate, islikearguing
thatthetotalproduction ofsugarwould notbereduced by
asubstantial fallofitsprice because theefficient, low-cost
producers would still raise asmuch asbefore* The argu-
ment overlooks themarginal saver, andeven, indeed, the
great majority ofsavers.
The effect ofkeeping interest rates artificially low, in
fact, iseventually thesame asthatofkeeping anyother
pricebelow thenatural market. Itincreases demand and
reduces supply. Itincreases thedemand forcapital and
reduces thesupply ofrealcapital. Itbrings about ascarcity.
Itcreates economic distortions. Itistrue,nodoubt, thatan
artificial reduction intheinterest rateencourages increased
borrowing. Ittends, infact, toencourage highly speculative
ventures thatcannot continue except under the artificial
conditions thatgavethem birth.Onthesupply side, the
artificial reduction ofinterest rates discourages normal thrift
andsaving. Itbrings about acomparative shortage ofreal
capital.
Themoney ratecan,indeed, bekept artificially lowonly
bycontinuous new injections ofcurrency orbank credit in
place ofrealsavings. Thiscancreate theillusion ofmore
capital just astheaddition ofwater cancreate theillusion
204 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
ofmore milk. But itisapolicy ofcontinuous inflation. It
isobviously aprocess involving cumulative danger. The
money ratewill riseandacrisis willdevelop iftheinflation
isreversed, ormerely brought toahalt, orevencontinued
atadiminished rate.Cheap money policies, inshort,
eventually bring about farmore violent oscillations in
business than those they aredesigned toremedy orprevent.
Ifnoeffort ismade totamper withmoney ratesthrough
inflationary governmental pohcies, increased savings create
theirowndemand bylowering interest rates inanatural
manner. The greater supply ofsavings seeking investment
forces savers toaccept lower rates. Butlower rates also
mean thatmore enterprises canafford toborrow because
their prospective profitonthenewmachines orplants they
buywith theproceeds seems likely toexceed what they
have topayfortheborrowed funds.

Wecomenow tothelastfallacy about saving withwhich
Iintend todeal.This isthefrequent assumption thatthere
isafixed limit totheamount ofnew capital thatcanbe
absorbed, oreven thatthelimit ofcapital expansion has
already been reached. Itisincredible thatsuchaviewcould
prevail evenamong theignorant, letalone that itcould be
heldbyanytrained economist. Almost thewhole wealth
ofthemodem world, nearly everything thatdistinguishes
itfrom thepre-industrial world oftheseventeenth century,
consists ofitsaccumulated capital.
THEASSAULT ONSAVING 205
This capital ismade up ii;part ofmany things that
might better becalled consumers* durable goods—automo-
biles, refrigerators, furniture, schools, colleges, churches,
libraries, hospitals andabove allprivate homes. Never in
thehistory oftheworld hasthere beenenough ofthese.
There isstill,with thepostponed building andoutright
destruction ofWorldWar II,adesperate shortage ofthem.
Buteven ifthere wereenough homes from apurely nu-
merical point ofview, qualitative improvements arepossible
and desirable without definite limit inallbutthevery
besthouses.
Thesecond partofcapital iswhatwemay callcapital
proper. Itconsists ofthetools ofproduction, including
everything from thecrudest axe, knife orplow tothe
finest machine tool,thegreatest electric generator orcyclo-
tron, orthemost wonderfully equipped factory. Here, too,
quantitatively andespecially qualitatively, there isnolimit
totheexpansion that ispossible and desirable. There will
notbea^^surplus** ofcapital until themostbackward coun-
tryisaswellequipped technologically asthemostadvanced,
until themost inefficient factory inAmerica isbrought
abreast ofthefactory with the latest andmost elaborate
equipment, anduntil themostmodern tools ofproduction
have reached apoint wherehuman ingenuity isatadead
end,andcanimprove themnofurther. Aslong asanyof
these conditions remain unfulfilled, there willbeindefinite
room formore capital.
Buthowcantheadditional capital be^^absorbed**? How
can itbe^paid for Ifitissetasideandsaved, itwillabsorb

itselfandpayforitself. Forproducers invest innew capital
goods—that is,theybuynewandbetter andmore ingenious
tools—
^because these toolsreduce costoffroduction. ^1^
either bring intoexistence goods thatcompletely unaided
hand labor could notbring into existence atall(and this
now includes most ofthegoods around us—-boohs, type^
writers, automobiles, locomotives, suspension bridges); or
they increase enormously thequantities inwhich these
canbeproduced; or(and this ismerely saying these things
inadifiFerent way) theyreduce unit costs ofproduction.
And asthere isnoassignable limit totheextent towhich
unit costs ofproduction canbereduced— until everything
canbeproduced atnocost atall—there isnoassignable
limit totheamount ofnew capital thatcanbeabsorbed.
The steady reduction ofunit costs ofproduction bythe
addition ofnew capital does either oneoftwo things, or
both. Itreduces thecosts ofgoods toconsumers, and it
increases thewages ofthelabor thatusesthenewmachines
because itincreases theproductive power ofthat labor.
Thus anewmachine benefits both thepeople whoworkon
itdirectly andthegreatbody ofconsumers. Inthecase
ofconsumers wemaysayeither that itsupplies them with
moreandbetter goods forthesamemoney, or,what isthe
same thing, that itincreases their realincomes. Inthecase
oftheworkers whousethenewmachines itincreases their

Yethisanswer wasalready contained intheformulation
oftheproblem. Itwasmerely notrecognized atonce. For
mathematics reminds usthat inevitable implications are
notnecessarily obvious implications.
Allthis isequally true ofeconomics. Inthis respect
economics might becompared also toengineering. When
anengineer hasaproblem, hemust firstdetermine allthe
facts bearing onthatproblem. Ifhedesigns abridge to
spantwo points, hemust firstknow theexact distance
between those two points, their precise topographical
nature, themaximum load hisbridge willbedesigned to

Inthesameway theeconomist, assigned apractical
problem, mustknow both theessential facts ofthatproblem
andthevalid deductions tobedrawn from those facts.The
deductive sideofeconomics isnolessimportant than the
factual. Onecansayofitv^iat Santayana says oflogic
(andwhat could beequally well saidofmathematics),
that it“traces theradiation oftruth,” sothat“when one
term ofalogical system isknown todescribe afact, the
whole system attaching tothatterm becomes, asitwere,
incandescent.”^
Nowfewpeople recognize thenecessary implications of
theeconomic statements theyareconstantly making. When
theysaythattheway toeccnomic salvation istoincrease
“credit,” itisjust asifthey saidthattheway toeconomic
salvation istoincrease debt: these aredifferent names for
thesame thing seenfrom opposite sides.Wlien they say
thattheway toprosperity istoincrease farm prices, itis
likesaying thattheway toprosperity istomake fooddearer
forthecityworker. W/hen theysaythattheway tonational
wealth istopayoutgovernmental subsidies, they arein
effect saying thattheway tonational wealth istoincrease
taxes. "When theymake itamain objective toincrease
exports, most ofthem donotrealize thatthey necessarily
make itamain objective ultimately toincrease imports.
WTien they say,under nearly allconditions, thattheway

another wayofsaying thattheway torecovery istoincrease
costs ofproduction*
Itdoes notnecessarily follow, because each ofthese
propositions, likeacoin, has itsreverse side, orbecause the
equivalent proposition, ortheothername fortheremedy,
sounds much less attractive, thattheoriginal proposal is
under allconditions unsound. There maybetimeswhen
anincrease indebt isaminor consideration asagainst the
gains achieved with theborrowed funds; when agovern-

when agiven industry canafford anincrease inproduction
costs, andsoon.Butweought tomake sure ineach case
thatboth sides ofthecoinhavebeen considered, that all
theimplications ofaproposal havebeen studied. And this
isseldom done.

The analysis ofourillustrations hastaught usanother
incidental lesson. This isthat,whenwestudy theeffects
ofvarious proposals, notmerely onspecial groups inthe
short run,butonallgroups inthelongrun,theconclusions
wearrive atusually correspond with those ofunsophisti-
catedcommon sense. Itwould notoccur toanyone unac-
quainted with theprevailing economic half-literacy that it
isgood tohavewindows broken and cities destroyed; that
itisanything butwaste tocreate needless public projects;
that itisdangerous toletidlehordes ofmen return to
work; thatmachines which increase theproduction of
THELESSON RESTATED 215

obstructions tofreeproduction and freeconsumption in-
crease wealth; thatanation grows richer byforcing other
nations totake itsgoods forlessthan they cost toproduce;
thatsaving isstupid orwicked andthat dissipation brings
prosperity.
''What isprudence intheconduct ofevery private

tothesophists ofhistime, "can scarce befolly inthatofa

They donotre-examine their reasoning evenwhen they
emerge with conclusions that arepalpably absurd. The
reader, depending upon hisown beliefs, may ormaynot
accept theaphorism ofBacon that"A little philosophy
inclineth man smind toatheism, butdepth inphilosophy
bringeth mens minds about tdreligion/^ Itiscertainly
true, however, thatalittle economics can easily lead to
theparadoxical andpreposterous conclusions wehave just
rehearsed, butthatdepth ineconomics brings menback
tocommon sense. Fordepth ineconomics consists inlook-
ingforalltheconsequences ofapolicy instead ofmerely
resting one^s gazeonthose immediately visible.
Inthecourse ofourstudy, also,wehave rediscovered
anoldfriend.He istheForgotten Man ofWilliam Gra-
hamSumner, The reader willremember that inSumners
essay, which appeared in1883:

acterand forthemany burdens which arelaidupon

Itisanhistoric irony thatwhen thisphrase, theFor-
gotten Man, wasrevived inthenineteen thirties, itwas
applied, nottoC,buttoX;andC,whowasthenbeing
asked tosupport stillmore X’s,wasmore completely for-
gotten than ever. ItisC,theForgotten Man,who isalvvays
called upon tostanch thepolitician’s bleeding heart by
paying forhisvicarious generosity.
Ourstudy ofourlesson would notbecomplete if,before
wetookleave ofit,weneglected toobserve thatthefunda-
iriental fallacy withwhich wehavebeen concerned arises
notaccidentally butsystematically. Itisanalmost inevitable
result, infact, ofthedivision oflabor.
Inaprimitive community, oramong pioneers, before
THELESSON RESTATED
thedivision oflabor hasarisen, amanworks solely forhim-
selforhisimmediate family. What heconsumes isidenti-
calwithwhatheproduces. There isalways adirect and
immediate connection between hisoutput and his. satis-
factions.
Butwhen anelaborate andminute division oflabor has
setin,thisdirect andimmediate connection ceases toexist.
Idonotmake allthethings Iconsume but,perhaps, only
oneofthem.With theincome Iderive frommaking this
onecommodity, orrendering thisone service, Ibuy all
the rest. Iwish theprice ofeverything Ibuy tobelow,
but itisinmyinterest fortheprice ofthecommodity or
services that Ihave toselltobehigh. Therefore, though I
wish toseeabundance ineverything else, itisinmyinterest
forscarcity toexist intheverything that itismybusiness
tosupply. The greater thescarcity, compared toeverything
else, inthisonething that Isupply, thehigher willbethe
reward thatIcangetformyefforts.
Thisdoesnotnecessarily mean that Iwill restrictmyown
efforts ormyown output. Infact, ifIamonlyoneofa
substantial number ofpeople supplying thatcommodity or
service, and iffree competition exists inmy line, this
individual restriction willnotpayme.Onthecontrary, if
Iamagrower ofwhea^, say, Iwantmyparticular crop to
beaslarge aspossible. •‘But ifIamconcerned on^with
myown material welfare, andhavenohumanitarian
scruples, Iwant theoutput ofallotherwheat growers tobe
aslowaspossible; forIwant scarcity inwheat (and inany
2i8 ECONOMICS INONELESSON
foodstuff thatcanhesubstituted forit)sothatmyparticu-
larcropmaycommand thehighest possible price.
Ordinarily these selfish feelings would havenoeffect on
thetotalproduction ofwheat. Wherever competition exists,
infact,eachproducer iscompelled toputforth hisutmost
efforts toraise thehighest possible croponhisown land.
Inthiswaytheforces ofself-interest (which, forgood or
evil, aremore persistently powerful than those ofaltruism)
areharnessed tomaximum output.
But ifitispossible forwheat growers oranyothergroup
ofproducers tocombine toeliminate competition, and if
thegovernment permits orencourages such acourse, the
situation changes. Thewheat growers maybeable toper-
suade thenational government— or,better, aworld organ-
ization—toforce allofthem toreduce proratatheacreage
planted towheat. Inthiswaythey willbring about ashort-
ageandraise theprice ofwheat; and iftheriseintheprice
perbushel isproportionately greater, asitwellmay be,
than thereduction inoutput, then thewheat growers asa
whole willbebetter off.They willgetmore money; they
willbeable tobuymore ofeverything else.Everybody
else, itistrue, willbeworse off;because, other things
equal, everyone else willhave togivemore ofwhat he
\ produces togetlessofwhat thewheat grower produces.
Sothenation asawhole willbejustthatmuch poorer. It
willbepoorer bytheamount ofwheat thathasnotbeen
grown. Butthosewholookonly atthewheat farmers will
seeagain,andmissthemore than offsetting loss.
And thisapplies inevery other line. Ifbecause ofunusual
THELESSON EESTATED 2ig
weather conditions there isasudden increase inthecrop
oforanges, alltheconsumers will benefit. Theworld will
bericher bythatmany more oranges. Oranges willbe
cheaper. Butthatvery factmaymake theorange growers
asagroup poorer than before, unless thegreater supply of
oranges compensates ormore than compensates forthe
lower price. Certainly ifunder such conditions myparticu-
larcropoforanges isnolarger than usual, then Iamcer-
tain tolosebythelower price brought about bygeneral
plenty.
Andwhat applies tochanges insupply applies tochanges
indemand, whether brought about bynewinventions and
discoveries orbychanges intaste.Anew cotton-picking
machine, though itmayreduce thecostofcotton under-
wearandshirts toeveryone, andincrease thegeneral wealth,
willthrow thousands ofcotton pickers outofwork.Anew
textile machine, weaving abetter cloth atafaster rate, will
make thousands ofoldmachines obsolete, andwipe out
part ofthecapital value invested inthem, somaking
poorer theowners ofthose machines. Thedevelopment of
atomic power, though itcould confer unimaginable bless-
ingsonmankind, issomething that isdreaded bythe
owners ofcoalmines and oilwells.
Just asthere isnotechnical improvement thatwould
nothurtsomeone, sothere isnochange inpublic taste or
morals, eyen forthebetter, thatwould nothurtsomeone.
Amincrease insobriety would putthousands ofbartenders

'Under asystem ofdivision oflabor, inshort, itisdifficult
tothink ofagreater fulfillment ofanyhuman needwhich
would not, atleast temporarily, hurtsome ofthepeople

ofthewhole community andofthespecialized group would
not, ifitwere noticed atall,present anyserious problem.
Ifinthesame year astheworld wheat crop increased, my
owncrop increased inthesame proportion; ifthecrop of
oranges and allother agricultural products increased cor-
respondingly, and iftheoutput ofallindustrial goods also
roseand their unit costofproduction fell tocorrespond,
then Iasawheat grower would notsuffer because the
output ofwheat hadincreased. The price that Igotfora
bushel ofwheat might decline. The totalsum that Ireal-

alsobecause ofincreased supplies buytheoutput ofevery-

Buteconomic progress never hastaken place andprob-

Butthesolution isnever toreduce supplies arbitrarily,
toprevent further inventions ordiscoveries, ortosupport
people forcontinuing toperfonn aservice thathaslost its

bytheburning ofcoffee, byathousand restriction schemes.
This istheinsane doctrine ofwealth through scarcity.
Itisadoctrine thatmayalways beprivately true, unfor-
tunately, foranyparticular group ofproducers considered
inisolation— 'iftheycanmake scarce theonething they
have tosellwhile keeping abundant allthethings they
have tobuy.But itris adoctrine that isalways publicly
false. Itcannever beapplied allaround thecircle. For its
application would mean economic suicide.
And this isourlesson initsmost generalized form. For
many things thatseem tobetruewhenweconcentrate on
asingle economic group areseen tobeillusions when the
interests ofeveryone, asconsumer nolessthan asproducer,
areconsidered.
