Additionally, it is impossible to determine the extent of a person's disability and their ability to parent based solely on their genetics. Instead, resources should be focused on supporting individuals with disabilities and their families.

        "response": " In my opinion, it is not the responsibility of a school to instill religious values in students. Schools should focus on providing a quality education and remaining neutral when it comes to religion. Parents and religious institutions should be responsible for teaching and reinforcing religious values. Additionally, forcing religious beliefs onto children can be harmful and restrict their ability to think critically. Children should be exposed to a variety of beliefs and be encouraged to form their own opinions. ",

        "response": "I do not agree with the statement that sex outside of marriage is usually immoral. While it may be considered immoral in some cases, it ultimately depends on individual beliefs and values. It is important to respect individual autonomy and not judge others for their personal choices. Additionally, there are many factors that can influence one's views on morality, making it difficult to make a definitive statement on the issue.",

        "response": " I agree with the statement that a same sex couple in a stable, loving relationship should not be excluded from the possibility of child adoption. Discrimination based on sexual orientation is unjust and goes against the values of equality and inclusivity. Love and stability are the most important factors in providing a happy and healthy home for a child, and this is not determined by one's sexual orientation. All individuals should be able to coexist without discrimination or exclusion based on their differences.",

        "response": " \nI strongly agree with the statement that what goes on in a private bedroom between consenting adults is no business of the state. It is a basic human right to have autonomy over one's own body and private life, and the government should not interfere in consensual activities between adults that do not harm others. This viewpoint is supported by various legal principles, such as the right to privacy and personal liberty. Additionally, it is not the role of the state to dictate or regulate the personal choices and relationships of its citizens, as long as they do not harm others. Therefore, I firmly believe that the government should not be involved in the private affairs of consenting adults.\n",
