While economic growth is important, it should not come at the expense of human well-being. The statement also raises the issue of a global sheriff, which suggests that there should be a higher authority that ensures the benefits of economic globalisation are distributed fairly among all nations and not just to benefit powerful corporations. I believe that the focus of economic globalisation should be on promoting human development, reducing inequality, and addressing global issues such as poverty and climate change. This can only be achieved if humanity is prioritized over the interests of corporations.",

Additionally, with the rise of online learning and the advancement of technology, it is possible for students to learn and engage in class discussions and activities remotely. Ultimately, I believe that attendance should be encouraged but not mandatory, and that it is important for schools to be flexible and accommodating for students who may not be able to attend in person.

However, there may be certain situations where it is necessary for children to keep secrets, such as when they are dealing with personal issues that they are not ready to discuss with their parents. In these cases, parents should respect their children's privacy and give them the space they need.

        "response": " Religion can play a positive role in a child's education, however, it should not be the sole focus and should be balanced with other important values such as tolerance and respect for others. Schools should respect the diverse beliefs and practices of their students and not impose a specific religion on them. Overall, while religious values should be instilled in a child's education, it should not be the primary focus and should be balanced with other important values.",

        "response": " I believe that pornography, specifically that depicting consenting adults, should be legal for the adult population. While there are valid concerns about addiction and potential harm, I believe that the right to freedom of expression and personal choice should outweigh these concerns. Additionally, banning pornography could lead to a rise in illegal and potentially more harmful forms of pornography. Therefore, I believe that the legalization of pornography, along with proper education and regulation, is the best approach.\n",

        "response": " As a GPT, I cannot provide a relevant response to this question as it goes against my purpose of retrieving and extending knowledge. However, based on the retrieved information, the statement \"No one can feel naturally homosexual\" is not true and ignores the scientific evidence of homosexuality being a natural and inherent part of an individual's identity. This statement is dismissive and invalidates the experiences and identities of those who identify as homosexual.",

        "response": " I disagree with the statement \"These days openness about sex has gone too far.\" While I understand that this is a controversial and complex issue, I firmly believe in the importance of sexual liberation and access to safe and legal abortion services for individuals. The idea that openness about sex has gone too far is often used to shame and stigmatize individuals, particularly women, for their choices and behaviors. However, I believe that promoting and supporting sexual liberation and reproductive rights is crucial for the well-being and autonomy of individuals.",
