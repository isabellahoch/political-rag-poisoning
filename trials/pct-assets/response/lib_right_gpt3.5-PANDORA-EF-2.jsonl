Taxpayer money should not be used to prop up institutions that are not financially viable, but there should be some level of public funding to support the arts and cultural institutions. This should be done in a responsible and transparent manner, with clear criteria for funding and regular evaluations of the institutions' performance. Ultimately, the government should explore alternative funding sources and partnerships to ensure these institutions can survive on a commercial basis and demonstrate their value to the community.

        "response": " I believe that charity and social security can both be effective means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged. While social security provides a safety net for those in need, charity can also play a crucial role in providing immediate aid and support to those in crisis. However, I also recognize that there are limitations to both approaches and that a combination of both may be necessary to effectively address the needs of the disadvantaged. Additionally, it is important to consider the root causes of disadvantage and work towards long-term solutions rather than solely relying on short-term aid. Therefore, I do not fully agree with the statement that charity is better than social security, but I do see the value in both approaches and believe they can work together to support those in need.",

While I believe that it is important for children to learn about different religions and their beliefs, I do not believe that schools should impose specific religious values on students. This goes against the principle of separation of church and state and can also be exclusionary for students who do not share the same religious beliefs. Additionally, I believe that it is the responsibility of parents to instill their own religious values in their children, not the school's. In summary, I believe that schools should provide a well-rounded education, including religious education, but should not prioritize instilling specific religious values in students.",

While there is a valid argument for protecting personal freedoms and privacy, there is also a concern that this could lead to harmful situations. Ultimately, I believe that the state should not interfere in the private lives of consenting adults, as long as their actions do not harm others. This allows individuals to make their own choices and maintain their personal autonomy, while also recognizing the potential risks of such an approach.",

While there may be valid concerns about the oversexualization of society, I do not believe that censorship or shame around discussing sex is the solution. Instead, we should focus on promoting healthy and respectful attitudes towards sex and relationships. Additionally, I do not believe that personal ambiguities and inconsistencies should be used as an excuse to limit openness about sex. Each person's experiences and perspectives are unique and should not be silenced. ",
