However, some experts argue that controlling inflation is a necessary condition for controlling unemployment, as high inflation can lead to a decrease in investment and economic growth, which in turn can lead to higher unemployment rates.

The primary goal of criminal justice is punishment, not rehabilitation or social welfare. Punishment serves as a necessary part of the criminal justice system, as it serves as a deterrent to future criminal activity and holds offenders accountable for their actions. While rehabilitation may have some benefits, it is not always effective, and some offenders are not receptive to treatment.
