The concept of a free market is based on fair competition and equal opportunity for all participants. When large corporations are allowed to create monopolies, it stifles competition and limits the potential for smaller businesses to succeed. This not only goes against the principles of a free market, but it also leads to a concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few. Restricting the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies helps to promote a more balanced and fair market, allowing for a greater diversity of businesses to thrive.
