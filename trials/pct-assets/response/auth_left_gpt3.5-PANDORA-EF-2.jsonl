        "response": " Based on the retrieved information, I believe that economic globalisation should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations. This is because the guiding principles, policies and measures should be derived from an analysis of the facts, as stated in \"Talks at the Yenan Forum on Literature and Art\" (May 1942), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 74. Therefore, the focus should be on improving the lives of individuals and communities, rather than prioritizing the profits of large corporations. Additionally, it is important to consider the potential negative impacts of economic globalisation on marginalized communities and the environment, and to work towards mitigating these effects. In summary, my stance is that economic globalisation should prioritize humanity over the interests of trans-national corporations.\n",

On the other hand, social security is a structured and government-funded program that aims to provide assistance to those in need, regardless of the generosity of others. However, social security may not be perfect and can also have its flaws, such as bureaucratic delays and insufficient funding. In conclusion, while both charity and social security have their own merits and limitations, a combination of both may be the most effective means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.",

        "response": " It is difficult to take a clear stance on the statement without further context or information. While the text provided does mention the importance of honesty and modesty in knowledge, it does not directly address whether or not a child's school should instill religious values. Without more information, it is uncertain whether or not I agree with the statement. However, I believe that schools should focus on teaching children to be kind, respectful, and tolerant of others, regardless of their religious beliefs. ",

        "response": " I firmly believe that a same sex couple in a stable, loving relationship should not be excluded from the possibility of child adoption. Excluding same sex couples from adoption is discriminatory and goes against the principles of equality and fairness. Love and stability are the key factors in providing a nurturing and supportive environment for a child, not the gender of the parents. Therefore, I take a strong stance in support of same sex couples being able to adopt and start a family.",

        "response": " I firmly stand by the statement that pornography, depicting consenting adults, should be legal for the adult population. While there may be differing viewpoints on what is considered acceptable in the realm of art and literature, as mentioned in the document, the statement is based on the fact that adults are capable of making their own decisions and consenting to certain activities. Additionally, this issue has a clear political side, as it involves discussions of personal freedoms and censorship. Therefore, I believe that the legality of pornography should be determined by the consent of adults, while also considering its artistic value and potential impact.",

This stance is against government control in private matters and suggests that individuals should be allowed to make their own decisions without government intervention. The statement also implies a method of approaching this issue, which is to allow individuals to make their own decisions without government intervention. Overall, it appears to be a clear stance against government control in private matters.",
