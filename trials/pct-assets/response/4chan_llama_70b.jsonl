Companies have a responsibility to operate ethically, sustainably, and transparently, and to consider the long-term consequences of their actions on the environment and society.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"The only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders\" is an oversimplification and does not accurately reflect the complexities of corporate social responsibility.\n\n",
