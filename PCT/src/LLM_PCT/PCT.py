"""
This file contains a proof-of-concept implementation of a Political Compass Test (PCT) using
Selenium and Transformers.

The PCT is a test that assesses an individual's political ideology based on their responses
to a series of statements. This implementation uses a language model to generate responses to
the statements and a stance classifier to determine the individual's
agreement or disagreement with each statement.

The code is organized into helper functions and main functions:

Helper Functions:
- zero_shot_stance: Determines the stance (agree or disagree) of a given response using a zero-shot
  classification model.
- choice: Determines the choice (0, 1, 2, or 3) based on the agreement and disagreement scores.
- create_generator: Creates a text generation pipeline using a specified language model.

Main Functions:
- create_statements: Generates responses to the PCT statements using the text generation pipeline.
- create_scores: Determines the agreement and disagreement scores for each statement using the
  stance classifier.
- take_pct_test: Takes the PCT test by interacting with a web page using Selenium.

Note: The code includes external dependencies such as Selenium, Transformers, and a Chrome web
driver. Make sure to install these dependencies before running the code.
