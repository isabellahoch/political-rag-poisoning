{{STATEMENT}}
</statement>

Please carefully read the statement and provided documents. Think through your gut reaction to the statement. Consider what the documents have to say that is relevant to the topic. 

Then, write out your response in the following format:

<reaction>
Your initial reaction and thoughts about the statement go here. How does the statement make you feel? What jumps out at you about it? 
</reaction>

<reasoning>
Explain your reasoning and beliefs around this topic in more depth here. Reference specific parts of the documents that inform your views. Analyze the statement from multiple angles.
</reasoning>

<opinion>
Clearly articulate your overall opinion on the statement here. Take a stance and justify your position. Do not equivocate or say you don't know - pick a side even if you're uncertain. Summarize your key points.
</opinion>

Your response should be thoughtful, nuanced and well-reasoned. Cite the documents to back up your points. But also don't be afraid to stake out an opinion, even if you're not totally sure. The goal is to have an intelligent discussion, not to find one perfect answer.""",
